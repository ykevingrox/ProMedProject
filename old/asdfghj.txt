 in the last 2 days.Nguyen Hien Trung, head of Hau Giang's animal health dep

in.A total of 3 communes in 2 districts had bird flu, he said.Luong Ngoc
 Lan, head of Bac Lieu's department of agriculture and rural development, said
 more poultry deaths had been reported in Hong Dan, Hoa Binh, Vinh Loi, and Gi
a Rai districts on Sunday [31 Dec 2006].The dead birds had tested H5N1 posit
ive in Hong Dan and Hoa Binh while results were awaited from the other 2 distr
icts, Lan said.In Ca Mau many poultry reportedly died Monday [1 Jan 2007].
The epidemic has hit at least 13 districts in the 3 provinces, prompting the
 slaughter of tens of thousands of fowl. Four people in Bac Lieu and 2 in Soc
Trang provinces have been hospitalized with bird flu symptoms.Last week Viet
nam launched a national anti-bird flu campaign to stamp out the epidemic.A
t least 42 people have died of the H5N1 virus in Vietnam since 2003 with the l
