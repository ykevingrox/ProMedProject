The growth was largely attributed to abnormally warm weather conditions.  \"It was quicker and more widespread than any of us could have anticipated,\" said Chris Conlan, an ecologist with the San Diego County Vector Control Program.<br /><br />The yellow fever mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_) and Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) can carry diseases [viruses] linked to birth defects, painful illness and tens of thousands of deaths around the globe every year.  They can be identified by their black-and-white striped bodies and aggressive behavior toward people, often following them indoors. Smaller than average mosquitoes, these pests distinguish themselves as daytime feeders. They're tough to eradicate, needing as little as a thimble of water to reproduce.<br /><br />After months of tracking the growing population of yellow fever mosquitoes, local vector-control officials cringed in September 2015 when they found the Asian tiger mosquito as well. Both species of the insect were 1st located near San Diego's shipyards, although it's unclear how they first came into this county.<br /><br />\"In many cases, when the technicians go out ... to respond to complaints [about the mosquitoes], they're even swatting them out of their face,\" Conlan said. \"In a couple of places, it has reached very troubling numbers -- San Ysidro and some areas around Barrio Logan to Logan Heights. It's pretty widespread down there.\"<br /><br />So far, California has seen no locally acquired cases of disease spread by these mosquitoes, which include dengue fever, yellow fever and chikungunya. A mosquito must bite an infected person to then pass along a malady [virus].  This year, travelers returning to California have reported 99 cases of dengue and 178 cases of chikungunya [virus infection]. There have been no reported cases of yellow fever.<br /><br />West Nile virus remains a more immediate threat among mosquito-related illnesses, but that could change, said Marco Metzger, senior public health biologist in the vector-borne-disease section at the California Department of Public Health. \"What we're dealing with is an emerging concern,\" he said. \"If these [mosquitoes] become widely successful in California, we have the potential for disease transmission.  \"We don't have any mosquitoes that live so closely associated with humans,\" he added. \"These mosquitoes are notorious in so many parts of the world because they live with us.\"<br /><br />Public-health officials are urging residents who see these invasive pests on their properties to take action before temperatures heat up. Mosquito season usually starts in March and peaks between August and November.  With a limited flight distance, the mosquitoes likely breed near where they're spotted. The saucers of potted plants, plastic toys that fill with water and clogged rain gutters offer fertile breeding opportunities. The mosquitoes' eggs can survive without water for months, requiring infested sites to be scrubbed down thoroughly.<br /><br />\"For these guys, more so than ever, we really need the public's help in eliminating the standing water sources to make sure they don't become more of a problem,\" Conlan said.<br /><br />1st found in California in 2013, _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ have roughly tripled in number around the state during the past several seasons. They're now found in 82 cities, including Escondido, Los Angeles, Fresno and parts of the Bay Area. At the beginning of this year [2015], the count was 28 cities.  But beyond being a growing public nuisance, it's unclear what threat level these mosquitoes present. East Coast and Midwest cities have long tolerated the pests without serious incident.<br /><br />While Mexico and the Caribbean have suffered the effects of dengue and chikungunya for some time, less than a dozen people in the contiguous United States, all in Florida, have ever become sick from being bitten by a mosquito carrying either disease. [Not all cases have been in Florida -- see comment at end. - Mod.TY]<br /><br />Yellow fever has been largely confined to tropical areas of South America and Africa. A vaccine for travelers has significantly limited transmission of the disease into western countries.  Meanwhile, a virus linked to the mosquitoes known as Zika has spread throughout Brazil, [suspected of] causing thousands of cases of brain damage in babies born with abnormally small heads. But the United State has never had a recorded case of Zika.<br /><br />Still, public-health officials warn that it's better to be vigilant about prevention.  \"The concern is that if and when these mosquitoes become well-established in the state and abundant in our neighborhoods, then the risk of transmission increases,\" Metzger said.<br /><br />[Byline: Joshua Emerson Smith]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<br />&lt;promed@promedmail.org><br /><br />[This report provides a good update on the sites where these 2 species have been found very recently. Both of these _Aedes_ species continued to be found in new localities in Southern California in 2015, and some of these California localities are places where _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been reported in earlier ProMED-mail posts.<br /><br />Although the risk of imported dengue, chikungunya or Zika viruses sparking a local outbreak is low, it is not zero. In recent years, there has been local dengue virus transmission in Florida involving _Ae. aegypti_ and in Long Island, New York, transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_. These small outbreaks have been initiated by the arrival of viremic individuals from endemic countries.<br /><br />The fact that the vector mosquito populations in California are low so far, certainly significantly reduces the risk of an outbreak with ongoing transmission being initiated there. The aggressive and well-organized surveillance and control measures being carried out in California will likely keep those vector populations at a low level, but, as the above article indicates, cooperation by citizens at the local level is important for elimination of mosquito breeding sites.<br /><br />The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <a href=\"http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204\">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204</a>.
