The Daily Telegraph [edited] <http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/legionnaires-outbreak-may-have-started-at-st-george-hospital/news-story/acc5341360eaf025eaf1d63415352a3e>Three people hospitalised with legionnaires' disease in southern Sydney may have contracted the illness in the very hospital [St George Hospital in Kogarah, New South Wales] they are recovering in. Two men, aged 64 and 76, and one woman, 85, are currently being treated for the bacterial lung infection at St George Hospital.It was determined the 3 patients had all visited St George Hospital and certain areas around Kogarah between 22 and 26 Mar [2016]. Experts are testing the cooling towers at the hospital and surrounding areas. NSW [New South Wales] Health and Kogarah Council investigators began examining cooling towers within those areas to try and isolate the source of the disease, but it was an earlier test result that may shed some light on the outbreak. A cooling tower that was tested on 22 Mar [2016] returned a positive result for _Legionella_, but officials only received the results yesterday [31 Mar 2016].The dates appear to match up to the time the 3 patients could have contracted the disease, but Director of South Eastern Sydney Local Health District's Public Health Unit Professor Mark Ferson said the hospital's water cooler [sic; presumably the cooling tower, not a drinking water cooler] wasn't necessarily the source of the infection.[Byline: David Meddows] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Photo of cooling tower: <http://www.davidcoateconsulting.com/upmc1.jpg>. - Mod.JWThe St George Hospital and Community Health Service is a major tertiary and teaching referral hospital located in Kogarah, a southern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, located 14 kilometres [about 9 miles] south of the Sydney central business district (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George_Hospital_(Sydney)>).People with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and smokers are particularly at risk for severe disease. Although _Legionella_ infection is usually thought to be acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols that are generated, for example, by a building's cooling tower or a lobby fountain, sometimes aspiration of contaminated water is thought to be the mechanism (1,2). Aspiration may be especially a problem in elderly, debilitated, or neurologically impaired patients in a hospital or nursing facility. Dr Victor Yu was the 1st to suggest that the mode of transmission for legionnaires' disease is aspiration of contaminated water rather than aerosolization, as is widely assumed and _Legionella_-contaminated potable water systems are the source. He has nicely reviewed this topic (3). Aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated water is also the obvious source for neonatal legionnaires' disease that has occurred following use of _Legionella_-contaminated home birthing pools (4-6).Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (8,9). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.References----------1.
