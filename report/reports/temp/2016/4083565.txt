Due to the seasonal pattern, our risk assessment shows that the activity of avian influenza viruses is expected to remain at a high level in winter months. Human H5N6 and H7N9 cases have been recorded in the Mainland since this winter [2015-16]. Locally, birds positive for H5N6 and an imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) were also detected this winter.
