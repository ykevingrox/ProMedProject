Thanh Nien News [edited]<http://www.thanhniennews.com/health/encephalitis-outbreak-feared-after-7-infant-deaths-in-northern-vietnam-62628.html>At least 7 babies in the mountainous province of Cao Bang died the past 5 weeks possibly due to viral encephalitis, raising concerns about an outbreak.The province's health department said 7 babies less than 6 months died in 1 district between 19 Apr and 25 May [2016], and 12 others are under treatment with similar symptoms that include fever, cough, and respiratory inflammation.Experts from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology who visited the children suspected that they suffer from viral encephalitis. It is a rare but acute condition that causes inflammation of the brain and usually starts with flu-like symptoms.The fatalities are very high compared to only 3 encephalitis deaths reported from all other places in the country this year [2016]. The exact virus and strain in these 7 cases have not been identified.Tran Dac Phu, head of the Preventive Health Department at the health ministry, said the disease peaks between June and August. It is a dangerous one because late treatment can leave severe damage to the nervous system. People can be infected through insects' bites, ingestion, or inhaling. Children under 15 are more vulnerable.Viet Nam provides vaccination against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) for children from 1 year old.But protection against other encephalitis virus groups such as herpes and enterovirus is not available yet. The latter causes the hand-foot-mouth disease that claims many children lives in Viet Nam every year.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
