WMC Action News 5 [edited]<http://www.wdam.com/story/31868309/shelby-county-measles-outbreak-may-have-spread-to-mississippi>Mississippi is now looking into 4 possible measles cases. The 4 people were not vaccinated against the virus, and they were exposed to measles in Shelby County, Tennessee.No cases have been confirmed in Mississippi to date, but if any of these 4 people end up being a confirmed case, it will mean a growth in the outbreak that began in Shelby County at the end of April [2016]. The patients in Mississippi are all under home quarantine.""Measles is literally knocking at our back door,"" Epidemiologist Dr. Thomas Dobb said. ""This is a highly contagious, airborne disease and is easily spread from person to person. Unvaccinated individuals are highly susceptible to infection. This is a potentially deadly virus; infants and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of Tennessee in the USA may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/244>]******[2] Measles: New Zealand (Waikato)Date: Tue 3 May 2016Source: Radio New Zealand [edited]<http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/bites/302917/eleven-measles-cases-confirmed-in-waikato>A total of 11 cases of measles have been confirmed in Waikato and a further 13 cases are under investigation. Medical Officer of Health Richard Wall said 5 of the suspected cases are people who attended a Tainui Waka Kapa Haka Festival 2 weeks ago, which was also attended by a person already infected with measles.The incubation period for measles is about 2 weeks, so most people who were at the festival will have become unwell by now if they were going to get the virus. But a few could still get it this week, Dr Wall said.Measles usually starts with a fever, cough, runny nose and eyes, followed by a rash 2 -- 5 days later.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[More than 5000 people are reported to have attended the Tainui Waka Kapa Haka Festival, so more cases are likely to be reported.During an outbreak in 2014, there were 125 measles cases in Hamilton [NZ]. 4 of those were considered fully immunized. A total of 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) provide 95 to 98 percent immunity.Waikato District Health Board (DHB) medical officer of health, F Dumble, said when an outbreak occurs, the DHB will urge parents to vaccinate earlier than the usual age of 15 months. Children can be vaccinated from the age of 6 months but will still need to get another dose at 15 months and then again at 4 years.Measles is spread by tiny droplets in the air and is one of the few diseases that can spread easily to those nearby. Symptoms don't appear for at least 2 weeks after exposure. The 1st symptoms are fever, runny nose, cough and sore, runny eyes. The rash starts later.(excerpted from <http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/79526866/more-come-forward-with-measles-at-least-10-confirmed-cases-in-the-waikato>)A map of New Zealand may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164> - Mod.LK][A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2914>.]
