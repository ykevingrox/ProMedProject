DW (Deutsche Welle) [edited]<http://www.dw.com/en/germany-denmark-step-up-bird-flu-controls/a-36393478>The German state of Schleswig-Holstein widened protection measures on Monday [14 Nov 2016] to protect against an outbreak of the H5N8 influenza virus among wild birds, which has spread to poultry.All farms -- including smallholdings -- will be required to tighten biosecurity, with the use of protective clothing and footwear, and the widespread disinfection of all farm buildings and vehicles used to transport poultry.Over the weekend, 30 000 chickens were culled as a precaution at a farm close to the northern city of Grumby, which saw an outbreak of the virus. The affected breeder farm is currently being disinfected and cleaned, Schleswig-Holstein's environment ministry said on Mon 14 Nov 2016.Two smaller poultry farms in the same state and the neighboring Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania were also affected over the weekend, but neither states registered new H5N8 cases on Monday [14 Nov 2016], local officials said.So far, 5 German states have seen bird flu outbreaks, including the southern state of Baden-WÌ rttemberg, which reported cases around Lake Constance, which is bordered by Switzerland and Austria. The state of Saxony also confirmed that the H5N8 virus was detected in a dead heron at a lake near the city of Leipzig.On Monday [14 Nov 2016], Denmark sought to contain its own outbreak among wild birds by ordering a farm to destroy hundreds of thousands of eggs imported from Germany as a precaution. Some 300 000 eggs from the farm in Grumby were supplied to a hatchery in the Danish town of Baekke, near Kolding. They are all expected to be destroyed by Tuesday [15 Nov 2016].Denmark ordered flocks of poultry to be kept indoors from midnight on Tuesday [15 Nov 2016]. Several German states have also instigated similar policies for their domestic and commercial livestock.German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt said on Monday [14 Nov 2016] that the country was considering a nationwide order to bring all flocks indoors.Ahead of a meeting in Brussels, Schmidt said he would consult with other European countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Denmark, which are also affected.Meanwhile, Hungary confirmed that 3 more of its municipalities were now fighting the latest bird flu outbreak, bringing the total to 5. Several countries, including Canada, Israel and Serbia have already placed restrictions on poultry imports from Hungary amid concerns other countries may face similar curbs.The latest bird flu outbreak comes ahead of the upcoming Christmas season, which is a critical time for sales for European poultry farmers. The H5N8 pathogen is considered safe for humans but is a significant threat to domestic poultry.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Switzerland implements compulsory housing of poultryDate: Tue 15 Nov 2016Source: The Stopru (Quebec provincial newspaper, Canada) [edited]<http://stopru.org/bird-flu-switzerland-decides-to-confine-domestic-poultry/24671>""From 16 Nov 2016, the entire Swiss territory will be considered as a control zone, with the aim of preventing contact between wild birds and domestic poultry throughout the territory,"" the Federal Office of Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs [Switzerland] said in a statement.""To prevent any contact between wild birds and domestic poultry, the feeding and drinking of these birds must be done in a closed chicken house, inaccessible to the birds located outside,"" he explained.If these restrictions cannot be applied, Berne requires that these animals be ""placed in closed premises or poultry houses with an impermeable roof and closed side walls.""The avian influenza virus subtype H5N8 -- which is not transmissible to humans, unlike H5N1 -- has been identified in dead wild birds around Lake Constance, Lake Geneva and Lake NeuchÌ¢tel.Around Lake Constance, dead birds have been discovered both in the Swiss, German and Austrian territories, according to a statement published by Switzerland on 8 Nov 2016.--Communicated by:Sabine ZentisCastleview English LonghornsGut Laach, D-52385 NideggenGermany<cvlonghorns@aol.com>******[3] Correction regarding bird nomenclature (Switzerland)Date: Mon 14 Nov 2016From: Martin Gilbert <m.gilbert@cornell.edu> [edited]I am writing to make a small correction to your report dated 13 Nov 2016, ""Avian influenza (99): Switzerland (VD) wild, India (KA) poultry, H5N8."" The report includes a reference to a ""laughing gull"" found dead on Lake Geneva from which avian influenza was detected. The English name used for this species is misleading, as the laughing gull (_Leucophaeus atricilla_) is a North American species and is an extremely rare visitor to Switzerland. Rather, the species concerned was almost certainly a black-headed gull (_Chroicocephalus ridibundus_).In a confusing quirk of nomenclature, ""ridibundus"" translates as ""laughing,"" and is the likely source of the error.--Martin GilbertWildlife Veterinarian, Senior Research AssociateCollege of Veterinary MedicineCornell University<m.gilbert@cornell.edu>[We are grateful to Martin, who has been kindly helping ProMED-mail along in ornithological and other matters, for the correction above. A similar comment was received from Thijs Kuiken (Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) who added: ""Theconfusion is understandable, since the German name for black-headed gull is LachmÌÄå¦weÌâ"" and the French name is Ìâ""mouette rieuse [laughing gull].The following follow-up notifications to the OIE on new HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in Europe have become available this week:Poland,15 Nov 2016, follow-up report No 1: <http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21547>Hungary, 14 Nov 2016, follow-up No 1: <http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21543>Germany, 14 Nov 2016, follow-up No 2: <http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21541>ProMED-mail has been told that Germany is about to follow Switzerland and Denmark in the application of countrywide compulsory housing of poultry and that animal welfare problems may arise, since geese, kept on holdings for Christmas trade, are free range. It will not be a surprise if other European countries (and elsewhere, e.g. Israel) act similarly. - Mod.AS]
