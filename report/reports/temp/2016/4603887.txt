Times Union [edited]<http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Saratoga-Legionnaire-s-outbreak-expands-to-13-10446960.php>[New York] State health officials have expanded their investigation of legionnaire's disease in the Saratoga Springs area, following the diagnosis of 13 patients with the pneumonia-like illness.Of the patients with the illness, 7 have spent time at the Wesley Health Care Center [Saratoga Springs] in recent weeks. It is unknown whether any of the other 6 patients have an association with the nursing home, according to the [New York] state Health Department.Of the patients known to have connections to Wesley, 2 have died. Though legionnaire's disease can be fatal, state health officials stressed that those 2 patients had other serious medical conditions.The source of the _Legionella_ bacterium that causes the illness has not been found. The bacterium does not [usually] spread from person to person, but is usually breathed in through small droplets of water, as in a mist.""The investigation is ongoing and there are several potential sources being investigated,"" the state Health Department said in a statement. Neither the Health Department nor Saratoga Hospital would say [Tue 1 Nov 2016] how many of the legionnaire's patients had been at Saratoga Hospital. One patient told the Times Union the hospital was the only place she could have contracted the illness, except for her own home. Saratoga Hospital had identified at least 4 of the patients, in reports to Wesley, on [13 Oct and 20 Oct 2016], according to a previous statement from the nursing home. Peter Hopper, a spokesman for the hospital said there was no evidence that patients contracted the illness at the hospital. ""There is no record or indication of a patient contracting legionella disease as a result of exposure at Saratoga Hospital,"" he said.The 13 patients were diagnosed with legionnaire's disease at multiple medical facilities, according to the Health Department.Wesley Health Care Center has complied with regulations for testing cooling towers and other equipment, and is evaluating its water system, the nursing home said [Tue 1 Nov 2016] in a statement.One of the patients to get legionnaire's disease said she was only in 2 places during the 10-day period when she could have contracted the illness. [The 58-year-old woman] had minor foot surgery at the hospital on [Thu 13 Oct 2016], and stayed overnight there. 10 days later, she had chills -- ""horrific ones"" -- fever and shortness of breath. ""The shortness of breath is really startling,"" said [the patient], who suffers regularly from severe asthma. ""That's the most acute thing that I felt. You took 2 steps and sat down, got up and took 2 steps."" She returned to the hospital at 6 am on [Mon 24 Oct 2016], she said. She was there until [Fri 28 Oct 2016], when doctors told her she had tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria. Within an hour, she said, state health investigators were questioning her by telephone. [The patient], who is home and feeling better on antibiotics, said it seems clear to her that the source of the _Legionella_ bacteria can only be one of 2 places. ""I've only been to the hospital and home -- nowhere else -- so that kind of tightens it up, if you know what I mean,"" [she] said. ""It's not like they have to look all over. It's either here or there."" No one has been to her home to look at her water supplies, [she] said.[Byline: Claire Hughes]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions. A member of the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project also submitted this news report.A previous ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis - USA (22): (NY) healthcare facility, RFI 20161022.4578048) reported 4 patients with legionnaires' disease associated with the Wesley Health Care Center in Saratoga Springs, New York State. Now there are 13 patients with the pneumonia-like illness in the Saratoga Springs area, 7 of the whom spent time at the Wesley Health Care Center in recent weeks. 2 of the 7 have died. An association with this nursing home is unknown for the other 6 patients.The Wesley Community is a not-for-profit organization, which includes the Wesley Health Care Center, Woodlawn Commons, Embury Apartments, and Wesley Evergreen Adult Day Services that provide ""many levels of care for the aging resident and others"" with long-term care residences, as well as short-term rehabilitation (<http://www.thewesleycommunity.org/about-wesley-community/>). A map of the facility's campus is available at <http://www.thewesleycommunity.org/about-wesley-community/campus-map/>.Saratoga Springs is a city in Saratoga County in New York State, 36 miles (58 km/36 mi) north of Albany, the state capital city (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York>).The source of this outbreak is still unknown. Usually the disease is acquired by inhalation of an infectious aerosol generated by, for example, fountains or cooling towers. These aerosols can spread for a distance downwind from the source, so that an infected individual might not have been in a building cooled by the incriminated tower, but just in its vicinity. For example, in the 1976 outbreak in Philadelphia, most cases of legionnaires' disease were at a convention held at a particular downtown hotel, but some patients, called at the time ""Broad Street"" pneumonia cases were only passers-by within the vicinity of the hotel (<https://www.nap.edu/read/4795/chapter/32#437>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9429>.]
