Becker's Infection Control & Clinical Quality [edited]<http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/uw-medical-center-s-legionnaires-outbreak-continues-5th-patient-infected.html>A 5th patient at University of Washington [UW] Medical Center in Seattle has contracted a _Legionella_ bacterial infection, days after the hospital said its legionnaires' disease outbreak had likely been contained. The newly diagnosed patient had been hospitalized twice in the medical center's Cascade Tower where the outbreak occurred. After an investigation, officials now believe the patient contracted the infection either in the community or during the hospitalization earlier in September [2016], before the hospital instituted water restrictions.UW Medical Center instituted water precautions [13 Sep 2016] and performed hyper-chlorination of the tower's water system [20 Sep 2016] to eradicate the bacteria from the system after 4 patients contracted legionnaires' disease. An investigation had revealed _Legionella_ bacteria were dwelling in sinks, ice machines, and operating room devices [3 heater cooler units] in the hospital's Cascade Tower.Because the 5th infection is believed to have taken place before water precautions were lifted [20 Sep 2016], the water restrictions will not be reinstituted in the Cascade Tower.UW Medical Center is still working with the CDC and Public Health-Seattle & King County on the outbreak, and the hospital is testing samples from patients who had tests ordered for a lung infection for [_Legionella_]. [Presumably, the tests referred to are genotyping the _Legionella_ isolates.]._Legionella_ bacteria can cause legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia that can be deadly. 2 of the 5 infected UW Medical Center patients have died.Editor's note------------This story was updated [28 Sep 2016] at 8:45 CT to reflect new information from UW Medical Center. Previously, officials did not know if the 5th patient became infected before or after the hospital instituted water precautions and cleaned the water system.[Byline: Heather Punkee]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Clinical isolates from the 1st 4 patients and the environmental isolates (ice machine, sinks, and heater cooler units) are said to be _Legionella pneumophila_. We await results of genotyping to confirm if this is a common source outbreak. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55573>.]
