Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-hongkong-idUSKBN1490DW>Hong Kong authorities have confirmed the 1st human bird flu infection for this season [2016-17] after an elderly man who had recently traveled to mainland China was diagnosed with the deadly H7N9 virus strain.The 75-year-old male patient, who had visited the southern Chinese town of Changping in Dongguan city this month [December 2016] before returning to Hong Kong, is in serious condition, the government said in a statement released late on Monday [19 Dec 2016]. The case came to light as South Korea and Japan ordered further culls on Monday to contain outbreaks of a different strain of bird flu, having already killed tens of millions of birds in the past month.Hong Kong has been battling sporadic cases of avian influenza in humans since the 1st outbreak killed 6 people in the Asian financial hub in 1997.Macau, a former Portuguese colony an hour away from Hong Kong by ferry, culled about 10 000 chickens last week [week of 12 Dec 2016] after a wholesale poultry market worker fell ill with the H7N9 strain.The city temporarily suspended importing poultry from mainland China but resumed trade on [Sun 18 Dec 2016].[Byline: Venus Wu, editing by Paul Tait]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] WHO updateDate: Fri 23 Dec 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/23-december-2016-ah7n9-china/en/>On 20 Dec 2016, the Department of Health (DOH), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of a case of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus [see above].Details of the case-------------------The case is a 75-year-old man who travelled to Dongguan, Guangdong province from 28 Nov to 9 Dec 2016. He developed chest discomfort on [8 Dec 2016] and he visited a hospital there. He returned to Hong Kong SAR on [9 Dec 2016] and was directly admitted to hospital from point of entry by ambulance for cough with sputum, shortness of breath, runny nose, and chest discomfort.His nasopharyngeal swab taken on [9 Dec 2016] tested positive for enterovirus/ rhinovirus and negative for influenza virus. His nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) taken on [19 Dec 2016] was positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA. He was reported to be in severe condition at the time of report. His condition further deteriorated to critical on [21 Dec 2016]. He had visited a wet market in Dongguan and bought a dressed chicken. DOH's investigation is ongoing, and DOH is communicating with the Guangdong health authority.To date, a total of 808 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.Public health response----------------------The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health has taken the following measures:- urged the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene, both locally and during travel;- issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools, and institutions of the latest situation.WHO risk assessment-------------------Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.WHO advice----------WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] FujianDate: Thu 22 Dec 2016Source: Global Times, Xinhua News Agency report [edited]<http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025073.shtml>A new human H7N9 avian flu case was reported in Xiamen City, east China's Fujian Province, local authorities said [Wed 21 Dec 2016].The patient, a 44-year-old man from Siming District of Xiamen, was confirmed to have the virus on [Sun 18 Dec 2016]. He is being treated in hospital and is stable condition, the city's diseases prevention and control center said. The district government has ordered a halt to poultry sales in the district as of [Thu 22 Dec 2106] to reduce the risk of infection.H7N9 is a bird flu strain first reported to have infected humans in March 2013 in China. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Anhui (fatal), Macau, ShanghaiDate: Sat 24 Dec 2016Source: The Star [edited]<http://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2016/12/24/first-two-human-deaths-from-bird-flu-reported/>Two people in China's Anhui province have died from H7N9 bird flu, the 1st fatalities in China among this winter's [20160-2017] cases, while Macau reported its 1st human H7N9 infection since the former Portuguese colony returned to China in 1999.Anhui has reported 5 cases of H7N9 avian flu since [8 Dec 2016], including the 2 people who died, the eastern province's health authority said in a statement dated [21 Dec 2016], posted on its website. However, the statement did not say whether the other 3 people had recovered or not.The Anhui cases bring the total number of people infected with the H7N9 virus in mainland China this month [December 2016] to at least 7.H7N9 had not been detected in either humans or animals in China until March 2013.The strain does not seem to transmit easily from person to person, and sustained human-to-human infection has not been reported, according to the World Health Organization.The danger with any such virus is that it mutates and acquires genetic changes that might increase its pandemic potential.The last major bird flu outbreak in mainland China -- from late 2013 to early 2014 -- killed 36 people and led to more than USD 6 billion in losses for the agricultural sector.Health authorities in Shanghai said on [21 Dec 2016] a man diagnosed with the H7N9 strain was being treated there, after travelling from the neighbouring province of Jiangsu. Shanghai is China's biggest city with more than 24 million residents. The local government in Jiangsu was looking into the origin of the infection, the provincial health authority said yesterday [23 Dec 2016].In Xiamen, a city in Fujian province also in the east, authorities ordered a halt to poultry sales from yesterday [22 Dec 2016] in the Siming district, after a 44-year-old man was diagnosed with H7N9 flu [see [3] above], state news agency Xinhua reported on [Wed 21 Dec 2016]. The patient was in hospital and was stable, Xinhua said then. The city has a population of about 3.5 million.Hong Kong this week also had reported its 1st human bird flu infection for this season [see [1] and [2] above].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[More human cases of influenza A/H7N9 including 2 deaths continue have been reported from China and adjoining regions. Most cases have a documented history of exposure to poultry. With minimal or no signs of apparent infection in poultry, it is challenging to advise at-risk individuals involved in handling poultry and therefore surveillance activities need to be continued. - Mod.UBAMaps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
