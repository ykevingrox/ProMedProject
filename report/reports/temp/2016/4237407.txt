The department says the cases involve 2 people bitten by ticks in mountainous areas of southern Arizona.According to the department, there have only been 40 cases of the disease in the United States since it was 1st recognized in 2004, and the tick that carries the disease was hardly known in Arizona. The disease is named _Rickettsia parkeri_ rickettsiosis. The tick is _Amblyomma triste_.Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and a dark scab at the site of the tick bite. The department advises wearing long sleeves and pants and using insect repellant when doing outdoor activities.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website Other Tick-borne Spotted Fever Rickettsial Infections (<http://www.cdc.gov/otherspottedfever/>):""In addition to _Rickettsia rickettsii_, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), several other tick-borne species of _Rickettsia_, broadly grouped under the heading ""Spotted Fever group Rickettsia (SFGR)"" have been shown to cause human infections. Tick-borne SFGR are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick, and may cause similar signs and symptoms to those observed for RMSF. These pathogens include several species of _Rickettsia_ found in the United States, including _R. parkeri_ and _Rickettsia_ species 364D (Table1). In addition, numerous tick-borne SFGR pathogenic to humans have been described internationally, including but not limited to _R. conorii_ and _R. africae_ (Table 2). Travelers may be at risk for exposure to these pathogens when engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for tick exposure, and physicians should maintain awareness of these diseases when a patient presents with a febrile illness within 2 weeks of returning home. Rickettsial infections with _R. africae_ have been reported as a common cause of fever in travelers returning from South Africa.""""The initial symptoms of tick-borne SFGR infections generally include fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. A maculopapular or petechial rash may be present, and frequently a distinctive eschar (blackened or crusted skin) may develop at the site of a tick bite. Multiple eschars may be present if more than one tick bite occurred. The observance of an eschar at the site of tick bite may provide the clinician with a diagnostic clue that can help differentiate the infection from RMSF, although eschars may also be rarely reported with R. rickettsii infection. The severity of illness may vary depending on the species. For example, human infections with _R. parkeri_ and _R. africae_ are generally considered mild and to some extent self-limiting infections. In contrast, _R. conorii_ and some other SFGR infections may be more severe. Prompt treatment with doxycycline is recommended if tick-borne SFGR is suspected, and should never be delayed pending the outcome of diagnostic tests.""""Different SFGR pathogens cause immune reactions in humans that can be difficult to distinguish with antibody-based laboratory techniques. Because these agents exhibit serologic cross-reactivity with available tests for _R. rickettsii_, some human illnesses currently being attributed to RMSF in the United States may actually be caused by other SFGR, such as _R. parkeri_, _Rickettsia_ 364D, or imported spotted fevers.""Although the severity of infections attributable to SFGR vary greatly depending on the causative species, all suspect patients should be treated as if they have _R. rickettsii_ infection. Physicians seeking confirmation of infection with a SFGR pathogen may elect to use commercially available serologic assays that diagnose RMSF, and should report it as a case of ""Spotted Fever Rickettsiosis"" to their state health department. Additional methods that may be used to help identify the causative agent include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and culture isolation of a swab or biopsy from an eschar or rash site. Specimens should be submitted to the state health department in the state where the patient resides, who can submit the samples to CDC for testing.
