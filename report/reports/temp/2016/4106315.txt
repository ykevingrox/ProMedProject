Although the circumstances under which the patient acquired his CCHF virus infection are not stated, the cattle with which his is in contact, or perhaps their ticks, are the source. The infections could have been acquired via tick bite or via exposure to the blood of an infected animal.The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.A map of the provinces of Pakistan can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html> and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/941>. - Mod.TY]
