They expressed concerns over the unexpected outbreak of the disease in the village, which devoured 5 lives during the past 2 weeks.Besides the 5 kids who died due to diphtheria, 12 more children are suffering from the disease and have been referred to Lahore Children Hospital. Kanganpur Hospital neither has the capacity to serve the patients nor facilities to treat them properly, they said.""As the kids died due to diphtheria, the unexpected spread of the disease and appearance of 12 more cases sparked panic across the village and the residents, having no resources to prevent their children falling victim to the disease, engulfed by an unknown fear,"" they regretted.[Byline: Muhammad Ashraf Mehar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from moderator LL's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Diphtheria - Pakistan: (PB) fatalities 20151208.3845800:""Certainly, the lack of diphtheria anti-toxin [may be] an issue here for the treatment of individuals who have developed diphtheria. Primary protection against deaths from this toxin-mediated disease is, however, vaccination with toxoid to prevent the disease itself.""Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants.""The following is extracted in part from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Diphtheria - India: (Haryana) fatal, suspected 20120908.1285940:""Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is not manufactured as a monovalent vaccine; it is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters ""DT"") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, ""Td"") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap).""In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf>). The fully immunized person who is exposed can become a carrier of the bacterium but may only develop a mild case, or may not get sick at all. But if not fully vaccinated, the risk of getting severely ill is 30 times higher (<http://www.vaccinews.net/diseases_vaccines.php>).""A further discussion of diphtheria can be found in moderator ML's comments in ProMED post Diphtheria - Norway ex Mozambique: cutaneous, traveler 20140621.2556752.Maps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37952>.
