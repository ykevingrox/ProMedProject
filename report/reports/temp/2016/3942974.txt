He also said a team from WHO had already visited the hospital for assessment, adding that the hospital had been decontaminated and that those who had contact with the late physician had been placed on observation.He said: ""Last night [14 Jan 2015], one of our hard-working doctors in the department of obstetrics gynaecology lost his life following infection with Lassa fever. This is the price medical doctors and health personnel pay for offering health services to the public. The hospital is being decontaminated as we speak. All medical doctors and healthcare personnel that had primary contact with the late medical doctor have been placed under observation.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The death of a health care worker is tragic indeed. Transmission of Lassa fever virus in hospital settings is not unusual, so barrier nursing and personal protection equipment are important.Maps of Nigeria can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Abuja, Federal Capital TerritoryDate: Wed 13 Jan 2016Source: Global Post [edited]<http://www.globalpost.com/article/6719420/2016/01/13/lassa-fever-claims-first-death-nigerian-capital>One person has died from Lassa fever in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, taking deaths from the virus countrywide to 43, the health minister said on Wednesday [13 Jan 2016].The victim, the 1st to succumb to the virus in the capital, died in the National Hospital in central Abuja, a day after being transferred from a private medical centre in the suburb of Kubwa, Isaac Adewole said in a statement from his office.The 33-year-old from the central city of Jos had recently married and been in Kubwa to visit family, he added.""The minister has directed that all primary and secondary contacts of the victim should be tracked,"" including healthcare staff, and vigilance increased, the statement said.""The latest death from Lassa fever brings the total number of deaths to 43 in the country from 10 states.""Adewole 1st announced the suspected outbreak last Friday [8 Jan 2016], despite the 1st case of the disease being recorded in November [2015] in the northeastern state of Bauchi. Of the affected states, 7 are in the north, with 3 others in the south.Lassa fever is an acute haemorrhagic illness which belongs to the arenavirus family of viruses, which also includes the Ebola-like Marburg virus, according to the World Health Organization. [This is incorrect; the Ebola and Marburg viruses are in a different family, the filoviruses, although the clinical disease they cause is similar. - Mod.TY ]People with Lassa fever do not display symptoms in 80 percent of cases, but it can cause serious symptoms and death in the remainder.The virus is endemic in rodents in West Africa and is transmitted to humans by contact with food or household items contaminated with the animals' faeces and urine. Person-to-person contact is also possible through bodily fluids, particularly in hospitals when adequate infection control measures are not taken.The number of Lassa fever infections in West Africa every year is between 100 000 - 300 000, with about 5000 deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Adewole said the public should not panic because of the latest case, but anyone with symptoms should seek medical attention.Lassa fever outbreaks are not uncommon in Nigeria: in 2012, 1723 cases were recorded with 112 fatalities, but rates have declined since then, the minister said last week.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Because the Health Minister indicated that the 1st of these cases occurred in November 2015, it is not clear how many of the 43 cases to date, nationally, occurred in 2015 and how many in 2016. Public education to avoid conatct with rodent reservoirs and their excreta is important to avoid exposure to the virus.As noted in the comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150228.3199551: ""Lassa fever virus [LFV] is endemic in Nigeria, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country.""LFV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with an infected individual's viremic blood in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Several cases of transmission have occurred in hospitals.As the late Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived posting 20130131.1524034: ""In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multisystem disease. Rarely, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients.""The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the reservoir rodent host. In the absence of adequate infection control measures, person-to-person virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments, or in laboratories testing samples from patients.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>.]
