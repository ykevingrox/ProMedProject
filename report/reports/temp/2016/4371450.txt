The bat then bit her.The health department says it may have been the woman's natural instinct to want to help an injured animal, but she immediately knew she made the wrong decision.Angela Weidner, Macoupin County Health Department said, ""It's [rabies] 100% fatal; that's why we always treat. If you get rabies and [are] not treated, it will kill you.""Health officials say the bat was sent to a state lab in Springfield, Illinois. The bat was determined to be an eastern red bat, just one of the 13 species of bats found in Illinois, according to the health department. The bat tested positive for rabies.The health department says the woman has begun receiving treatment for rabies.""You automatically [should] go ahead and start treatment, because it needs to be started on day zero,"" said Weidner.The series of rabies shots can be expensive. The health department says that without insurance, the treatment runs about USD 2000.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species.Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these ""spillover events"" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species. - Mod.PMBA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/216>.]
