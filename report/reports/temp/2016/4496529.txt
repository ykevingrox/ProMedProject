Orange County Register [edited]<http://www.ocregister.com/articles/children-729073-tooth-hospitalized.html>Orange County's Health Care Agency on Thursday [15 Sep 2016] ordered Children's Dental Group in Anaheim to stop using water for procedures after 10 root canal patients were hospitalized with serious infections. The agency said its lab has confirmed that multiple samples taken from the dental office's water system have tested positive for mycobacteria similar to the kind believed to have sickened the children, who all underwent pulpotomies since May [2016].""I am issuing this order to protect the health of the dental office patients,"" Dr Eric Handler, the county's health officer, said in a statement. ""I'm requiring a complete replacement of the on-site water system so that we will remove the potential threat of infection.""Sam Gruenbaum, CEO of the company that owns the clinic, did not respond to a phone call or email seeking a comment on Thursday [15 Sep 2016]. He has previously said the clinic practiced industry-standard sanitation practices.The agency said the clinic must submit a written plan for replacement of the existing on-site water system for review and approval. From there, Children's Dental Group must replace all equipment that could be a source of mycobacteria. Finally, the agency said that ""all on-site water system renovation and replacement must be reviewed by HCA, including laboratory testing as appropriate, to assure patient safety.""Also on Thursday [15 Sep 2016], the Health Care Agency said 2 more children have been hospitalized. Lab results have confirmed _Mycobacterium abscessus_ in one patient, and results are pending for the other 2 probable cases. Earlier in the week, in an alert to physicians, the agency said 8 children had been sickened, with 7 hospitalized. All 10, however, were admitted for treatment at some point.Over a 4 month period, about 500 children underwent a pulpotomy, or baby-tooth root canal, before the clinic voluntarily stopped performing the procedures last week. The patients are being evaluated for symptoms of infection, such as fever and swelling. In a similar outbreak last year [2015] in Georgia, only a fraction of patients became ill.Dr Kevin Winthrop, who specializes in mycobacterial diseases at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, said multiple factors could be at play in who gets sick, including a difference in how a procedure was done or because a different instrument was used. ""It could be bad luck. It could be the age of the kid, and maybe their immune system is not as developed as an older kid's,"" Winthrop said. ""There's a lot to explore, and not always do you find an answer.""On Tuesday [13 Sep 2016], Gruenbaum said all children who had the procedure from May to September 2016 at the 2156 E Lincoln Ave office are being asked to return for a follow-up visit that will include an exam by a dentist, x-rays and questions about symptoms. Before Children's Dental Group closed on Thursday [15 Sep 2016] evening, a security guard stood at his post, and families with children rushed to their cars after exiting the office.Without the ability to use water, the clinic would be unable to perform most dental care, but could still take x-rays and examine patients for signs of infection, said Dr Harvey Lee, an Irvine pediatric dentist and president-elect of the Orange County Dental Society.Information for parents is available on the agency's website in English and Spanish at <http://ochealthinfo.com/dentaloutbreak>. The California Dental Board has opened an investigation and said that if parents have concerns about the care their children received, they can file a written complaint at <http://dbc.ca.gov/consumers/complaint_info.shtml>.Here are some answers to lingering questions about the outbreak connected to pulpotomy procedures at Children's Dental Group in Anaheim.Why are pulpotomies done? A pulpotomy, sometimes called a baby-tooth root canal, treats a cavity that has usually spread deep into a baby molar. Children typically receive nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, followed by an injection of local anesthetic. The procedure removes decay and infected pulp, fills the inside of the tooth with protective material and then covers the tooth in a stainless-steel crown. It is done to preserve a baby tooth, which is needed to save space for the permanent tooth to come in.Why have pulpotomies been the only dental procedure linked to the infections? Dr Harvey Lee, an Irvine pediatric dentist and president-elect of the Orange County Dental Society, said pulpotomies are common and normally very safe. But unlike during the filling of a cavity, soft tissue is exposed when the chamber of the tooth is exposed. ""There's blood vessels that enter the tooth at the end of the root, and nerves,"" Lee said. ""They're all housed in the same place and all opened up.""What is _Mycobacterium abscessus_? _Mycobacterium abscessus_ is a naturally occurring pathogen often found in tap water and is resistant to common disinfectants. Water can be contaminated by large amounts, particularly virulent strains, or a combination, causing skin, bone and soft-tissue infections, said Dr Kevin Winthrop, who specializes in mycobacterial diseases at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. ""This bug can be very aggressive,"" Winthrop said. ""It's hard to treat. It's highly drug-resistant.""Outbreaks have occurred after surgical or medical procedures, including a similar case last year [2015] at a Georgia dental clinic. Improper disinfection can be a cause, or maybe a new tool causes greater accumulation of mycobacteria, he said.What is the prognosis for the children with infections? The infection is treatable but often requires multiple intravenous antibiotics given for a long time.The parents of [a] 4 year old Children's Dental Group patient who was hospitalized for a month and underwent surgery, said this week that she could require 2 more months of antibiotic treatment. The Anaheim girl was treated at the clinic in June [2016].Winthrop said patients require very close monitoring, including for potentially bad side effects brought on by the powerful antibiotics. In severe cases, patients could require antibiotics for 6 months. ""If you have to treat it, it can be quite an endeavor,"" he said.[byline: Courtney Perkes]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Mycobacterium abscessus_ (formerly _M. chelonae_ subspecies _abscessus_) is an acid-fast bacillus that is part of a grouping separate from _M. tuberculosis_ complex that is known as non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (<http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html>). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate and colonial pigmentation. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing mycobacterial species (RGM) produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include the _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. The _M. abscessus_ subset includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_ and _M. bolletii_. (Pigmented, intermediately growing NTM require 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates and include _Mycobacterium marinum_ and _Mycobacterium gordonae_. Slowly growing NTM, which require more than 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates, include _Mycobacterium kansasii_ and the _Mycobacterium avium/intracellulare_ complex. Other slow growers include _M. ulcerans_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. simiae_.)NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, that can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of drinking water distribution systems, constituting a risk for certain patients both by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Water from these systems can also contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices -- for example, cosmetic surgery and open heart surgery. Also, nosocomial RGM infection has followed use of contaminated skin markers in cosmetic plastic surgery (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198707233170403>). Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. RGM also cause disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients.We are not told exactly where the _M. abscessus_ infections are occurring after root canal surgery in these children, whether they are dental infections or perhaps pulmonary. _M. abscessus_ in particular is capable of colonizing the respiratory tract and cause serious lung infections in persons with various chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, where its presence has been a contraindication to lung transplantation (<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249806003263>). _M. abscessus_ pulmonary infections can be severe and especially difficult to treat because of the resistance of _M. abscessus_ to many antibiotics.The few drugs that have in vitro activity against _M. abscessus_ include clarithromycin, azithromycin, aminoglycosides, cefoxitin, tigecycline, and imipenem. Recommendations are to combine clarithromycin with at least one other drug, such as an aminoglycoside (usually amikacin) or perhaps one other injectable drug such as cefoxitin or imipenem, depending on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (<http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/30/jac.dkr578.full>).The total duration of therapy usually recommended is 6 to 12 or more months (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/12/1756.full>). Localized disease typically responds to 6 months of therapy in immunocompetent hosts, and lung or disseminated infections can require over 6 months of therapy. Surgical resection in patients with areas of focal severe bronchiectasis and/or cavitary pulmonary disease, aimed at decreasing the mycobacterial load and removing a reservoir of infection, when combined with multidrug antibiotic therapy, has been reported to result in more prolonged microbiologic responses (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/565.long>).A previous ProMED-mail post reported on another organism, _Legionella pneumophila_, that contaminated dental water lines and caused infection after dental procedures. In that case, genetic sequencing found that _L. pneumophila_ in the water lines matched the organisms that caused legionnaires' disease (Legionellosis - Italy: (Rome) dental exposure 20120218.1045716). This report postulated that ""aerosolized water from high speed turbine instruments was most likely the source of the [lung] infection,"" likely as a result of inhalation of aerosolized of legionella or aspiration. Significant contamination of dental unit waterlines with legionella has been widely documented (Williams JF, Molinari JA, Andrews N. Microbial contamination of dental unit waterlines: origins and characteristics. Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry 1996; 17:538-540; Pankhurst CL, Philpott-Howard JN, Hewitt JH, Casewell MW. The efficacy of chlorination and filtration in the control and eradication of Legionella from dental chair water systems. Journal of Hospital Infections 1990: 16(1):9-18). Serological studies have also shown a higher prevalence of antibodies to _L. pneumophila_ in dentists and dental practice staff, suggesting a potential health risk for dental workers (Pankhurst CL et al. Prevalence of legionella waterline contamination and _Legionella pneumophila_ antibodies in general dental practitioners in London and rural Northern Ireland. British Dental Journal 2003; 195(10):591-594). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
