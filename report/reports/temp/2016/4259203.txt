Fox News [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/06/01/new-orleans-woman-contracts-flesh-eating-bacteria-while-fishing.html>While fishing in the Gulf of Mexico in mid-May 2016, a New Orleans woman contracted an infection with _Vibrio vulnificus_. Now, health officials are issuing a word of caution for those going to the beach off the coast of Louisiana.The woman was beach surf fishing when she stepped into the mouth of a fish on 12 May 2016, WDSU reported. She cleaned the 2 small scratches, went to the hospital the next day and started taking antimicrobials. ""A week later, my foot was still huge and I'm starting to have dead tissue around my foot so I'm just worried,"" she told WDSU. The scratches became a deep, wide wound, and she required surgery to remove dead tissue and receive a skin graft.""If you have an open wound and you go into the salt water off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf, you can be exposed to _Vibrio vulnificus_. The other way is by eating raw oysters,"" Dr. Obinna Nnedu, Blomberg's infectious disease doctor at Ochsner Medical Center, told the news channel._Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause necrotizing fasciitis [sometimes called flesh-eating disease] that might spread within 4 to 6 hours, and symptoms include redness, swelling and high fever. Symptoms are worse for those with weak immune systems, high amounts of iron in their body and liver disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.""The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. It is not clear that the woman in this post had any well defined risk factors. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/221>.]
