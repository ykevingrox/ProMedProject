Tens of thousands of people are at risk of catching Bairnsdale ulcer with doctors left baffled over where it comes from.The gruesome flesh-eating bug has been around for decades but its prevalence in the country is growing, with parts of Victoria and Queensland already hit hard and warnings that New South Wales could be next.It is believed it could be spread by mosquito bites or even through possums after they have been bitten by the insect. The disease 1st starts out looking like any normal mosquito bite, but months later, a volcano-like wound will develop and start eating through the flesh. If picked up early, the 1st line of treatment is to cut away the dead skin or to use oral or intravenous antibiotics. But if left untreated, the bite can develop and force its victims to need extensive surgery and be left with extreme scarring. Others are even forced to have limbs amputated.The aggressive bug can be transmitted from person to person as soon as they step into one of the hotspots. Earlier this month [August 2016], it was reported the bug had spread to the Melbourne suburbs of Bentleigh, Hampton and Cheltenham, southeast of the CBD [central business district].Austin Health infectious diseases physician and medical researcher Professor Paul Johnson said the bug should not be ignored. He said more research needed to be done into the spread of the disease to stop it seeping into other states. Prof Johnson said there was a Bairnsdale ulcer outbreak in the Mornington and Bellarine peninsulas in recent decades but it had since spread to Frankston, an outer-southeastern suburb of Melbourne, and even some southern parts of NSW (New South Wales). Prof Johnson said he couldn't understand why it was not there already, considering parts of the state had the same climate as suburbs in Melbourne that were hot spots for the flesh-eating bug.""There have been some cases near the Victorian border, and it could creep up from there,"" he said. Prof Johnson said the Bairnsdale ulcer was very unpredictable and quickly changed its path, much like migrating birds. ""In Victoria, it moved progressively west but stopped at Torquay. Now it's moving back to the east,"" he said. Prof Johnson believed mosquitoes were carrying the bug and transmitting it to people through their bites. ""We still don't know a lot about where it's coming from,"" he said. ""One current theory is that maybe it's spreading in possums and somehow humans get infections indirectly. Maybe they are getting it from possums via mosquitoes. But maybe possums are just victims of it, like humans.""The Bairnsdale ulcer, also known at the Buruli ulcer, can also affect bones if it worsens. Prof Johnson said in rare cases the ulcer could also cause gangrene, the death and decomposition of body tissue.There have been cases in other countries, predominantly in Nigeria, Mali and other west African countries. Australia is the only developed country with significant Bairnsdale ulcer outbreaks. The number of cases has almost doubled in the past 3 years. In 2015, there were 106 cases recorded in Victoria, up from the 65 in 2013. There have already been 45 cases recorded this year [2016] in Victoria alone.In a health warning from Victoria Health this month [August 2016], chief health officer Professor Charles Guest said the bug remained a ""concern"" in the state. The warning states that everyone is susceptible to the infection.There has also been a number of people infected by the flesh-eating bug in far-north Queensland near Mossman and on the Capricorn Coast of Queensland near Yeppoon. The tropical north coast near Darwin has also suffered an outbreak. Prof Johnson said last year [2015] there were only about 3 cases in Queensland, but the state suffered from a massive outbreak in 2011. ""Queensland may have none [or] very few cases, but every now and then there will be an outbreak, likely occurring in the Mossman area,"" Prof Johnson said.He said it mainly affected healthy people from the very young to the old. ""It's not a disease of the sick and weak,"" Prof Johnson said. The Bairnsdale ulcer often erupts on the elbow, back, calf or ankle about 4 months after a person has been bitten. The incubation process is slow, and it's likely transmitted while people are in tropical and coastal climates.""We still don't understand why people get it and exactly how to stop it, and how to stop it moving around,"" Prof Johnson said. ""It starts as something strange and innocuous but it gradually gets bigger and looks like a small volcano on your skin. ""It gradually swells and hollows out and discharges.""Holidaymakers have been among those who have found the Bairnsdale ulcer lurking beneath their skin. The bug eats through healthy cells, gnawing through skin, nerve, blood and fat cells.Prof Johnson said doctors in NSW were yet to deal with many Bairnsdale ulcer cases and encouraged anybody concerned to talk to their health professional.The chief health officer of Victoria said the bug was 1st diagnosed in the Bairnsdale area in the 1930s and, since 2012, areas on the Mornington Peninsula, particularly Rye and surrounding townships, had seen a growing number of cases.Professor Guest said wearing appropriate, protective clothing when gardening and undertaking recreational activities in areas with the Bairnsdale ulcer would prevent infection. Cuts and abrasions should also be cleaned promptly, and exposed skin contaminated by suspect soil or water should be washed following outdoor activities. Professor Guest said people should also protect themselves with insect repellent.[Byline: Olivia Lambert]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[The following has been mostly extracted from World Health Organization Buruli ulcer fact sheet no 199 (updated July 2014), available at <http://www.who.int/entity/mediacentre/factsheets/fs199/en/index.html>:Buruli ulcer (also known as the Bairnsdale ulcer) is a chronic debilitating skin and soft tissue infection with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms that can lead to bone infection and permanent disfigurement and disability. It initially presents as a nodule or large painless area of induration or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms or face.It is caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, which needs a temperature between 29-33 C [84.2-91.4 F] and a low (2.5 per cent) oxygen concentration to grow in vitro. Reduced oxygen tension enhances the growth of _M. ulcerans_, suggesting that this organism has a preference for microaerobic environments (<http://jcm.asm.org/content/36/11/3420.full>). The organism produces a unique toxin -- mycolactone -- which causes tissue damage and inhibits the immune response. Local immunosuppressive properties of the mycolactone toxin enable the disease to progress with no pain and fever. The diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture.Buruli ulcer has been reported in over 30 countries, usually with subtropical and temperate climates, in Africa, South America, Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Countries in West and Central Africa -- Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana -- report the majority of cases. In Africa, about 48 per cent of those affected are children under 15 years, whereas in Australia, 10 per cent are children under 15 years, and in Japan, 19 per cent are children under 15 years. 80 per cent of cases detected early can be cured with a combination of antibiotics; however, late diagnosis can result in long and costly hospitalizations with significant morbidity and disability.Different combinations of antibiotics given for 8 weeks are used to treat the Buruli ulcer irrespective of the stage. Medical treatment is rifampin, combined with either streptomycin or clarithromycin, for 8 weeks, in addition to surgical wound management. Rifampin combined with moxifloxacin has also been used.Buruli ulcer is named after a county in Uganda. Although the exact mode of transmission of _M. ulcerans_ is still unknown, _M. ulcerans_ is thought to be acquired from the environment, and this organism has been found in the feces of possums in Buruli ulcer-endemic areas of Victoria, Australia (ProMED-mail post Buruli ulcer - Australia: (VI) M. ulcerans, possum feces 20140913.2771412), where mosquitoes may be vectors (Lavender CJ, Fyfe JA, Azuolas J, et al: Risk of Buruli ulcer and detection of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ in mosquitoes in south eastern Australia. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2011; 5(9): e1305. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001305. Epub 2011 Sep 20). _M. ulcerans_ is not thought to be transmitted person-to-person (ProMED-mail post Buruli ulcer - Liberia (02): (BG) comment, RFI 20141028.2908743).
