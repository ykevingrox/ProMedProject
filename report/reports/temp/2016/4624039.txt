Times of India, Times News Network (TNN) [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Seasons-first-KFD-case-in-Valpoi/articleshow/55361296.cms>A case of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey disease, was detected in Valpoi last week.An elderly woman tested positive for the fever and was hospitalized for a brief period. ""The patient is doing well,"" state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, said. KFD was 1st detected in Sattari taluka in 2015. Some cases were also detected in the Bethora taluka earlier this year [2016]. Three people have died of KFD, and 277 cases have been reported since then.Though the directorate of health services (DHS) undertook a vaccination programme in 2 talukas to control the infection, and many were vaccinated, the DHS faces some problems with the programme. Vaccine doses are spread over a period of 5 years, and many don't turn up for subsequent doses after the initial 1-2 doses.Betodkar said they have started issuing cards to people mentioning the dates on which they have to report to the health facility for the next vaccine dose. The effort does not seem to have yielded the expected result, and Betodkar said that though people come forward to get vaccinated in the initial rounds, many don't turn up for subsequent rounds of vaccination. ""We will continue our propaganda to make people aware about the danger of KFD,"" Betodkar said.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The KFD virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ and family _Flaviviridae_. It was 1st recognized in 1957, when an illness occurred concomitantly in monkeys (_Semnopithecus entellus_ and _Macaca radiata_) and in humans (<http://www.searo.who.int/publications/journals/seajph/seajphv3n1p8.pdf>).Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), a tickborne viral hemorrhagic fever, is endemic in 5 districts of Karnataka state, India. There are recent reports of the spread of disease to neighbouring districts of the Western Ghats mountain range, namely Chamarajanagar district in Karnataka, Nilgiri district in Tamil Nadu, Wayanad and Malappuram districts in Kerala, and Pali village in Goa <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545326/>.As per the media report above, an elderly woman has tested positive for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) in the Valpoi city of Sattari, sub-district of North Goa. The talukas in this region 1st reported cases last year [2015], and there have been 277 cases in the current year [2016] with 3 deaths.KFD typically occurs during the dry season, from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of nymphs of the ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection. In particular, herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are at increased risk of contracting the disease. In order to prevent KFD in the local population, it is necessary to create awareness in the community on protection from tick bites and ensure availability of KFD vaccination in the affected areas. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are key to prevent KFD. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/301>.]
