BBC News [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36223918>Pakistani police say the brother of a sweet-shop owner poisoned a batch of sweets that killed more than 30 people last month [April 2016].The brother confessed to mixing pesticide into the sweets after a family dispute, police told the BBC.However, correspondents say there is confusion over what happened, because 2 other people have also told police that they poisoned the sweets.The contaminated sweets had affected over 70 people in Punjab province.Among those who died were 11 members of the same family who had bought the laddoos -- ball-shaped sweets popular at special occasions -- to celebrate the birth of a son.Acting district police officer Ramiz Bokhari told the BBC that the 18-year-old brother of shop owner Tariq Mahmood had admitted to mixing pesticides in the sweets.""He told police his elder brother used to beat and abuse him,"" Mr Bokhari said, adding that the teenager had done it ""in anger and revenge"".However, the owner of a nearby pesticide shop also told police that he poisoned the laddoos following a dispute he had with the sweet-shop owner. A worker at the sweet shop told police he had mixed in the pesticides by mistake.Correspondents say the 3 conflicting statements have raised questions about police tactics and the value of confessions.Rights groups have previously accused the Pakistani authorities of forcing confessions from suspects.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Well, it seems that an analysis of the laddoos will determine which pesticide(s) were involved in the poisoning. Unless all the confessors used the same pesticide, then it would be easy to determine who is telling the truth. Or perhaps there are 3 pesticides and perhaps all 3 are telling the truth.A mixture of pesticides may explain why death was so rapid.We look forward to the results of the analysis of the sweets. - Mod.TG][Thank you to an EpiCore member who contributed a similar report. - Mod.LMA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/941>.]
