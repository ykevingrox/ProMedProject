The state had experienced 38 mosquito-borne virus cases and in one of those a person died. The recently reported case is a confirmed laboratory case. The virus can occur at any time of the year, but peaks in a period from July through September.According to Health Department, the symptoms in those infected with West Nile virus are usually mild and may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, a rash, muscle weakness, or swollen lymph nodes. In a minority of cases, infection can result in encephalitis or meningitis, which can lead to paralysis, coma, and possibly death.The Health Ministry advises people to take prevention measures to avoid getting infected by mosquitoes. They are recommended to dry up or to report authorities about standing water sites. Windows should be covered with screens and use of anti-mosquito products be made. People should wear long-sleeved, light clothing in areas with the bugs, especially if they are outdoors the entire day.Authorities said the best way to prevent the spread of West Nile is to eliminate the breeding ground for mosquitoes and their habitats. The signs and symptoms of West Nile are similar to those of the flu. Those most susceptible to the virus are the elderly, young, and those with compromised immune systems.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Mississippi can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2427>.
