Officials said [the woman] was vomiting blood and had high fever and tests conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital confirmed she was suffering from Congo fever. Her death came a day after a 36-year-old butcher died of Congo fever at the JPMC. The [36-year-old man] who passed away on [Sat 1 Oct 2016], was a resident of Baldia Town who had been admitted to the JPMC on late Thursday night [29 Sep 2016].A polymerase chain reaction test had confirmed that he was suffering from Congo fever. Dr Javed Jamali, the JPMC deputy director, told The News that [the man] died in the afternoon. ""CCHF is a highly lethal disease with a rate of over 50 percent mortality. So far no cure except symptomatic treatment is available for infected patients. The best option available is prevention,"" Dr Atif Hafeez, president of the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) said.He, however, expressed concern over such a large number of CCHF cases reported from the entire country this year [2016], especially in Karachi. He asked the government to initiate an epidemiological study on rising cases of lethal viral diseases including Congo fever. The deadly tick-borne disease is contracted through cattle and other animals as the parasite attaches itself onto the human skin.[Byline: M Waqar Bhatti]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above mentions the most recent fatal case of CCHF, as well as some cases that have been reported in previous posts. The last sentence in the report can be misleading as the disease is essentially spread through direct contact with blood or body fluids from infected animals and human cases as well as through bites from infected ticks. - Mod.UBAMaps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/947>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
