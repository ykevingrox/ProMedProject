Lubumbashi is the 2nd largest city of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The outbreak of the epidemic has been linked to poor hygiene in some municipalities.Health officials are still to give a clear figure of the number of deaths recorded so far and are looking for ways to stop the spread of the disease by creating more awareness on hygienic measures. For now a center specialized in the treatment of cholera has been opened to help in the handling of serious cases. The local Red Cross has been distributing products used for water treatment.A press release from the office for the coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Lubumbashi indicates that the treatment centre has benefited from 30 beds as part of aid from a non-governmental organization.The donation is expected to increase the capacity of the center as the number of patients increase everyday.[Byline: Elvis Boh]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail by HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Lubumbashi, in the southeastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo, is the 2nd-largest city in the country, after the capital Kinshasa. Lubumbashi is the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, acting as a hub for many of the country's biggest mining companies. The copper-mining city serves as the capital of the relatively prosperous Katanga Province, lying near the border with Zambia.

In a public notice signed by the Deputy Health Minister, Dr. Victor Bampoe, the Ministry said some communities are still inundated with risk factors that promote the spread of cholera, hence the need for strict sanitary practices.""This correspondence is to formally notify all and serve as a reminder that, as the rains have set in, and some cities and towns might have experienced flooding, together with other existing risk factors, the potential and tendency for recurrence of cholera outbreak is very high,"" the notice stated. The notice said other risk factors include ""intense population movements, inadequate supply of safe water, poor food and personal hygiene practices"". Cholera claimed over 200 lives about 2 years ago, which led to the introduction of the National Sanitation Day exercise. The number of recorded cases and deaths has only reduced slightly. In 2014, Greater Accra Region alone recorded 28 975 cholera cases with 243 deaths. But the number of cases reduced drastically in 2015 to 692 with 15 deaths. The Public Relations Officer of the Health Ministry, Tony Goodman, who spoke to Citi News on the alert, indicated that there was no cause for alarm yet, as there was only one case of cholera recorded at the Achimota Hospital. He, however, noted that the Ministry of Health is embarking on a sensitization drive to aid in the prevention and spread of the disease. ""If our campaign together with the media is taken seriously, we are not supposed to see what we saw in 2015 and 2014; so we entreat you the media to keep drumming that message of cleaning our environment, keeping ourselves clean, washing our hands and all that."" He assured that the health facilities are ready to deal with an outbreak, but reiterated the fact that prevention is their priority.

County health chief officer Hassan Komoro said the children died in Dida Ade Village on the outskirts of Garsen Town.The children died on Tuesday, 12 Apr 2016, while undergoing treatment, a day after a middle-aged woman succumbed to the illness at Garsen Health Centre where she had been admitted. A man died at Witu Health Centre, Mr Komoro confirmed.Tana Delta Sub-County Medical Officer of Health Nicholas Mwenda said several children were among people admitted to Garsen Health Centre with severe diarrhea and vomiting. Dr Mwenda said 2 children had died. One of them had been diagnosed with cholera but the medics were yet to establish the cause of death of the other child. ""We expect a comprehensive report after further laboratory analysis and our team on the ground is managing the situation well,"" he added.Public health officers have been put on high alert and have been instructed to promote public awareness and surveillance around the county to stop the spread of the disease. ""We are considering closing down all restaurants and ban vending of food in public places, especially to travellers who pass through our trading centres,"" said Mr Komoro. He said this would ensure the disease does not spread to neighbouring Kilifi, Garissa and Lamu counties through travelers between Mombasa and Garissa via Garsen and Mombasa and to Lamu via Minjila.Mr Komoro said cholera first broke out the Kipini Village last month [March 2016], where 80 people were taken ill. ""All of them received instant treatment at the health centre, but our team remain vigilant because of fear the disease might still spread,"" he added.The officers have linked the cholera to fish that was brought into the village by fishermen from Pemba. ""Cholera started when the Pemba fishermen landed there and sold fish to locals,"" said the county health chief officer.[Byline: Galgalo Bocha]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Tana River County is a county in the former Coast Province, Kenya and can be found on a map at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tana_River_County>. - Mod.LL]******[4] Cholera - Malawi (Central Region)Date: Wed 13 Apr 2016Source: AllAfrica, Malawi News Agency report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201604131446.html>Salima District Hospital has confirmed that one person, aged 49, has died from cholera while another one is in serious condition. Speaking with Mana on Friday morning [8 Apr 2016], District Environmental Health Officer (DEHO) Temwa Mzengeza said that the deceased passed on in the early hours of Friday, 8 Apr 2016.""The deceased was at first admitted as diarrhea patient, later samples were taken for cholera testing after it was noted that her guardian had also started showing signs of diarrhea,"" said Mzengeza.""We got the results yesterday [12 Apr 2016] and immediately all measures were taken to treat the patients and to stop any further spread, unfortunately the one who was responding well to the treatment is the one who has died,"" said Mzengeza.According to the Co-coordinator for Water Sanitation and Health (WASH) Waki Chungwa, surveillance has shown that all households within William village have toilets, but the only challenge is that they do not have a safe water point. ""The people have reported that they get there water from an open well, so despite the fact that they have toilets we cannot rule out cases of open defecation,"" said Chungwa.[Byline: Watson Maingo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Salima is a township in the Central Region of Malawi and can be found on a map at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salima_(township)>. - Mod.LL]******[5] Cholera - Malawi (Northern Region)Date: Tue 12 Apr 2016Source: Capital Radio Malawi [edited]<http://www.capitalradiomalawi.com/news/item/6074-authorities-in-malawi-troubled-with-increased-cholera-cases>Authorities in Malawi Troubled with Increased Cholera Cases-----------------------------------------------------------Health officials in Malawi have expressed worry over the startling increase of cholera cases in Karonga district, some 555 km [about 345 miles] north of the capital, Lilongwe. The District Environmental Health Officer (DEHO) of Karonga has told Capital FM that cholera cases in the northern region district are increasingly becoming unbearable considering the number that has been registered within a period of 3 months from late December 2015 to the end of January 2016.Lewis Tukula described cholera outbreak in the district as a big challenge to the lives of many people prior to a total of 29 cases which was flagged by 11 Apr 2016 within the areas of Traditional Authorities (T/As) Mwakaboko and Kilipula.""You can imagine the situation, as I am talking now out of these 29 cases, 3 people have died already. The death toll is just too high because wherever life gets eliminated, it becomes a big problem not only to the family but also to the nation.""The DEHO further explained that during the onset of the outbreak in January [2016] in Karonga North, the areas of the T/As Mwakaboko and Kilipula were the most highly affected. ""By then, these cases were registered at Iponga, Kapolo and Atupele health centres but also at the end of January it was found that there was one case from Tanzania which was admitted at Karonga district hospital.""""This is where all this problem developed from as these nomadic fishermen sometimes are found in the villages of Kafikisila, Mwahimba, Shemu and Malema 1 who have made all villages surrounding Karonga township be affected with the outbreak.""During the time this reporter got in touch with the DEHO, 3 people were battling for their life at the Karonga district hospital while 3 others were admitted at Lupembe, Nyungwe and Kapolo health centres, respectively.Furthermore, Tukula said limited cholera treatment resources like oral rehydration salts (ORS), IV cannula face masks and cotton remain the outstanding challenge towards the prevention of the outbreak.""We also encourage the use of chlorine though it is expensive for government to procure which is needed for the people in every 2 weeks. This requires about 60 drums of 25 litres of chlorine but currently we only have about 25 drums which will run down anytime.""He however encouraged communities to promote personal hygiene like washing hands after visiting the toilet, before and after eating, refraining from eating salads, and any kind of foodstuffs at the funeral and/or bathing the corpse of a person who dies of cholera, just to mention but a few.Karonga district was last hit by cholera in 2002 where hundreds of people died of the epidemic.[Byline: Nobert Mzembe]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org> [Karonga is a district in the Northern Region of Malawi and can be seen on a map at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karonga_District>. - Mod.LL]******[6] Cholera - Kuwait ex IraqDate: Thu 14 Apr 2016Source: Arab Times [edited]<http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/kuwait-records-5-cases-cholera-victims-came-iraq/>Assistant Undersecretary for Public Health Affairs at Ministry of Health Dr Majdah Al-Qattan revealed that Kuwait recorded 5 cases of cholera in people who came from Iraq and they have been treated. On the sidelines of the inaugural ceremony of the Scientific Conference on Latest Surgeries for Breast and Kidney Cancers, Dr Al-Qattan affirmed that the precautionary measures taken so far for preventing the spread of cholera in the country are being closely monitored to complement the previous steps.She said it was decided during that meeting of the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] Epidemic Committee last month [March 2016] that the GCC member states must take proactive steps to prevent incursion and spread of cholera, indicating that this is the reason why the Customs officers have been screening travelers from Iraq and other affected countries.Dr Al-Qattan revealed that the import of food items from these countries has also been banned till further notice. She stressed the ministry's keenness to bring new vaccines for the disease and take all necessary steps in that regard, stating that the Higher Committee on Vaccination follows certain procedures with the concerned companies and storage facilities for approving the import of new vaccines.[Byline: Marwa Al-Bahrawi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing Kuwait and Iraq is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/129>.The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
