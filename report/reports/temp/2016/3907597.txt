FitNHit [edited]<http://fitnhit.com/news/905-people-lost-lives-due-swine-flu-h1n1-maharashtra-2015/51955/>Swine Flu (H1N1): The dreadful H1N1 infection (Swine Flu) resulted in the death of 905 people in Maharashtra in 2015. This number is 35 percent higher than the number in 2011 when the infection was at its peak. 8583 cases of swine flu have been reported by the state in 2015. This clearly indicates that the mortality rate was more than 10 percent.""Maharashtra has reported high mortality, but it could be because of a robust surveillance system. We are recording all cases of swine flu in the state,"" said Dr Pardeep Awate, in charge of swine flu programme in the state.Only 30 000 people in Maharashtra have taken the vaccination whereas 1 lakh [100 000 doses of] vaccine have been procured by the state government in August [2015]. Going by the state government's Communicable Disease Committee set up, the mortality rate was witnessed higher among pregnant women, diabetic patients and people with hypertension.As such, a free vaccination programme was also initiated by the state health department in August [2015] for pregnant women. Later in December [2015], it was extended to the diabetic patients and people with hypertension. The government officials have denied the reports of mutation of the H1N1 virus.  ""It is now beyond doubt that the virus has mutated."" [sic, this seems to contradict the previous sentence; but see moderator comment below. - Mod.JW].  ""In the past 5 years, we have observed a cyclic pattern, wherein the infection gradually declines after a rise, like what was seen in 2015,"" said Dr Awate 70 people were killed in Mumbai due to H1N1 infection during 2015. It has been revealed by the doctors that the number of cases has come down in the city in December [2015]. However, an increasing number of H1N1 cases and deaths have been reported in other places like Nagpur, Nashik and Pune in the same month.[Byline: Archana Kabra]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail  and Healthmap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[H1N1 influenza is actually a seasonal influenza, as discussed repeatedly in ProMed mail postings. Although the media regularly refer to the virus as ""swine flu"", the term is misleading. An informative source on H1N1 can be found at <http://www.flu.gov/about_the_flu/h1n1/>.   The disease is preventable as the virus is included in the human vaccine.  The issue of mutation of H1N1 is raised in this report. In May 2015, _The Disease Daily_ [<http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/h1n1-mutates-india-32215> ] suggested mutation of H1N1 had occurred in India:According to researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), samples of the H1N1 swine flu strain currently ravaging India indicate that the strain may have mutated to become more infectious and dangerous [1]. As of 15 March [2015], the country's Ministry of Health estimates there to be 29 938 cases of swine flu across India, resulting in 1731 deaths [2]. These figures surpass the country's H1N1 numbers from the 2009 pandemic, in which 27 236 cases and 981 deaths were reported [2].Published earlier this month in an issue of _Cell Host and Microbe_, researchers Kannan Tharakaraman and Ram Sasisekharanan suggest that an evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein -- which encompasses ""receptor binding, fusion, and transmission properties"" -- has taken place, resulting in a more virulent strain of the pandemic H1N1 virus, as well as increased disease severity among current flu cases in India [1]. This is because 1 of the specific mutations can be linked to ""increased severity of the disease, while another enhances its infectiousness"" [4]. The mutations, alongside ideal environmental conditions such as high population density -- allowing for easier transmission -- has permitted the virus to become entrenched within the population [3]. According to Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious disease physician from the University of Florida, a majority of Indians do not get their flu vaccinations either [5].What's often concerning about this strain of swine flu in particular is its tendency to target young adults [5]. While flu typically strikes children and elderly populations the hardest, this year's H1N1 strain has shown to impact young adults the most. This is the same infection pattern as the 2009 and 1918 H1N1 pandemics [5]. In their commentary, Tharakaraman and Sasisekharana call for increased influenza surveillance and monitoring, to allow for further examination of the mutation of the influenza virus and its implications [3].Contrary to the recently published research on the topic, India's National Institute of Virology claims that the swine flu virus strain currently causing the outbreak in the country is the same strain from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and that the strain has not mutated [1].

According to Michael Coston, Editor of Avian Flu diary [<http://afludiary.blogspot.com/>], their hosting company - Linode - has been under a massive coordinated cyber attack since early yesterday, and that this is just the latest in a series of attacks which began Christmas day.  This attack affects far more than just FluTrackers.... Linode's data centers in Atlanta, Dallas, Newark and London have all been affected, although only Atlanta remains down.  Cyber security presents a serious challenge on many levels. Maharashtra is a state in the western region of India and is the nation's 3rd largest state and is also the world's 2nd-most populous sub-national entity. It has over 110 million inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai [formerly Bombay], has a population of approximately 18 million. Maharashtra is among the wealthiest and the most developed states in India. from Wikipedia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra>)A map of India may be accessed at <http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/in.htm> - Mod.LK]
