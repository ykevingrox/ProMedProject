At least 137 people have gotten seriously ill after they consumed toxic milk from a shop in Muradabad, which is near Faisalabad.According to sources, a new shop had opened up in the district of Muradabad and the owner of the shop gave out free milk-soda bottles to all the people who were attending the inauguration. Not long after consuming the beverage, people started feeling sick.Shortly after, more than 100 people were rushed to the Allied Hospital and the General Hospital. According to the doctors, all of the patients who were brought in, had fallen ill due to the milk-soda which they consumed. Out of all the people, 80 of them were young children. At least 67 people are still admitted at the hospital-out of which 10 are said to be in critical condition.The owner of the shop has been arrested and investigations are going on. The shop owner also identified the factory from where he bought the soda bottles and its owner has been arrested as well.DCO [district coordination officer] Salman Ghani told reporters that both the shop and the soda factory have been sealed and samples of milk-soda have been sent to the laboratory for testing.Health and safety standards are very low in Pakistan and especially in rural areas, where there are no checks performed at food outlets and factories. Last month [April 2016], more than 25 people [now 33 - Mod.TG] were killed after consuming poisonous sweets in Layyah.[Byline: Fatima Arshad]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Milk soda is beverage made with milk and cola, having the industry standardized ratio of 1:1 of either ingredient (that is, 50 percent milk and 50 percent cola). The exact origin of this beverage is unknown, but many scholars speculate that the pioneer of this creation was likely of Pakistani or Indian decent.There are not enough details provided to understand if this could be spoiled milk or perhaps some chemical in this drink. Clearly more investigation and information are needed.Portions of this comment were extracted from <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dodh+soda>. - Mod.TG].................................................sb/tg/mj/lm"
