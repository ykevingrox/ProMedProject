However, it is far to soon to relax, with campaigns getting underway in several municipalities. As long as there is ongoing transmission, there is reason for serious concern and continued action, not only for Angola, but also for neighboring DR Congo and beyond.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Angola can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY]
