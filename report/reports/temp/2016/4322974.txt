US CDC developed an RT-PCR and ELISA for IgM and IgG for Sosuga virus after the single case of a VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever]-like illness in a US wildlife biologist in 2012. I do not know if the laboratories in Uganda, Senegal, and South Africa that tested samples from the outbreak in South Sudan have these assays for Sosuga. The lab results for 10 viruses reported in the 25 Jun [2016] Lancet commentary, and 19 May [2016] WHO Disease Outbreak News, did not include Sosuga. In 2015 Sosuga was reported in the wide-ranging Sub-Saharan Egyptian rousette bats in several locations in Uganda. So at this late point still without an explanation (viral, non-viral, or non-infectious) it seems warranted to include testing for Sosuga.--Daniel Lucey, MD, MPHGeorgetown University Medical and Law CentersProMED-mail consultant for Middle East (MENA) and South Asia<daniel.lucey8@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Dr. Lucey for his comments. Apparently, Sosuga virus had not been included in tests done on the individuals involved in the hemorrhagic fever outbreak in South Sudan, and one hopes that samples from the 52 suspected cases and 10 deaths are still available for further testing.The possibility of Sosuga virus as the etiological agent raises some interesting epidemiological questions. If fruit bats are the main reservoir of the virus and source of human infection, it seems odd that the 52 suspected cases would be exposed to these bats, and infected, and become ill within a relatively short period of time. Perhaps the bats shed virus and contaminate a common source of food or drink for the community, similar to the situation with Nipah virus and fruit bats in Bangladesh. Another possibility is person-to-person transmission, although health officials indicate that there is no evidence for that.References:AlbariÌ±o CG, Foltzer M, Towner JS, Rowe LA, Campbell S, Jaramillo CM, et al.

She was hospitalized, after which a maculopapular rash developed and became confluent. When the patient was discharged from the hospital on day 14, arthralgia and myalgia had improved, oropharynx ulcerations had healed, the rash had resolved without desquamation, and blood counts and hepatic enzyme levels were returning to reference levels. After several known suspect pathogens were ruled out as the cause of her illness, deep sequencing and metagenomics analysis revealed a novel paramyxovirus related to rubula-like viruses isolated from fruit bats.Mortlock M, Kuzmin IV, Weyer J, Gilbert AT, Agwanda B, Rupprecht CE, et al.

Phylogenetic analysis supports the presence of at least 2 major viral lineages and suggests that paramyxoviruses are strongly associated with several bat genera.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of South Sudan can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402>.][See Also:Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan 20160519.42334202015----Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (07): (Darfur) comment 20151208.3849227Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (06): (Darfur) RFI 20151207.3844646Undiagnosed outbreak - Sudan (05): (ND) fever, rash, refugee camp, children, RFI 20151110.37809162014----Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (07): (ND, SK) dengue susp, RFI 20141201.3001675Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (03): (SF) displaced persons, RFI 20141101.2921031].................................................ty/je/ml"
