Vox [edited]<http://www.vox.com/2016/3/22/11278908/elizabthkingia-virus-symptoms>Since last November [2015], more than 50 people in Wisconsin have been sickened by mysterious bacteria called _Elizabethkingia anophelis_. This is the largest recorded outbreak caused by what's to date been a rare microbe -- and the same bug was identified last week in a patient who died in Michigan. Public health officials in both states don't yet know what sparked the outbreaks or how people became infected, but they're worried. So far, 18 people have died from the infection, and researchers believe this particular strain is resistant to many of the antimicrobials that could stop it.There's another problem: There's a lot the research community has yet to learn about elizabethkingia and its effects on people. I spoke to one of the few researchers -- Michigan State University microbiologist Dr Shicheng Chen -- who's studied the species that's sickening people in the USA. Here are 5 facts to know.1. The bacteria were only discovered in 2011.Elizabethkingia is a type of bacteria named for Elizabeth O King, a bacteriologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] who discovered the 1st species of this genus in the 1950s. Since then, researchers have found several related bacteria. The one that's involved in this outbreak is _Elizabethkingia anophelis_, which was isolated from anopheles mosquitoes in 2011.2. The bacteria are everywhere, but they don't sicken everyone.Dr Chen explained that these bacteria are common -- found in soil, water, and insects -- and only rarely seem to bother humans. Typically, the people who get sick are the very young, the elderly, or those with underlying health conditions. And that's exactly what seems to be playing out currently. In Wisconsin's outbreak, which has been going on since November 2015, 54 people have been infected and 17 have died. Most of the patients who were diagnosed with the bug were over the age of 65 (the median age is 77). All of those infected had a history of at least one underlying serious illness that compromised their immune systems.In Michigan, the Department of Health and Human Services said the patient who was infected with elizabethkingia -- and who later died -- was an older adult with underlying health problems.3. Elizabethkingia can kill.In all these cases, it's unclear whether the bacterium caused or contributed to the deaths. But elizabethkingia can be deadly. Chen said the death rate from this bacteria is usually around 20 per cent (though some outbreaks have killed more than half of those infected). Again, though, most outbreaks to date have been a lot smaller than the one we're seeing in the Midwest. Depending on how the microbe infects people, sickness can look quite varied. _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ can cause infections of the blood, leading to sepsis and septic shock. It can also attack the respiratory tract, causing lung infections and difficulty breathing, or even infect the skin, causing rashes and swelling. Both _E. meningoseptica_ and _E. anophelis_ are associated with infant meningitis, which researchers think can be passed on from mothers to babies.For most healthy people, however, the bacterium doesn't seem to be much of a problem. ""It's just some patients -- especially those who are old, normally around [over? - Mod.SH] 55, or who are immunocompromised -- who have trouble,"" said Chen.4. Researchers don't know exactly what's causing these outbreaks.In both Michigan and Wisconsin, the source of infection is unknown, and health officials aren't sure of how it spread. This isn't entirely surprising, Chen said, considering researchers don't know exactly how _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ is transmitted. ""We are looking at many possible sources and have not ruled anything out definitely at this point,"" said Julie Lund, communications director at Wisconsin's health department, ""but we are reasonably certain that groundwater is not the source."" CDC is also helping Wisconsin with testing of samples, including health care products, water sources, and the environment. ""To date, none of these have been found to be a source of the bacterium.""5. The bacteria seem to be resistant to antimicrobials and disinfectants.""Our studies show that elizabethkingia acquired some antimicrobial-resistant genes that we originally thought were not supposed to be there,"" said Chen. ""That means it is quickly adapting to antimicrobials."" For now, Chen said, it's not clear whether the bacteria are more resistant and spreading more quickly, whether we're just better at tracking it, or both.""Because it's understudied, there's a lot we don't know about elizabethkingia,"" Chen explained. Researchers only recently developed testing that allowed them to differentiate among _Elizabethkingia_ species, so the improved detection may be why this bug seems to be popping up more. But Chen suspects we'll be hearing more about this bacterium as both detection -- and, potentially, drug resistance -- get stronger.[byline: Julia Belluz]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[I was able to find out some information about the Michigan case, which occurred in the lower peninsula of the state, nowhere near Wisconsin, and it is not clear if the patient, who had significant co-morbidities, had travelled recently to Wisconsin or had any contact with products from there. The culture was originally obtained on 24 Feb 2016.The next weekly Wisconsin state report should be available tomorrow, 23 Mar 2016.As a reminder regarding antimicrobial sensitivities of the outbreak strain (from Wisconsin Department of Health Services, For Health Professionals <https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/elizabethkingia.htm>: Although elizabethkingia are multidrug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) conducted at Wisconsin clinical microbiology laboratories of recent isolates of elizabethkingia demonstrated most of the isolates tested are susceptible to fluoroquinolones, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. AST (MIC [minimum inhibitory concentration] testing) and characterization of strains has been conducted at CDC on 9 isolates of elizabethkingia from blood specimens collected from Wisconsin residents. These isolates include 5 _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ with PFGE [pulse field gel electrophoresis] outbreak pattern 1, 3 isolates of _E. anophelis_ with non-outbreak PFGE patterns and 1 isolate of _Elizabethkingia_ species. These MIC results demonstrate susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, minocycline, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The medical literature suggests combination treatment with these agents may be more effective than monotherapy. Whenever possible, treatment should be guided by AST.)The organism was first characterized in a 2011 report (1), isolated from the midgut of _Anopheles gambiae_. A PubMed search found several reports of human infection, an 8 day old girl with meningitis from the Central African Republic (2), 2 neonates with meningitis in Hong Kong of whom one of the mothers had chorioamnionitis with the organism (3), and an intensive care unit cluster of 5 cases from Singapore (4). Since it can be easily confused with _E. meningoseptica_ (an organism previously referred to as _Flavobacterium meningosepticum_ and then _Chryseobacterium meningosepticum_), other cases may well have occurred. All of these cases were nosocomial in origin unlike, apparently, the Wisconsin/Michigan cases.References----------1.
