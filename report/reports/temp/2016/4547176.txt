It is certainly true that many causes of illness mimicking yellow fever exist. One of these is the rare occurrence of reactions to the vaccine itself. Such cases have been labeled yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) (Seligman SJ. Risk groups for yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). Vaccine 2014;32:5769-75). No cases of YEL-AVD have been laboratory-confirmed in Africa. All of the laboratory-confirmed cases of YEL-AVD have occurred either in South America or in prospective travelers.One knows that responding to an ongoing yellow fever epidemic with mass vaccination campaigns and with mosquito control measures is extremely challenging. However, if cases mimicking yellow fever occur in vaccinated persons, specimens should be sent for viral culture and tissue preserved by freezing. If the virus turns out to be vaccine-like rather than yellow fever, the diagnosis of YEL-AVD is confirmed and tissue sent for study to see if there is a genetic immune defect that predisposes to YEL-AVD (Seligman SJ, Casanova JL. Yellow fever vaccine: worthy friend or stealthy foe? Expert Rev Vaccines 2016;15:681-91).--Stephen J. Seligman, MDAdjunct ProfessorThe Rockefeller UniversityNew York, NYResearch ProfessorNew York Medical CollegeValhalla, NYUSA<sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Seligman for his comments. Based on experience with yellow fever vaccinations in South America and in travelers, as Dr. Seligman noted, now with over 10 million individuals vaccinated in Angola and the DR Congo, one might expect a few cases of YEL-AVD to have occurred. Confirming them would require laboratory support sophisticated enough to do the genotyping and comparisons. That might require prior arrangements with a WHO reference laboratory, perhaps the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Senegal. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>][See Also:Yellow fever - Africa (103): Angola, Congo DR, WHO 20161007.4544742Yellow fever - Africa (102): Angola, Congo DR, WHO 20161003.4531657Yellow fever - Africa (101): Angola, Congo DR, WHO 20160924.4513048Yellow fever - Africa (100): Angola, Congo DR 20160920.4503422Yellow fever - Africa (99): RFI 20160913.4483731Yellow fever - Africa (98): Uganda 20160906.4469058Yellow fever - Africa (97): Congo DR, Angola, WHO 20160903.4462186Yellow fever - Africa (96): Congo DR, Angola 20160901.4456772Yellow fever - Africa (95): Congo DR, Angola 20160827.4446460Yellow fever - Africa (94): Congo DR, Angola 20160824.4437239Yellow fever - Africa (93): Congo DR, Angola 20160819.4423837Yellow fever - Africa (92): WHO, Angola, Congo DR, letter to WHO 20160814.4415083Yellow fever - Africa (91): Angola, Congo DR, WHO 20160811.4408318Yellow fever - Africa (90): Angola, Congo DR 20160809.4403110Yellow fever - Africa (89): Angola, Congo DR, WHO 20160806.4397616Yellow fever - Africa (88): WHO, vaccines, laboratory 20160731.4381568Yellow fever - Africa (87): Congo DR, corr. 20160726.4371449Yellow fever - Africa (87): Congo DR 20160725.4368957Yellow fever - Africa (86): Uganda NOT 20160725.4368717Yellow fever - Africa (85): WHO 20160722.4363921Yellow fever - Africa (84): Congo DR 20160721.4360548Yellow fever - Africa (82): WHO, Congo DR 20160716.4349810Yellow fever - Africa (81): Angola (ML) 20160711.4338261Yellow fever - Africa (80): Angola, Congo DR 20160709.4334260Yellow fever - Africa (76): Angola 20160704.4324166Yellow fever - Africa (71): WHO, Angola, Congo DR 20160624.4306180Yellow fever - Africa (62): Angola, Ghana, WHO 20160604.4265710Yellow fever - Africa (61): Angola, Congo DR, WHO 20160604.4262798Yellow fever - Africa (60): risk of international spread, historical overview 20160601.4259427Yellow fever - Africa (58): WHO 20160528.4250752Yellow fever - Africa (57): WHO 20160522.4237288Yellow fever - Africa (56): WHO, Uganda 20160518.4230607Yellow fever - Africa (55): WHO 20160514.4222137Yellow fever - Africa (54): Angola 20160512.4218603Yellow fever - Africa (53): vaccine 20160510.4212027Yellow fever - Africa (52): WHO 20160506.4206937Yellow fever - Africa (48): current situation 20160430.4194719Yellow fever - Africa (43): Angola comment 20160420.4172389Yellow fever - Africa (40): Angola, WHO 20160414.4158727Yellow fever - China (08): ex Angola 20160413.4156986Yellow fever - Africa (38): Angola (HM) 20160412.4155494Yellow fever - Africa (35): Angola 20160409.4149455Yellow fever - Africa (34): Angola, WHO 20160404.4137096Yellow fever - Africa (07): Angola (LU) RFI 20160201.3984228and other items in the archives].................................................lm/ty/je/lm"
