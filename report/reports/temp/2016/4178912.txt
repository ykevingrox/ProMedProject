The Acting Director of the agency stated that the medical sources in the province show that the deaths recorded were the result of an unknown virus. The director added that severe acute diarrhea and vomiting are the main symptoms of this strange epidemic. A Somali official stated that there had been about 40 deaths, mostly children and women in Middle Juba province. It should be noted this region lies entirely under the control of al Shabaab rebels, which could hamper any relief efforts.Analyst note:Limited diagnostic procedures could hamper efforts to properly diagnose any medical emergencies since Juba is a southern province under rebel control. Due to the disconnection of the region from the capital city were most functioning hospitals and medical organizations reside, the probability of misdiagnosis is high. Food and waterborne illnesses are extremely common in the region (typhoid and cholera) due to the lack of infrastructure. According to WHO, common causes of morbidity and mortality in the region are: 1) diarrhoeal diseases, including cholera; 2) tuberculosis; 3) malaria, which affects mainly pregnant women and children under 5; and 4) measles. There have been no confirmed polio cases in Somalia since 2002 <http://www.who.int/hac/about/donorinfo/somalia.pdf>.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea are non-specific. The cause could be enteric bacteria, or viral and parasitic pathogens. Any further information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39190>.].................................................lk/je/sh"
