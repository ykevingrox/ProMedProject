Loop News [edited]<http://www.looptt.com/content/caribbean-and-americas-free-measles-transmission>The Caribbean and countries of the Americas are the 1st in the world to be declared free of local measles transmission. This historic announcement was recently made by the International Expert Committee for Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Americas at the 55th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) [26-30 Sep 2106]. This means that children in the Caribbean are now less likely to be affected by measles, once they are vaccinated.Measles affects mostly children and is one of the most contagious diseases. However, widespread use of the vaccine has led to a great reduction in measles cases in the Region. ""No local measles cases have been reported in the Caribbean Region since 1991,"" stated Dr C James Hospedales, executive director, Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). He warned however, that ""we cannot become complacent, as measles still circulates in other parts of the world.""Dr Hospedales went on to say ""due to the high intensity of international travel related to the large tourism sector, the Caribbean region remains at high risk for the importation of measles and rubella cases."" Between 1971 and 1979, more than 100 000 deaths in the Americas were attributable to the disease.Measles is transmitted by airborne droplets or via direct contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of infected individuals. It can cause serious complications including blindness, severe diarrhoea, ear infections and pneumonia, particularly in children with nutritional problems.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Good news! But as the report warns, countries that are measles-free are still susceptible to introduced virus in the form of infected travelers, so they must remain vigilant.A map of the Americas including the Caribbean may be found at <http://planetolog.com/maps/map-world/big/Central_America.gif>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Australia (South Australia) ex Indonesia (Bali)Date: Sun 20 Nov 2016Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/additional-measles-case-reported-south-australia-linked-bali-travel-65012/>South Australians are being reminded to check their vaccination status for measles after another measles case was confirmed today [20 Nov 2016]. SA Health's chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips has said that a 1 year old boy is in a stable condition at home after contracting the disease in Indonesia:""Immunization provides the best protection against measles and it's vital that everyone makes sure they've had 2 doses of the measles vaccine not only to protect themselves but to protect the wider community. Measles is highly contagious and can be airborne, so it is easily spread, through coughing and sneezing, amongst people who are not immunized. People should look out for the symptoms that include fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes, followed by a blotchy rash which begins on the head and then spreads down the body.""SA Health is urging anyone who isn't fully immunized or who was in the locations at the times listed to be alert for symptoms over the next few weeks and to see a doctor if they become ill.Professor Phillips said it is imperative that anyone who believes they have the symptoms of measles to contact their doctor prior to visiting. ""If people believe they have the symptoms of measles they should phone their GP ahead of their visit and mention why they are attending so that precautions can be taken to avoid spreading disease to others,"" Professor Phillips said.""People born in the late 1960s to mid-1980s may believe they are fully immunized but many only received one measles vaccine and therefore they can still be at risk, so they are advised to visit a GP or local council immunization clinic to obtain the full measles (MMR) vaccine. Children should receive their 1st measles vaccination at 12 months and the 2nd at 18 months of age. It is also important to note that the infectious period begins prior to the symptoms being present and therefore any person infected with measles will not be aware that they are carrying the disease.""Today's cases take the total number of confirmed cases in South Australia this year [2016] to 11, compared to 4 cases for all of 2015.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Australia can be accessed at <http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/286>. - Mod.LK]******[3] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)Date: Mon 21 Nov 2016Source: The Express Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1237803/preventable-deaths-epidemic-spreads-three-children-die-measles/>While the national focus remains on fighting polio, a number of other vaccine-preventable diseases continue to take the lives of children. Villagers and elected representatives told the media on [Sun 20 Nov 2016], that 3 children have died of measles in Torghar district [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province], while many more in different parts of the district are reportedly afflicted with the disease.The villagers said that the deadly epidemic broke out in Judba and Darbani tehsils [sub districts] last week [week of 14 Nov 2016]. The 1st known victim was a 2-3 year old girl, who died in Judba, Torghar district's headquarters. Soon after, 2 boys between the ages of 1 and 3 years also died of measles, while many others are being treated locally, as the underdeveloped district has limited healthcare facilities.""Yes, 2 children died in Darbani village and one in Judba, and yes, many others have been taken ill with symptoms of measles,"" said Gul Taj Akazai, a member of the Torghar District Council, when asked to confirm the incidents. Abdu Rauf, the Darbani Village Council nazim [member of village council], also confirmed the reports.They explained that Basic Health Units (BHU) in the area were short of medicines and trained staff, forcing 60 per cent of villagers to rely on 'traditional medicine', while many others take their children to Mansehra or other cities with hospitals. ""BHUs in our district are even short of measles vaccine, which has aggravated the risk,"" said Akazai.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Pakistan can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/28105>. - Mod.LK]******[4] QatarDate: Tue 22 Nov 2016 0:18 ASTSource: The Peninsula Qatar [edited]<http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/22/11/2016/Ministry-urges-vaccination-as-six-measles-cases-reported>At least 6 cases of measles were confirmed [in Qatar] over the last 3 months, as Ministry of Public Health [MoPH] is set to wrap up its national immunisation campaign against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Some 160 000 children have been vaccinated as part of the campaign, which began here on [17 Oct 2016], the ministry announced yesterday [21 Nov 2016].In the last 3 months the ministry has recorded 6 confirmed measles cases. The disease was detected in those who had not taken the MMR vaccine. The ministry stressed that such cases could be prevented and measles be eliminated in Qatar if parents ensure their children take the 2 routine doses of MMR vaccination and also the booster dose that is given for free as part of the ongoing MMR campaign.Early this year [2016], 22 cases of measles were reported. However the incidence rate and number of measles cases in Qatar have dropped rapidly during the last few years, from 160 confirmed cases in 2012 to 18 cases in 2015.As the campaign enters into the 6th week, some 339 schools, including 214 government schools and kindergartens and 125 private schools, have been covered. Earlier, owing to the huge demand, the ministry had extended the campaign, which was to conclude on [14 Nov 2016] until 30 Nov 2016. The vaccine is available at all the primary healthcare centres, and also at various health facilities including private clinics. The ministry has urged parents whose children are between the ages of 1 and 13 years and have not yet been vaccinated during the campaign, to get their children inoculated.The ministry has advised parents to avail of the booster dose before the end of the campaign to enhance and ensure the immunity, in children, against the highly contagious diseases. MoPH stressed the need for taking the booster dose, considering the fact that more cases are being still detected here. Meanwhile, the ministry also organised an open vaccination day at the Pakistan Education Center, on [19 Nov 2016], which saw huge attendance. A team from the ministry inoculated children who had not taken the vaccine at schools or health facilities.To signify the importance of vaccination against measles and vaccination campaigns, WHO, UNICEF, CDC, and GAVI in a joint press release on the stated that despite a 79 per cent worldwide decrease in measles deaths between 2000 and 2015, nearly 400 children still die from the disease every day. The statement also stressed on the importance of mass vaccination campaigns clarifying that mass measles vaccination campaigns and a global increase in routine measles vaccination coverage saved an estimated 20.3 million young lives between 2000 and 2015.In its commitment to ensure the well being and safety of all children and in line with the vision and recommendations of these international organizations, MoPH has organised the current national MMR campaign.[byline: Huda NV]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Qatar can be accessed at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Qatar.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/130>. - Mod.LK]
