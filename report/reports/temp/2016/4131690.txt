Star Africa, APA (African Press Agency) report [edited]<http://en.starafrica.com/news/cameroon-alarmed-by-fake-yellow-fever-vaccine.html>The Cameroonian government has issued a warning, urging officials of the national drug supply structures and public and management of private health facilities to ensure that the falsified versions of the vaccine ""Amaril stabilized"" against yellow fever is not in their stocks. Coming from the Pasteur Institute in Dakar under the lot number 2265 and June 2017 as expiry date, the manufacturer said he has found errors and other irregularities on the package, for which the results of laboratory tests are not known yet.The institutions having such product in their stocks are invited to stop distributing and to isolate [destroy?] the vaccine, authorities urged.--Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[One hopes that the warning about fake yellow fever (YF) vaccine is heeded and acted upon. A knowledgeable individual provided this observation in February 2016: ""Although yellow fever is a risk in Cameroon, many cases of yellow fever are not usually reported to health facilities in most of our communities. Cameroon considers the certificate of yellow fever vaccination to be valid for life for arriving travelers from all countries if the traveler is more than 8 months of age. This may not be the actual situation since most law enforcing officers at the borders are considered corrupt and may be paid to overlook their duties when it comes to boundary issues."" Given that infected individuals have traveled recently from the ongoing YF outbreak in Angola to other African countries, the risk of entry of a YF virus infected individual arriving in Cameroon is real. The situation is further complicated because several African countries have had a recent history of issuance of fake YF vaccination cards. If a YF outbreak is initiated either because of inadequate border controls or fake YF vaccination cards, the consequences, in terms of disease and loss of life, could be significant. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/65>.]
