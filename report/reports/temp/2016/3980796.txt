Voice of America (VOA) News [edited]<http://www.voanews.com/content/rat-poison-flies-off-shelves-as-lassa-fever-spreads-in-nigeria/3165019.html>An outbreak of a fever similar to the Ebola virus has Nigeria on edge. Lassa fever has sickened at least 57 people and killed 34 since it broke out in Nigeria late last year [2015].The disease is transmitted by rats [multimammate mice, [_Mastomys_ spp.], and in its later stages shares symptoms with Ebola, which killed over 11 000 people in West Africa after it broke out in 2013. Lassa fever, which is named after a town in Nigeria's northeastern Borno State, sickens people who come into contact with rat excrement. Symptoms in the early stage include headache and fever, while in later stages people can bleed from their mouth and other orifices.The fever broke out in parts of the country's north, before spreading south to the commercial capital Lagos and to Edo and Akwa Ibom states in the Niger Delta.Hassan Garba, a hospital director in the northern city of Bauchi, blamed the transportation of crops for the spread of the disease. ""When you're moving food material like grains from the north to the south or the east or to the west of the country, you most probably may be moving with rats who can hide among shipments,"" said Garba.That's led to a run on supplies of rat poison in cities across the north. In Kaduna, [a resident] said he wasn't taking any chances at home. ""This fever brought by rat, so that is why I'm rushing to the market and I'll buy... rat medicine in order to kill all the rat that is in my house,"" he said. A merchant said his supplies of the poison were exhausted. ""People are rushing the rat poison now. I don't even have enough to sell,"" he said.But the director of the Kaduna state ministry of health Ado Zakari Mohammed warned people to be cautious with the poison, which is deadly to humans.[Byline: Chris Stein]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Nigeria (Lafia, Nasarawa state)Date: Sat 30 Jan 2016Source: Vanguard [edited]<http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/01/605552/>A medical [doctor] in Dalhatu Specialist Hospital (DASH) Lafia, has been confirmed dead after treating a patient with Lassa fever in the only specialist hospital owned by the state.The death of the medical doctor brings the toll to 2, while scores are hospitalized, mostly in Lafia.[The doctor] was among the members of the rescue team in DASH, He has since been buried according to Islamic injunction.Consequently, medical personnel from DASH Lafia have decided to join the ongoing strike action leaving the state grounded.Dr Edego Egba, the chairman of the medical advisory committee of the hospital confirmed this to selected journalists.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Nigeria (Jigawa state)Date: Thu 28 Jan 2016Source: 360 nobs [edited]<http://www.360nobs.com/2016/01/lassa-fever-kills-1-26-surveillance-jigawa/>Authorities of Jigawa state have confirmed the outbreak of Lassa fever in the state as one person has been reported dead with over 26 other persons who had contact with the deceased currently under surveillance.Commissioner of Health, Dr Abba Zakari, while confirming the sad development, stated that the victim, who resided at Gujubaki village in Dutse Local Government area of the state had just returned from Port Harcourt in Rivers State and reported to Dutse General Hospital with signs and symptoms suggestive to Lassa fever.The commissioner said that the state ministry of health was contacted immediately after the hospital management noticed the case, adding that the ministry without further ado sent its Rapid Response Team, RRT, which consisted of 3 doctors, disease notification officers (DNOs), and an epidemiologist to examine the victim and take a sample of his blood.According to him, the blood sample of the victim was taken to a laboratory in Abuja where it was confirmed positive.

CopyEd.LMI, edited]<http://news.acotonou.com/h/81102.html>Reports have showed for the last 2 weeks the presence of Lassa hemorrhagic fever in the commune of Tchaourou and this was confirmed on [Thu 28 Jan 2016] by the Ministry of Public Health of Benin, with the results from samples taken and sent for analysis in Nigeria.According to Dr Christian Tchaffa Boni, Secretary General of Benin's Ministry of Public Health, of the 5 cases suspected in the outbreak of Lassa hemorrhagic fever virus registered in the health zone of Tchaourou, only 1 case was positive, according to the results from the samples sent to Lagos for analysis.Therefore, in order to protect the people of Benin and particularly those in the health zone of Tchaourou in northern Benin, the Beninese official recommended several specific measures, including the compliance with instructions given by health workers on prevention and conduct if symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, bleeding, fatigue, and others occur.The authorities also urge people to contact the nearest health workers at the onset of the 1st symptoms, to follow hygiene and sanitation rules, to avoid eating bush meat and handling wild animals, and to stop eating cereals and other foods contaminated with salts, urine, and other secretions from infected animals.It should be noted that a health worker who was suspected to have the disease and who was sent to the Departmental Hospital (CHD-Borgou) in Parakou died a few days ago, and 4 other cases are currently hospitalized in intensive care at the Papane health center. But according to the latest cross-referenced information, 3 of them were cured of the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Benin can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/benin/beu51k8n/benin_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22157>.Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety.The circumstances under which 2 of these Nigerian patients and the one from Benin acquired their Lassa fever virus infection are not stated. The Nigerian physician acquired his infection in the hospital.This is now the 4th report of Lassa fever that ProMED-mail has posted for Benin recently; the previous 3 occurred during an outbreak in 2014-2015.The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.- Mod.TY]
