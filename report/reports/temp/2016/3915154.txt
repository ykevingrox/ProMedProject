Vanguard [edited]<http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/01/lassa-fever-kills-mother-2-week-old-baby-in-rivers/>A mother and her 2-week-old baby have been confirmed dead following a recent outbreak of Lassa fever in Rivers State.Vanguard gathered that the woman lost her life on 30 Dec 2015 after successfully giving birth through caesarean, while the baby later died on 1 Jan [2016], having contracted the deadly Viral Hemorrhagic Disease from her late mother.Confirming the deaths, the Rivers State Commissioner of Health, Dr. Theophilus Odagme, said when the symptoms of Lassa Fever were noticed in the dead woman that experts in the Department of Microbiology, University of Port Harcourt were consulted and samples from her were also sent to a Specialist Centre in Lagos where it was confirmed that it was the dreaded ailment.Odegma disclosed that contact tracing of the people who are infected with the disease has begun, adding that the state government has geared up efforts to stop the spread and further death.Odegma said: ""The public is hereby assured that the government is on top of the matter and is doing everything to address the situation as the state government, World Health Organization and other partners and stakeholders are working tirelessly to address the outbreak adequately. The public is encouraged not to panic but report to the nearest hospital or Health Centre if they experience symptoms such as persistent high fever, stooling, vomiting and bleeding from the nose, mouth and anus.""He warned: ""Lassa fever is highly contagious and easily transmitted by rodents and direct contact with infected blood, urine or faeces, so people are advised to improve on the sanitation of their environment to prevent contact with the rat.""[Byline: Davies Iheamnachor]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There were no Lassa fever cases reported in Rivers state in 2015. The latest Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health Bulletin No. 5 (44) issued on 6 Nov 2015 indicated that Lassa fever cases were reported in 12 states in Nigeria in 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151125.3819446). Lassa fever virus [LFV] is endemic in Nigeria, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country.LFV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with an infected individual's viremic blood in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Several cases of transmission have occurred in hospitals. Fortunately, there were no cases among the Kano AKTH staff in the previous ProMED-mail report.As the late Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived posting 20130131.1524034: ""In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multisystem disease. Rarely, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients.""The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the reservoir rodent host. In the absence of adequate infection control measures, person-to-person virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments, or in laboratories testing samples from patients.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.A map of Nigeria can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3038>. - Mod.TY]
