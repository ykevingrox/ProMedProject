WHO influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update number 255, based on data up to 17 Jan 2015------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------High levels of influenza activity continued in some countries in western Asia. And increasing influenza activity was reported in northern America, northern and eastern Europe, and northern/temperate Asia. Most detected influenza viruses were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.- Influenza activity was slowly increasing but still below seasonal expected levels in northern America. In northern and eastern Europe increasing influenza activity was reported, with still low activity in western and southern Europe. An increase in severe acute respiratory infections due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was reported from some eastern European countries.- In northern/temperate Asia, influenza activity was ongoing in Mongolia and was increasing in the Republic of Korea.- In central and western Asia, influenza activity remained at high levels where Israel, Jordan, and Oman reported increased influenza activity, predominantly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses. Pakistan reported also elevated influenza activity, predominantly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.- Few influenza virus detections were reported by countries in tropical Africa.- In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America, and the Caribbean, respiratory virus activity was at low levels.- In tropical Asia, countries in southern and southeast Asia overall reported ongoing low influenza activity.- In temperate countries of the southern hemisphere respiratory virus activity remained low.- National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 91 countries, areas, or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 28 Dec 2015 to 10 Jan 2016 (data as of 22 Jan 2016 11:40:20 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 65 649 specimens during that time period. 10 502 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 8481 (80.8 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 2021 (19.2 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 5506 (80.2 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1357 (19.8 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 460 (49.1 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 477 (50.9 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.Source of data--------------The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[Additional information on topics below and map of activity can be found at sites listed at the source URL above:Detailed influenza update <http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2016_01_17_surveillance_update_255.pdf?ua=1>Seasonal update Seasonal influenza reviews <http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/GIP_surveillance_summary_reviews_archives/en/>Regional updates on influenza for AMRO <http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3352&Itemid=2469&lang=en>EURO <http://flunewseurope.org/>WPRO <http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/Influenza/en/>Updates on the influenza at the human-animal interface <http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/en/>Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface (HAI) Disease outbreak news <http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/>- Mod.LK]
