The regional government of Madrid said in a statement that she had been discharged and ""would not need to be monitored and can lead a normal life"".It said health officials would monitor hospital staff that looked after the patient for 14 days after their last contact with her--a period that corresponds with the typical incubation period of the virus. The nurse became infected while treating a 62-year-old man who died from the virus on 25 Aug [2016]. He caught the virus after he was bitten by a tick while walking in the countryside in the northwestern Spanish region of Castile and Leon.Spanish health authorities said this was the 1st time the disease had been found in Western Europe in someone who had not travelled to an endemic area. The virus has been found among ticks in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe and southwestern Europe.Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks from a range of livestock and domestic animals. It has a fatality rate of 10-40 percent. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected animal blood or ticks. CCHF can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The admission of this nurse was reported in Promed post: Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Spain (02): (Madrid) 20160906.4466392.
