National survey of colistin resistance among carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ and outbreak caused by colistin-resistant OXA-48-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, France, 2014. Euro Surveill. 2016; 21(37): pii=30339----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------From Jan 2014 to Dec 2014, 972 consecutive non-replicate carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ isolates from colonised or infected patients were collected at the Associated French National Reference Centre as part of the French national survey on antimicrobial resistance. It included 577 _Klebsiella_ spp (59 per cent), 236 _Escherichia coli_ (24 per cent), 108 _Enterobacter_ spp (11 per cent), 50 _Citrobacter_ spp (5 per cent), and a single _Salmonella_ spp isolate (0.1 per cent). Of 561 _K. pneumoniae_ isolates, 35 were found to be resistant to colistin (6.2 per cent). PFGE analysis revealed a clonal outbreak involving 15 _K. pneumoniae_ isolates belonging to sequence type ST11, recovered in a single hospital in the Picardie region in northern France. Those clonally related isolates showed variable levels of resistance to colistin, ranging from 4 to 64 mg/L. They harboured the _blaOXA-48_ carbapenemase gene and the _blaCTX-M-15_ extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] gene. Among the 91 _Enterobacter cloacae_ isolates, 7 were resistant to colistin and produced different types of carbapenemases. Surprisingly, none of the _E. coli_ and _Citrobacter_ spp isolates showed resistance to colistin. This national survey including carbapenemase-producing isolates recovered in 2014 reported a high rate of colistin resistance in _K. pneumoniae_ and _E. cloacae_ (6.2 per cent and 7.7 per cent, respectively) in France.Discussion----------We describe here a clonal outbreak involving 15 _K. pneumoniae_ isolates recovered from a single hospital in the Picardie region in northern France. This outbreak was caused by a colistin-resistant OXA-48 and CTX-M-15-producing _K. pneumoniae_ of ST11 type that was susceptible only to cefoxitin, amikacin, and fosfomycin. Surprisingly, those clonally related isolates had variable MIC [minimum inhibitory concentration] values for colistin ranging from 4 to 64 mg/L. An ST11 clone co-producing OXA-48 and CTX-M-15 was responsible for a large outbreak involving 44 patients in a hospital in Madrid, Spain, from 2009 to 2014 but only 3.4 per cent of the isolates were resistant to colistin [11].Several outbreaks of colistin-resistant KPC [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase]-producing _K. pneumoniae_ (mainly attributed to the international epidemic clone type ST258) have been reported across Europe, in Greece [12,13], Hungary [14], Italy [15-17], and the Netherlands [18]. A single outbreak of colistin-resistant VIM-1-producing _K. pneumoniae_ has also been described in Spain [19].We report also 20 colistin-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ strains recovered from the regions Ile-de-France and Provence-Alpes-CÌ«te d'Azur. These strains belonged to 10 sequence types (n=2 ST147, n=3 ST258, n=6 ST101, n=3 ST307) and PFGE analysis identified 18 patterns among the 20 isolates. All 3 KPC-producing _K. pneumoniae_ isolates belonged to ST258, the most common clone for KPC-producing isolates [20]. The OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ isolates belonged to 9 sequence types with 6 strains that were ST101, the most common clone identified among OXA-48-positive _K. pneumoniae_ [21].Sequencing of the _mgrB_ gene revealed _mgrB_ alterations which are likely to be responsible for colistin resistance as described previously [5-7]. Interestingly, the three strains belonging to the single clone M recovered in the Provence-Alpes-CÌ«te-d'Azur region had different mechanisms of _mgrB_ inactivation (table 2: see URL above for table). The occurrence of such different mechanisms of colistin resistance among clonally related isolates indicates that it is not the product of clonal dissemination of a single colistin-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ strain, but rather clonal dissemination of a carbapenemase-producing isolate, which has acquired colistin resistance thereafter.The rates of colistin resistance among the carbapenemase-producing isolates were 7.7 per cent for _Enterobacter_ spp and 3.6 per cent for _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (excluding the isolates responsible for the outbreak in the Picardie region). The resistance rate observed among the carbapenemase-producing _K. pneumoniae_ isolates was much lower than the high rates reported in the neighbouring countries of southern Europe such as Spain (20 per cent) [19] and Italy (43 per cent) [1].None of the 236 carbapenemase-producing _E. coli_ isolates were colistin-resistant or carried the _mcr-1_ gene. This is surprising considering that a recent report of the French antimicrobial resistance Resapath surveillance network identified the plasmid-borne _mcr-1_ gene in 21 per cent of ESBL-producing _E. coli_ isolates recovered from faeces of veal calves in France between 2005 and mid-2014 [22]. The plasmid-borne _mcr-1_ colistin resistance gene has also been found in many neighbouring countries of France, for example among ESBL-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ isolates recovered from river water and imported vegetable samples in Switzerland [23], in _E. coli_ isolates recovered from calves and piglets in Belgium [24], in swine and human wound infections in Germany [25], and in food and human bloodstream infections in Denmark [26]. The _mcr-1_ gene was also detected in _Salmonella enterica_ from food samples in Portugal [27] and France [28]. An _E. coli_ isolate co-harbouring the _blaVIM-1_ carbapenemase gene and the _mcr-1_ gene was described in Switzerland [29] and an isolate co-producing NDM-9 and MCR-1 was reported from China [30]. We believe that the plasmid carrying the _mcr-1_ gene might be currently more prevalent among ESBL-producing isolates than among carbapenemase-producing isolates in human samples, which would explain why we did not identify this gene in our collection of carbapenemase-producing isolates.Amikacin and fosfomycin were most effective against the colistin and carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ (susceptibility rates of 80 per cent and 75 per cent, respectively) and _E. cloacae_ isolates (susceptibility rates of 87 per cent). The rate of tigecycline non-susceptibility was high (70 per cent for _K. pneumoniae_ and 50 per cent for _Enterobacter_ spp), probably because of a strong selective pressure by this last-line antibiotic.Conclusion----------This national survey on carbapenemase-producing isolates recovered in 2014 discovered a high rate of colistin resistance in _K. pneumoniae_ and _E. cloacae_ (6.2 per cent and 7.7 per cent, respectively) in France. These resistance rates remain much lower than those observed in other European countries such as Greece, Italy, and Spain. No plasmid-encoded _mcr-1_ gene was identified here. Therefore it seems that it is still possible to control the spread of those multidrug-resistant isolates based on accurate identification of colistin resistance and isolation of plasmid-encoded MCR-1 producers. Amikacin and fosfomycin remained the antibiotic agents most effective against those isolates, which were resistant to polymyxins and produced a carbapenemase.[The full article, including tables, figures, and references, is available at the source URL above.]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Clinically, both the carbapenems and colistin are ""antibiotics of last resort"" -- that is, used in situations in which the patient is seriously infected with a multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacillus resistant to all antimicrobial drugs, except for these few drugs. In the above study, the colistin/carbapenem resistant isolates remained susceptible to amikacin and fosfomycin, but were commonly resistant to tigecycline. IV fosfomycin is not available in the United States. No plasmid-encoded _mcr-1_ gene was identified among these carbapenemase-producing isolates; rather, colistin resistance was found to be due to chromosomal encoded mechanisms. The investigators thought that this might be due to a higher prevalence of the _mcr-1_ gene among ESBL-producing isolates than among carbapenemase-producing isolates in human samples in France. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>.]
