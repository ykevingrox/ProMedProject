For further information visit: <https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/>The 3 cases visited multiple locations between 26 Nov and 15 Dec [2016] including:- Inner city hospital emergency departments- GP clinics and medical centres in George Street, Sydney, Darlinghurst, Leichhardt, Camperdown and Bondi- Restaurants and shops in the CBD, Ultimo, Bondi, Bondi Junction, Leichhardt, Double Bay, Chatswood and Marrickville- Public transport on routes in the centre, north and east of the city.Sydneysiders who have not been vaccinated should be on high alert, health authorities say.While these are the known locations the 3 cases visited while infectious, the area of risk could potentially be far broader, said Vicky Sheppeard, Director Communicable Diseases at NSW Health.Dr Sheppeard warned people in Sydney who had not had their 2 doses of the measles vaccine should be on high alert in the coming days and weeks.""The measles virus is highly contagious and is spread through the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease,"" Dr Sheppeard said.""A highly effective measles vaccine has been freely available for many years and it is vital for everyone, including adults and children, to have 2 doses of the measles vaccine during their lifetime.""Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes and a cough, followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.Measles can have serious complications, particularly for young children.""Children or adults born during or since 1966 who do not have documented evidence of receiving 2 doses of measles vaccine, or evidence of previous measles infection, are likely to be susceptible to measles and should be vaccinated as soon as possible,"" Dr Sheppeard said.""If you develop the symptoms of measles, seek medical advice. Please call ahead to your doctor or emergency department so that arrangements can be made to keep you away from others to minimise the risk of infection.""Anyone born during or since 1966 should have 2 doses of vaccine (at least 4 weeks apart). For young children, the measles vaccine is recommended at 12 months and again at 18 months of age.NSW Health offers free MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine through GPs for people born during or since 1966 with no records of having received 2 doses of MMR vaccine.Dr Sheppeard said the 1st adult measles case reported this month had acquired the infection outside of Australia.""It's important that people planning to travel overseas are fully vaccinated against measles before departure to reduce their risk of contracting measles and then bringing the disease back to Australia and putting others at risk.""NSW Health is urging people to watch for symptoms of measles after another 2 adults contracted the highly contagious disease in Sydney following a case reported earlier this month.""[Byline: Kate Aubusson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Australia may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/296>. - Mod.LK]******[2] CommentDate: Wed 14 Dec 2016From: Jody Lanard <jody@psandman.com> [edited][Dr. Lanard is responding below to a statement made in Mumps - USA (31): (TX) colleges (WA) 20161214.4699512: ""Risk of infection with mumps (and measles) in colleges is high because of waning immunity following childhood vaccination with MMR.""]I am pretty sure this is not often the case for measles, although the unusual 2014 outbreaks in the Federated States of Micronesia (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6438a7.htm>) suggested a fair amount of secondary vaccine failure -- or alternatively, a historical vaccine cold chain failure -- in vaccinated adults.In the CDC's Pink Book (<https://www.cdc.gov/VACCINEs/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/meas.pdf>), the section entitled ""Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy"" contains this sentence with regard to measles immunity: ""Some studies indicate that secondary vaccine failure (waning immunity) may occur after successful vaccination, but this appears to occur rarely and to play only a minor role in measles transmission and outbreaks.""Obviously, the mumps vaccine is much more problematic, both in terms of its initial lower level of immunogenicity, its known potential for waning immunity, and the reality of outbreaks in dense congregate living quarters. So the question of a pre-college mumps shot bears consideration. There is, however, another age cohort in the U.S. which contains a significant subgroup which is not immune to measles: approximately 3-7 percent of U.S. children between their 1st MMR at age 12-15 months, and their 2nd MMR at age 4-6, according to the ACIP-recommended schedule. Somewhere between 93 percent and 97 percent of children given their 1st MMR between 12-15 months develop full immunity to measles. As you know, the need for the 2nd measles dose is entirely based on giving a 2nd chance to the approximately 3-7 percent of kids who do not sero-convert (primary vaccine failure) after the 1st dose.So the current MMR schedule leaves approximately 3-7 percent of between 3 to 5 birth cohorts of children -- primary vaccine failure kids who have not yet had their 2nd MMR yet at age 4-6 -- unprotected against measles. Calling the average failure rate approximately 5 percent after the 1st dose, this means there are between 600 000 and 1 000 000 children (5 percent of between 12 million and 20 million kids, based on approximately 4 million kids/birth year) between 1 and 6 years of age with no immunity to measles. And not because of anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant parents! Because of the ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; <www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip>] vaccine schedule!By any definition of the term ""delay,"" postponing the 2nd MMR to age 4-6 is a ""delay."" If we're truly worried about measles, I don't think we should wait for large pre-school measles outbreaks to impel us to move the 2nd MMR to an earlier age. This is low-hanging fruit for improving herd immunity.Since everyone I know is tired of hearing me sound off on this, I thought I'd use the occasion of my note to you about the non-high risk of measles in college-age kids to veer off onto my hobby horse vaccine issue!--Jody Lanard M.D.The Peter Sandman Risk Communication Website<jody@psandman.com>[ProMED thanks Dr. Lanard for her informed response raising the issue of the immunization schedule with MMR. There is some support for a 3rd vaccination to protect against mumps; but with measles, which does not present the same problem with waning vaccine immunity, she believes the schedule of immunizations seems more critical. - Mod.LK]
