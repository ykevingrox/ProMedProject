But if it does, please take this alert seriously.There is a big epidemic of yellow fever (YF) going on in Angola, West Africa, with over 1000 cases and hundreds of deaths. Cases have spread to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Mauritania in Africa and to China, the 1st ever confirmed cases and deaths from YF in Asia.There is no YF epidemic in any of those other 3 African countries, yet. But it is the dengue season in them now and soon will be in southern China. Since YF is spread by _Aedes aegypti_, one of the mosquitoes that spread dengue (and chikungunya and Zika viruses), there is an obvious risk. Look at how fast chikungunya and Zika have spread across the world. But those do not kill many people (apart from perinatal birth defects in the case of Zika). However, in the case of YF, 20 percent of unvaccinated people die.Of course, we have a vaccine, but world stocks of 7 million doses have been exhausted just to protect the population of Luanda, Angola's capital. 18 million more are needed for the rest of the country, but only half that number will be available by the end of next month (April 2016); 19 million are on contracts to UNICEF and could be repurposed. Around 40 million more may be available by the end of the year [2016], but China will need 300 million if it spreads across its dengue-endemic provinces.If YF were to spread in Asia,  where 2 billion are at risk in 18 dengue-affected countries, hundreds of thousands could die before YF vaccine stocks could be boosted and delivered.  Apocalyptic forecasts of the numbers of fatalities from Ebola turned out to be wildly wrong, and we can hope that will again be the case here, but given the way Zika has exploded in the Western hemisphere, we can`t count on it.  One international vaccine expert, Reinaldo Martins, did a study that showed the Brazilian vaccine could be stretched 5-fold for adults using subcutaneous injection, and another, Tom Monath, believes existing stocks could be stretched 10-fold without loss of potency, and delivered more cheaply by scratch with disposable smallpox needles. To prove this needs a field trial, which will take a few months. But we may have time if we start now. Brazil has the capacity to carry out a field trial if given the funding. WHO and other international agencies such as EMA (the European Medicines Agency) could help with that.Then there is mosquito control. Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) have succeeded in reducing malaria in the tropics. Outdoor fogging only gives temporary results; long lasting pyrethroids are useful for indoor and perifocal spraying. DDT is authorized by WHO for use in an emergency, but although legal in India may require legislation elsewhere. Intensified vector control with active community participation will have the advantage of reducing cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika and their associated costs.Recent research indicates that Zika virus probably reached Brazil months before it was detected, because its symptoms are similar to those of dengue and chikungunya and did not kill anybody until a surge in birth defects was noticed. An increase in hemorrhage and deaths would be put down to DHF/DSS (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) -- the jaundice characteristic of YF does not appear in every case and would be diagnosed as hepatitis -- so nobody would think of testing for YF, even if they had the reagents. There will be a delay before there is laboratory confirmation, like there was in Angola, allowing an epidemic to take hold disastrously.Training of vaccination and laboratory staff, collection of the outdoor trash in which the mosquito breeds as well as it does in small water containers indoors, and provision of bednets, other supplies and equipment all take time, which is why it is important that dengue-prone countries begin right away to develop a national YF contingency plan. WHO has a blueprint for one available on request, and there is a relevant slide show on <http://www.pitt.edu/~super1>.But take note: if your country does NOT have year-round or seasonal dengue, this alert is NOT for you -- unless you plan to travel to one that does..--John P. ""Jack"" Woodall, PhDCo-founder & Associate Editor, ProMED-mail[My concern is that with so many pressing demands on public health agencies in the dengue-endemic counties -- malaria in many, Chagas disease in some, schistosomiasis in others, hepatitis and other enteroviral diseases in most, to mention a few -- long-range planning and pre-outbreak preparation gets short shrift until an outbreak such as yellow fever hits. Vaccination of 70-80 percent of the population at potential risk is one obvious approach, but adequate supplies of the vaccine are necessary, and trained vaccination teams must be available for its administration. With vaccination, vector control and avoidance, the eternal question is: Who will pay for what is needed in the absence of a crisis? Prevention is cheaper than crisis response, as Angola health authorities are in the process of finding out. Gambling that yellow fever will never hit costs nothing -- until it does. - Mod.TY][See Also:Yellow fever - Africa (30): Mauritania ex Angola 20160326.4119691Yellow fever - Africa (28): Angola, Chinese workers 20160324.4116627Yellow fever - Africa (26): Congo DR 20160320.4107262Yellow fever - Africa (25): Angola comment 20160319.4106114Yellow fever - Africa (24): Kenya ex Angola 20160318.4104819Yellow fever - China (04) ex Angola 20160322.4109684Yellow fever - China (03): ex Angola 20160319.4106312Yellow fever - China (02): ex Angola 20160318.4105105Yellow fever - China: ex Angola, 1st case in Asia 20160313.4089857].................................................sb/jw/ty/msp/jw"
