The epidemiology of leprosy is intriguing to say the least. Most leprologists believe that transmission is from humans to humans, via respiratory route. However, for an anthroponotic agent, continued transmission requires a reasonable level of prevalence of cases in the community, which is not the case in rare sporadic cases.The alternate hypothesis, held by a few, is soil to human transmission, which is plausible, and will explain the very low incidence of leprosy in places where it had been prevalent previously, but had virtually disappeared. This pattern is known in Japan, Northern Europe, Southern US, etc. In such places leprosy disappeared almost completely probably due to wearing of footwear and cleaning skin with water and soap.Experimental infection in mice is by footpad injection, not by respiratory tract inoculation. Armadillos are vigorous diggers of holes in the earth and vulnerable for that reason. Thus soil as source is possible, as documented by 2 groups of workers in India.References---------Chakrabarty AN, Dastidar SG. Is soil an alternate source of leprosy infection?
