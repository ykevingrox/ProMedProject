Scrub typhus may have been causing illness and fatalities before as well, but the disease was not identified in the country until last year [2015],"" said Dr Guna Nidhi Sharma, deputy health administrator at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, during an interaction in Chitwan.Scrub typhus is an acute, febrile, infectious illness that is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, and if untreated, could lead to death. Rodents are the main vectors of the disease. Scrub typhus is transmitted to humans and rodents by some species of trombiculid mites.According to the data compiled by the division, 101 people were diagnosed with scrub typhus as of mid-April, 2016. As many as 8 of the patients lost their lives, 5 among them in the last 5 months.Scrub typhus had mostly affected the people from Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura, Dhading, Nuwakot, Sankhuwasabha and Khotang last year [2015]. This year [2016], the disease has also been detected in people from Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Dhankuta, Bhojpur, Gorkha, Baglung and Parsa. In Chitwan alone, 145 scrub typhus cases were diagnosed.Dr Dayaram Lamsal, director of the Chitwan Medical College and Teaching Hospital, said Chitwan had a high number of diagnosed cases because people from other parts of the country also visit the district for treatment.[byline: Bimal Khatiwada]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Nepal can be seen at <http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm> (regions and districts) and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/139>.
