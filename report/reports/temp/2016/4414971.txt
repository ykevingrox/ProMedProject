Valley Courier [edited]<http://www.alamosanews.com/v2_news_articles.php?heading=0&page=72&story_id=42759>Public health officials confirmed this week that a resident of Costilla County [Colorado] has contracted hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), bringing the number of confirmed hantavirus cases to 5 in the San Luis Valley so far in 2016. HPS is a rare but serious respiratory disease that results in death for more than 1/3 of those who become infected.Hantavirus is carried by deer mice in our area. The best way to prevent exposure to hantavirus is to avoid stirring up and breathing dust from mouse nests or mouse droppings in areas with poor ventilation.

The specific hantavirus involved in this and 2 previous cases that ProMED-mail has posted this year (2016) is not reported. Most likely it is Sin Nombre virus. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including Colorado. The spring and summer seasons often bring sporadic cases of hantavirus infections, as cabins and other buildings unused over the winter are opened up and cleaned in the western USA. Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus and shed it in feces, urine and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.San Luis Valley includes parts of Conejo, Costillo, Suagueche and Mineral counties and laps over into northern New Mexico.
