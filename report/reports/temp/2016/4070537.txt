KBOI [edited]<http://kboi2.com/news/local/syphilis-outbreak-reported-among-men-in-canyon-county>Health officials say a syphilis outbreak has been reported in Canyon County [Idaho] among men -- nearly 4 times the normal amount. Southwest District Health said Thursday [3 Mar 2016] that 21 cases of the sexually transmitted disease have been reported since January 2015. Southwest District officials say most of the people who have contracted the STD are men (average age 29), gay or bisexual and who have reported alcohol and substance abuse problems. ""We are concerned because many cases report meeting sex partners on-line or through mobile applications,"" said Randi Pedersen, epidemiologist. ""If you are worried about a sexual contact that you have had, we urge you to protect yourself and get tested."" Anyone who suspects they have been exposed can get a free, confidential blood test by calling 455-5345. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts <promed@promedmail.org>[Canyon County, with a population was 188 923 in 2010, is located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Idaho (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon_County,_Idaho>).
