The cases are infected in Sweden and come from different parts of the country.25 Oct 2016A further 2 cases have been linked to the outbreak and to date, 12 cases of the same type of _E. coli_ O157 have been linked together using whole genome sequencing and a further 4 cases are epidemiologically linked. The two new cases became ill in mid-September [2016].Contact tracing and tracking of suspect foods are ongoing and relevant infectious disease units, NFA [National Food Agency], National Veterinary Institute, Agriculture, and Public Health Agency are working together to investigate possible links and causes.19 Oct 2016So far 10 cases of the same type of _E. coli_ O157 been linked together using whole genome sequencing and a further 4 cases are epidemiologically linked.The latest case was diagnosed on 4 Oct 0216. The cases are infected in Sweden and come from different parts of the country, the majority, however, from the Stockholm area. 6 of the cases are children aged 0-12 years. 3 of the cases have been hit by the serious complication HUS.The actual type of the _E. coli_ O157: H7 (stx2a, stx2c, eae) is clade 8, which often causes more severe disease than other O157 strains. Clade 8 is one of the most common types of EHEC associated with HUS cases in Sweden.The symptoms of EHEC range from mild symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain to bloody diarrhea. The disease is a zoonosis, that is, a disease transmitted between animals and humans. Ruminants, cattle in particular, are the main reservoir of the bacteria.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although initially associated with undercooked ground beef, the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ strains (either the prototypic O157 strains or otherwise) are zoonotic organisms linked to ruminants, especially cattle. Transmission can be from undercooked meat, contaminated produce such as lettuce, tomatoes, and sprouts, recreational or municipal water, and person-to-person. The vehicle for transmission is not established here. Any information would be welcome. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/108>.]
