Europe Online Magazine, Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) [edited]<http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/swedish-woman-diagnosed-with-lassa-fever_447712.html>A Swedish hospital reported [Fri 1 Apr 2016] that it was treating a female patient with Lassa fever, citing that she had contracted the disease while travelling in West Africa. Her condition was improving, the Sahlgrenska University Hospital said.However, in line with national guidelines, she would be shortly moved from the hospital in the west coast city of Gothenburg to a special unit at Linkoping University Hospital, south-west of Stockholm.As a precaution health officials were also generating a list of people, including those in the hospital, who had close contact with the patient.In 2011, a Swedish woman who worked for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in West Africa was also treated at Linkoping for the disease.According to the World Health Organization, the Lassa virus is transmitted to humans from contact with rodent excretions, and between humans through blood, urine, and bodily secretions, as well as contaminated medical equipment.The disease results in hearing loss in 25 percent of patients, and in severe cases the mortality rate can be as high as 15 percent, the WHO says. Symptoms include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and diarrhoea.The 1st confirmed case of the disease was in 1969, in Lassa village in Nigeria's Borno State. The disease is endemic in several West African countries but rare in Europe.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Importation of Lassa fever from West Africa into Europe and the United States has occurred occasionally in the past. In this case, it is not clear if the patient came down with symptoms in West Africa, as the previous case in Sweden had, or became unwell in Sweden.As Mod.CP commented concerning the 2011 case, ""Lassa haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks duration that occurs throughout West Africa. Though first described in the 1950s, the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969. The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family _Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria but probably exists in other West African countries as well. About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multisystem disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days.""Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the ""multimammate rat."" _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces. (An image of a multimammate rats can be viewed at <http://www.360nobs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lassa-Fever..-Rats.jpg>.)""Lassa fever can affect all age groups. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans, but person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings.""An extensive time line of cases imported from West Africa into Europe, the USA, Canada and Israel is given in ProMED-mail archive no 20110310.0778. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/108>.]
