The company said the cheese may be contaminated with _E. coli_, a bacterium that can cause cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. The company said that between March and July 2016, 7 people were sickened by the same strain of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. A sample of Grassfields cheese tested positive for the bacterium, according to a state lab.While most _E. coli_ infections are mild, about 5-10 percent of patients infected with these enterohemorrhagic (Shiga toxin-producing) bacteria develop a potentially life-threatening complication that can shut down their kidneys, according to the CDC.The recall involves all types and sizes of organic cheeses manufactured between 1 Dec 2015 and 1 Jun 2016, including:GoudaOnion 'n GarlicCountry DillLeydenEdamLamont CheddarChili CheeseFait FrasPolkton CornersCroftersThe recalled cheeses were sold online and from Grassfields Cheese's Coopersville store.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As can be seen in the list of previous postings below, EHEC infections can be spread through cheese vehicles.
