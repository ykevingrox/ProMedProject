Columbia (MO) Daily Tribune [edited]<http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/three-sturgeon-area-kids-sickened-by-e-coli/article_38155550-7071-55a3-b5d0-654b45a55885.html>Three Sturgeon Elementary School students are among 4 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ infection in Boone County [Missouri], but there is no evidence the sicknesses are related to the school, Sturgeon Superintendent Shawn Schultz said [Wed 7 Sep 2016].Schultz said 2 kindergarten students and a 1st-grader were sickened by the bacterium and one was still in the hospital. He said at least 2 of the students were hospitalized. ""We don't have any reason to believe it was contracted here at school,"" Schultz said, adding that the 1st case was diagnosed and treatment began before the school year started. He said it was not possible to completely rule out a connection to the school.""Even though we don't believe it was contracted here in the school, we are still taking it very serious and making sure we are not a place of transference"" for the bacterium, Schultz said. He added that the school's custodial staff and kitchen and cafeteria workers were taking extra precautions to clean restrooms, hard surfaces, and cafeteria tables with hydrogen peroxide or diluted bleach water.The Columbia/Boone County Department of Public Health and Human Services said late [Tue 6 Sep 2016], in a news release that 4 cases of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ had been confirmed in Boone County and that public health officials were monitoring 2 additional probable cases in preschool and school-aged children.Andrea Waner, spokeswoman for the city/county health department, said public health officials were reviewing laboratory analyses and cases to determine possible causes of the outbreak, but the source had not been determined. While most strains of _E. coli_ are harmless, she said, several are known to produce toxins that can cause mild diarrhea, with most confirmed cases developing severe diarrhea -- often with blood -- and abdominal cramps. Usually little or no fever is present.The Sturgeon School District's lead nurse, Mary Wolf, sent letters to parents on 26 Aug 2016 and again [Wed 7 Sep 2016], that said the health department had confirmed a 3rd case of _E. coli_ in a Sturgeon elementary student. Wolf's letter notified parents that if their children are seen for diarrhea at school, the parent will be notified and the student will be sent home immediately. The student must remain at home until a stool specimen is negative for _E. coli_ bacteria.The department's last report of an _E. coli_ outbreak was in April 2012. 4 out of 8 confirmed cases were Boone County residents. The common link among those cases was the consumption of raw, unpasteurized milk from a farm in Armstrong, but samples taken from the Howard County farm tested negative for the bacteria. One of the victims of the 2012 infections was a 2-year-old Boone County girl who was hospitalized for several days.[Byline: Jodie Jackson Jr]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the cluster involves children from the same elementary school, it is not at all clear if the transmission occurred in the school. The serotype of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is not stated. ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope and the vehicle of transmission.While food (undercooked hamburger and salad produce) is a common reservoir, cases and outbreaks can be associated with petting zoos and other livestock exhibitions, as well as municipal and recreational water supplies. - Mod.LLThe state of Missouri can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22132>.
