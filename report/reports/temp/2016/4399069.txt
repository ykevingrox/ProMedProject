When a ProMED moderator identifies an event for which additional information would be helpful, the moderator sends a request for information (RFI) to EpiCore members in the geographical region affected. EpiCore members may then respond to the RFI via a secure web platform, providing additional information as available. The ProMED moderator may then include useful information in subsequent ProMED posts (some examples below). The identity of EpiCore members is kept confidential, but members may choose to include their identity and affiliation in any ProMED posts or may choose to keep them confidential.Are you interested in joining EpiCore? Members must have an advanced degree in the human or animal health fields (e.g., human or veterinary medicine, nursing, public health, microbiology) plus a knowledge of the basic principles of epidemiology, infectious disease, and/or related fields.
