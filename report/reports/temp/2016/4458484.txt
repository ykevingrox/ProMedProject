The Spain Report [edited]<https://www.thespainreport.com/articles/883-160901142820-one-dead-one-in-isolation-after-two-cases-of-crimean-congo-hemorrhagic-fever-confirmed-in-madrid>Madrid regional health authorities [have] confirmed 2 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] have been detected in the Spanish capital, after receiving the results of tests from the National Microbiology Centre. Regional health authorities said in a statement that it was the 1st home-grown, non-imported case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in western Europe.A 62 year old man died on [25 Aug 2016 in Madrid's Gregorio MaraÌ±Ì n University Hospital, having been admitted first to the Infanta Leonor Hospital, close to the VicÌÁlvaro district in the south-east of the city. The 2nd patient is an intensive care nurse at that 1st hospital who was infected by the virus whilst caring for the 62 year old man. She was moved in a special ambulance last night [night of 31 Aug 2016] to the infectious disease wing of the La Paz-Carlos III Hospital, for treatment.A further 200 people who came into contact with the 2 infected patients are being checked, and some confined to their homes, but so far no new cases have been detected.""Everything points to the origin of the illness in the 1st case being in the tick bite"", said a statement by regional health authorities: ""which the patient himself referred [to a doctor] following a walk in the countryside in Castile and Leon, and that the nurse became infected on coming into contact with his bodily fluids whilst treating him in the intensive care unit of the Infanta Leonor Hospital.""The regional health department told The Spain Report that the town where the male patient had been for a walk in the countryside was Ì vila (Castile and Leon). The nurse's colleagues reported her symptoms to public health authorities.According to the World Health Organization, ""Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the _Bunyaviridae_ family"" and is ""endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north -- the geographical limit of the principal tick vector."" It has a 10 per cent to 40 per cent mortality rate.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States says the hemorrhagic fever ""was first characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected ticks or animal blood. CCHF can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We are grateful to SE Rodriguez, of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA, who also notified us of this incident, and reminded us that ""since 2012, researchers have identified the presence of CCHF virus genome in ticks collected throughout Spain. This is the 1st documented case, subsequent mortality, and nosocomial transmission of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Spain.""
