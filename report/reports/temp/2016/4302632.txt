Speaking on condition of anonymity, the 32-year-old man said his friend, who was living with him and his mother then, fell ill with TB in February 2012. The man said he got TB 3 months later [May 2012], and his 75-year-old mother too, in October last year [2015]. She is among the 3 individuals still undergoing treatment.The other 3 residents of the same block were diagnosed in April 2014, October [2015], and [May 2016], said the Health Ministry yesterday [15 Jun 2016], which described the localised cluster as a ""highly unusual"" one.The man, who works at an IT shop, said that after the 2012 Parklane cluster was discovered, he was among the 112 family members, friends, and close contacts of the patients who were called up for screening. 5 of 6 patients then had been to at least one of the 3 cybercafÌ©s there; the last [the 6th case] was a family member.In May that year [2012], he was hospitalised for a month for multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR TB) and put on medication for 18 months subsequently before he was declared ""clear"", he said.His mother was also diagnosed with latent TB then, which refers to TB in its asymptomatic, non-infectious state. She was only diagnosed with [active] MDR TB in October last year [2015] and has been undergoing treatment in the Communicable Disease Centre since then, he added.Speaking to TODAY over the phone on [Thu 16 Jun 2016], the man said his friend's ""negligence"" in taking medication may have been what caused the disease to spread to him and his mother. ""(My friend) did not take the situation seriously, did not care to take medication ... His condition worsened and he was later admitted to the hospital for a year,"" he said. His friend moved out about 1.5 years ago. Asked how he felt when he was tested positive for the disease, he said: ""I knew I was probably infected ... But when I was told it had become active MDR TB, I felt angry at (my friend), I scolded him ... His negligence can be deadly.""He added that the medication he had to take caused side effects that made him quit his previous job, leaving him unemployed for a year. ""The medication made me feel like a zombie. I was weak, lethargic, and depressed,"" he said. He now helps to repair computers in a firm close to his home.The man -- the youngest of 6 children and the only one living with his mother -- still attends yearly reviews at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, but has not relapsed since. His mother will likely be discharged sometime next year, he said. Her spirits have improved but she remains bedridden, he added. He has encouraged his neighbours to get tested for TB at the screenings that will be provided at the foot of the block until [Sun 9 Jun 2016], as a precautionary measure. ""I told them they must go for the blood test downstairs ... I hope (they have not been infected),"" he said. ""But this disease is hard to prevent.""[Byline: Kelly Ng]--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report above says that the current outbreak of MDR TB in an Ang Mo Kio neighborhood in Singapore is linked to a 2012 outbreak of MDR TB. The 2012 outbreak involved 6 cases of MDR TB in Singaporeans, 5 of whom frequented three cybercafÌ©s at the Parklane shopping mall; the 6th case was a family member (<https://www.ttsh.com.sg/about-us/newsroom/news/article.aspx?id=4458>). We know that the genotype is the same for all 6 isolates of MDR TB in the current Ang Mo Kio outbreak, which confirms that it is a common source outbreak. However, we are not told if this genotype in the current Ang Mo Kio outbreak of MDR TB is the same as the genotype of isolates in the 2012 cybercafÌ© outbreak. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3609>.]
