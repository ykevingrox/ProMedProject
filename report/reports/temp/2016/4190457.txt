WHO Emergency Preparedness Response, Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/27-april-2016-lassa-fever-germany/en/>Lassa Fever -- Germany----------------------On 20 Apr 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for Germany informed WHO that a previously reported case of Lassa fever in Germany has fully recovered and been discharged from hospital in Frankfurt. This secondary case was an employee of the funeral home tasked with handling the primary case's corpse on 2 Mar [2016] (see DON posted 23 Mar 2016 [and ProMED-mail archive no. 20160324.4115285]).The case had recovered by 6 Apr [2016], when all the contacts completed their 21-day follow-up period; however, his hospital discharge was delayed due to persistent viraemia. The patient was discharged after 2 consecutive negative test results by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Tests were performed on blood, urine, and pharyngeal swab samples at 24-hour intervals.WHO risk assessment-------------------Based on the current information, there is no further risk of secondary transmission of Lassa fever in Germany. Lassa fever cases have been reported among travellers returning from West Africa. The risk of disease spread to non-endemic countries by travellers from Lassa fever endemic countries in the West Africa is very low.WHO advice----------WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Germany based on the information available.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[It is good to learn that there are no additional cases, and that the mortician who had contact with the corpse of the index case has recovered. The above report did not indicate how many days after the acute illness of the mortician he was viremic. These cases illustrate the effectiveness of rapid isolation of the suspected cases following initial positive laboratory tests. The timely and complete reporting of the events from beginning to end as they unfolded is commendable.A HealthMap/ProMED map of Germany can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101>. - Mod.TY]
