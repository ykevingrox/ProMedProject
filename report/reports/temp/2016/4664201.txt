Alaska Dispatch News (AND) [edited]<https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/health/2016/11/28/3-dead-this-year-as-outbreak-of-new-strep-bacteria-hits-alaska/>The Alaska section of epidemiology reported on Tuesday morning [29 Nov 2016] that an additional death in Fairbanks was not originally included in its data. The story has been updated to reflect 4 deaths due to group A streptococcal infection, instead of 3, as previously reported.A new strain of group A streptococcus [GAS or _Streptococcus pyogenes_] bacteria first identified in Fairbanks [Alaska] in early 2016 has caused an outbreak in Anchorage [Alaska], mainly among the homeless population, a state health department official said Monday afternoon [28 Nov 2016].At least 28 people in Fairbanks and Anchorage have been hospitalized since the bacteria were identified, and 3 have died due to different invasive diseases, said Joe McLaughlin, state epidemiologist and chief of the Alaska section of epidemiology with the Department of Health and Social Services. ""This outbreak is a new strain that we've never seen before. So having this increased number of cases of group A strep is not atypical,"" McLaughlin said.GAS bacteria can cause a wide range of infections, McLaughlin explained. Those range from less-severe strep throat and wound infections to potentially fatal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a quick-spreading bacterial skin infection that kills the body's soft tissue. Every year in Alaska, about 60 to 90 people with invasive diseases from GAS are identified, McLaughlin said. An invasive disease is one where germs enter normally germ-free parts of the body.The outbreak is the largest since public health officials began doing surveillance on the bacteria in 2000, McLaughlin said. The strain was first identified in early 2016 in Fairbanks. 10 people in the Interior community were hospitalized due to infection, and one died. Those cases trickled in, with 1 or 2 a month. No new cases have been seen in Fairbanks in several months, McLaughlin said.The strain was then identified in Anchorage in July [2016], and an outbreak started in October, when the number of cases shot up, McLaughlin said. In Anchorage, 18 people have been hospitalized, 2 people have died, and another 2 cases are suspected, pending lab results. 6 of the Anchorage patients have developed necrotizing fasciitis; 2 have developed toxic shock syndrome, a rare bacterial infection; 1 person has lost an arm and another person lost ""multiple digits,"" McLaughlin said; 1 had cellulitis -- a bacterial skin infection -- and the other had toxic shock syndrome.Of the 3 people who have died in Alaska, 1 had toxic shock syndrome, another had sepsis, where bacteria enter the bloodstream, and the third had pneumonia, McLaughlin said.People who are more susceptible to illness from GAS tend to be the elderly, very young people, and those with health complications, McLaughlin said. Many people become ""colonized"" by the bacteria but may not get sick, he said. ""From data that have been published nationally, there can be a higher risk in certain racial demographic groups,"" McLaughlin said, including Native Americans. ""It's unclear why that is,"" he said. The cases in Alaska have mostly been middle-aged Alaska Native men, McLaughlin said, and many have stayed at Anchorage homeless shelters. Alcohol abuse is another common condition noted on medical charts, McLaughlin said. Of the 3 who died, one was elderly, McLaughlin said. In Anchorage, 1 person was homeless but the 2nd was not. All 3 who died were Alaska Natives, according to McLaughlin.GAS has about 220 different strains. New strains are not commonly identified, McLaughin said. When they are, they are often associated with outbreaks, as people have not developed immunity to it.At Brother Francis Shelter, staff has been prioritizing education on how to identify symptoms, said program director Lisa Caldeira. Public health officials are interviewing patients and offering antibiotics to anyone with whom the patients have had close contact, McLaughlin said. They are distributing fact sheets about the bacteria, and working with hospitals to promptly identify wound infections and more serious illnesses.[byline: Laurel Andrews]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Group A streptococcus (GAS) is commonly associated with pharyngitis and skin infections but can also cause invasive infections, including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis (NF), toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur.Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (<http://www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html>). Over 200 _emm_ types have been identified.Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and detection of exotoxin-encoding genes (<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948>, <http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192>, <http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416>, and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911>). Molecular analysis of the isolates aids documenting a common source outbreak.The Arctic Investigations Program (AIP), which began surveillance of invasive GAS infections in Alaskan residents in 2000, found that 46 per cent of people with invasive group A streptococcal infections were Alaskan Natives, when Alaska Natives represent only 20 per cent of the Alaskan population and that the commonest _emm_ types in Alaskan Natives were types 49, 82, 87, 92, and 101, whereas _emm_ 1, 3, 12, 28, and 89 were commonest in non-Natives (<http://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2015/11/05/JCM.02122-15.full.pdf>).Molecular typing was reported to have identified the genotype _emm_-59 in half of the cases in an outbreak of GAS disease among the homeless and injecting drug users in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and also identified this same genotype in an outbreak of GAS disease that started in Western Canada more than a year before (ProMED-mail: Streptococcus, group A, emm-59, fatal - Canada: (ON) 20081011.3219).The news report above says that a new ""strain"" of GAS has been identified as causing an outbreak of invasive GAS infections in Fairbanks in early 2016 and subsequently in Anchorage, in mostly middle-aged Alaska Native men who had stayed in homeless shelters. Crowding in shelters likely facilitated person-to-person transmission. However, we are not told how this new ""strain"" has been characterized. Further information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206>.]
