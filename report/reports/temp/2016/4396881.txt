He said: ""The phone has been ringing off the hook with people from across the UK contacting us who are quite rightly concerned about this outbreak. They have been suffering with constant sickness and diarrhoea and many of them have been confined to their rooms. So far we have been contacted by people from several hotels but I understand there to be others that are also affected. It seems this bug is linked to contaminated food.""Health authorities are issuing warnings but with peak season and large crowds this bug has the potential to spread like wildfire.""Health Protection Scotland have warned UK travellers to be wary of the outbreak, which they say started in June [2016]. In a statement posted on their website, they said: ""Cases of infection with the diarrhoea causing parasite _Cyclospora_ have continued to be reported by UK holidaymakers returning from Mexico.""The majority of cases have stayed in all-inclusive resorts in the Riviera Maya area. Clusters of cases started to be reported during June and July [2016] from this popular destination.""The source of infection is thought likely to be a foodstuff supplied to hotels. Investigation into this outbreak is ongoing.""Awareness of the outbreak should be maintained and travellers to Mexico are strongly advised to maintain a high standard of food, water, and personal hygiene.""On return from Mexico, if you have any symptoms such as those described above you should seek medical attention and tell your GP about your travel history.""A spokesperson for Thomson said: ""We are aware of some reported sickness cases from Riviera Maya in Mexico. We are closely monitoring the situation and we are in direct contact with customers who have been in touch with us since their return.""[Byline: Mark Hodge]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The beginning of the outbreak was reported by ProMED-mail on 30 Jul 2016 (see archive no 20160730.4381665)._Cyclospora cayetanensis_ is transmitted to humans usually when human waste is used as fertilizer for vegetables. Previous outbreaks in the US and Canada have been linked to vegetables imported from Mexico. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11770>.]
