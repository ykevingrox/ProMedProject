Real Time News from AL.com [edited]<http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/alabama_reports_alarming_incre.html>The number of babies born infected with syphilis in Alabama more than tripled between 2015 and 2016, increasing from 3 to 10 and alarming health officials who track sexually-transmitted diseases and infant health.One of the babies born in 2016 was stillborn. Up to 40 percent of pregnancies in women with untreated syphilis end in stillbirth, miscarriage, or infant death. Syphilis infection can also cause serious birth defects including bone deformities and brain inflammation that can cause developmental delays, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. Pregnant woman who receive treatment for syphilis will not pass it on to their unborn children, said Dr Karen Landers, assistant state health officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health. ""This is a preventable condition,"" Landers said.Out of the 10 mothers identified in 2016, 8 received no or late prenatal care, according to the department of public health. County health departments already offer free and confidential testing for sexually-transmitted diseases, but employees there are increasing outreach to pregnant women, offering tests when women come in for other services, Landers said. ""By taking these measures, we are protecting an unborn population,"" Landers said.Cases of congenital syphilis passed from mother to baby have been reported in Jefferson, Madison, Mobile, Montgomery, and Shelby Counties.The increase in syphilis cases among newborns mirrors an uptick in untreated syphilis among adults in Alabama, said Dr Scott Harris, assistant state health officer and infectious disease specialist. ""We have an increase in congenital syphilis cases only because we have untreated syphilis in adults,"" Harris said.The number of syphilis cases increased by 90 percent in Madison County in 2016, prompting officials to issue an advisory.""Syphilis is still a disease that's always curable,"" Harris said. ""The biggest barrier is getting people in for testing."" Syphilis can cause a rash or sores in early stages. In later stages, the disease can cause organ damage, paralysis, and dementia. Doctors typically treat syphilis with a short course of antibiotics. Doctors discovered that antibiotics cure syphilis decades ago, and rates of infection plummeted for many years.Rates of sexually transmitted diseases are higher in Alabama than in the nation as a whole. In 2013, Montgomery had the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The number of primary and secondary cases of syphilis in Alabama jumped from 162 in 2014 to 277 in 2015, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. Nationwide, the number of syphilis cases has been rising in recent years.[Byline: Amy Yurkanin]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail recently posted a report on the rising incidence of syphilis in Alabama (Syphilis - USA (14): (AL) increased cases, RFI 20161120.4642802), but this news report failed to characterize the types of patients contributing to this increase.According to the CDC, the national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population in 2000 and 2001, the lowest rate since reporting began in 1941 (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm>). However, the P&S syphilis rate has increased almost every year since 2000-2001. In 2015, the national P&S syphilis rate increased 19.0 percent to 7.5 cases per 100 000 population. Men account for the most cases of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, with the vast majority of those cases occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM) (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stats.htm>). However, during 2013-2015, the rate increased among women, as well as men, perhaps as a spillover of the ongoing syphilis epidemic in MSM that could be attributable to MSM who also have unprotected sex with women. During 2014-2015, the incidence rate of P&S syphilis increased 18.1 percent among men (13.7 per 100 000 in 2015) and 27.3 percent among women (1.4 per 100 000 in 2015).These increases among women are of particular concern because congenital syphilis cases tend to increase as the rate of P&S syphilis among women increases. Syphilis can be passed from mother to infant during pregnancy, causing congenital syphilis. After decreasing from 10.5 to 8.4 reported congenital syphilis cases per 100 000 live births during 2008-2012, the rate of reported congenital syphilis has subsequently increased each year during 2012-2015. In 2015, there were a total of 487 reported cases of congenital syphilis, for a national rate of 12.4 cases per 100 000 live births. This rate represents a 6.0 percent increase relative to 2014 (11.7 cases per 100 000 live births) and a 36.3 percent increase relative to 2011 (9.1 cases per 100 000 live births).The state of Alabama in the southeastern region of the United States can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/205>.
