Hurriye Daily News [edited]<http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/town-quarantined-over-rabies-concerns-in-turkeys-south-.aspx?pageID=238&nid=104055>A town has been quarantined following the outbreak of a rabies concerns in the southern province of Osmaniye, with at least 104 people receiving treatment in hospital.""In order to prevent a negative outcome caused by rabies, the vaccination process of those coming from Ellek [DÌ ziÌ¤i district, Osmaniye province] has been continuing at DÌ ziÌ¤i State Hospital,"" a statement released from the Osmaniye Governor's Office read, noting that a sample taken from a person receiving treatment was sent to a research center in the neighboring province of Adana had come back positive for rabies.According to the investigations, a rabid dog bit 3 people and scratched another. The 4 subsequently interacted with a number of people who were then also taken to hospital, according to the statement.The governor's office also said cattle bitten by rabid dogs had been destroyed and buried in a hole 3 meters [9.8 ft] deep that was then covered with lime under the control of veterinarians. Moreover, the meat from a small cow that was slaughtered for Eid al-Adha [Festival of the Sacrifice] was destroyed as the machines that were used to process the meat were confiscated. In addition, the people who used the machines were sent to hospitals.""All of the areas that the rabid dog touched were determined and were disinfected,"" the statement added. A sign reading ""Rabies Risk Zone"" was hung at the entrance of the town amid other necessary warnings.All cattle in the village have been vaccinated against rabies, while the entrances into and exits from the town have been prohibited for all animals.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Several questions arise from the somewhat ambiguous report above from Osmaniye, Turkey's south central province (maps at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/turkey/maps/turkey-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55693>). The severe measures applied have reportedly started after receiving lab results confirming rabies in a person under treatment in a hospital. If this is a right interpretation of the information included, the exposure of said person and 3 others had taken place at least a week or rather earlier, which unfortunately means a poor prognosis for the said patient. The other 3 patients are, preferably, treated with human rabies immunoglobulin, hopefully available.As to the other measures applied, including the quarantined town, they are more applicable to an infectious disease which spreads directly among humans than to rabies, a viral disease which usually spreads from vector animals (mainly carnivores) during their infective period directly to their respective victims, and also not indirectly by contaminated structures.A professional report from knowledgeable sources would be helpful. - Mod.AS]******[2] Israel [Northern district]: fox, jackalDate: Sun 18 Sep 2016 10:30 AM IDTSource: The Yeshiva World News [edited]Date: Sun 18 Sep 2016<http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/463898/rabid-fox-found-in-northern-israel.html>Israel Health Ministry officials are confirming that a dead fox found near the northern Israeli city of Metula [Northern District] tested positive for rabies. Health officials are unaware of whether any persons or animals have come into contact with the rabid animal.Health officials explain that anyone who was in contact with the fox or who has a pet that might have been in contact with the fox between 31 Aug and 14 Sep 2016 is urged to immediately contact the district Health Ministry office. Each case will be judged individually regarding the need for prophylactic pharmaceutical intervention.Authorities ask parents to question their little ones to determine whether they may have come into contact with any wild animals and to contact health officials if necessary.--Communicated by:ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[The fox mentioned in the report above was the 19th rabies case diagnosed in animals in Israel since the start of 2016. A 20th case was reported 2 days later, on Wed 20 Sep 2016, involving a moribund jackal found on 19 Sep 2016. Upon discovery, the animal was suspected to be rabid or poisoned. It was lab-confirmed as rabid by the national rabies centre, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan.Since the beginning of 2016, Israel's rabies cases included 8 dogs, 5 cattle (beef herds, 3 calves, and 2 adult cows), 1 horse, 4 jackals, and 2 foxes.A map presenting all rabies cases in Israel between 1 Jan-18 Sep 2016 is available at <http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/90A17DF8-D526-45BC-B55E-5729CAC6BE15/0/mapa_kalevet_19_2016.jpg>.All but 2 of the 20 cases were confined to Northern Israel along the Lebanese and Syrian borders. 2 cases, a dog and a fox, were found in Eastern Israel, adjacent to the Jordanian border. The last human case of rabies in Israel occurred in 2003 (see archive no. 20030511.1171).Rabies is controlled in Israel by oral vaccination of wildlife (foxes, jackals) by aerial disposal (annual), combined with compulsory annual vaccination of domestic dogs. Currently, an advisory committee is studying a proposal to change the vaccination regime into a biennial (once in 2 years) one. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Israel can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55622>]******[3] India (Tamil Nadu): human, canine sourceDate: Tue 19 Sep 2016Source: New Indian Express [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Stray-dog-bite-TN-woman-dies-of-rabies/2016/09/19/article3624342.ece>A 30-year-old woman from Tamil Nadu died at Kozhikode [Kerala] Government Medical College Hospital around 2.30 pm on [Sun 18 Sep 2016], 1.5 months after she was bitten by a stray dog.According to the hospital authorities, [she] was brought to the hospital on [Sat 17 Sep 2016] with clear symptoms of rabies. On Saturday morning, [the woman] was taken to a private hospital at Kallampara [Kozhikode District, Kerala] with fever and hydrophobia. From there, she was brought to the casualty wing of the medical college as she developed muscle spasms. ""She was unable to drink water and was displaying symptoms [of] rabies. She was unable to speak and one of her children told us that she had been bitten by a stray dog,"" said Dr R Chandni of General Medicine wing of the medical college.[The victim], along with her husband 2 children, had been engaged in scavenging and carving grinding stones at Mannur Valavu in Kadalundy [Kerala] panchayat [local self-government council]. They were staying in tents and shop verandas. Though doctors tried to bring her back to normalcy, she failed to respond to treatment and succumbed to rabies by Saturday afternoon [17 Sep 2016]. ""The woman should have taken anti-rabies vaccination soon after she was bitten. The vaccination often fails to work if the patient seeks medical aid after a certain stage of infection,"" the doctor said.The body was taken to Mannur Valavu by Saturday evening [17 Sep 2016] after [the woman's] relatives and Kadalundy panchayat authorities arrived at the medical college.On [Thu 15 Sep 2016], in a biting spree by stray dogs, 8 persons from Chelavur and Panicker Road in Nadakkav were admitted to the medical college hospital. One of them, a 40-year-old, was mauled by a stray dog while she was resting inside her house at Panicker Road. The dog entered the house through one of the doors, which was kept open. [The woman] who sustained severe injuries on legs and hands, was discharged after treatment at the hospital.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[India leads, unfortunately, the world's list of rabies endemic countries. The tragic case described above reflects 2 main shortcomings:1. Poor awareness. A timely post-exposure treatment, for which the patient should have applied, could have saved her life.2. Widespread canine (dogs) infection. The huge unvaccinated stray dog population in India maintains the circulation of the virus and leads to human rabies.The 10th World Rabies Day is to be celebrated less than a week from now, on 28 Sep 2016. This undertaking is underlined by the goal to eliminate deaths from canine rabies by 2030. Since it began in 2007, the rabies community has aligned to make World Rabies Day a global phenomenon. The central means for that goal is maximal vaccination of the dog population. This year's [2016] theme is Rabies: Educate. Vaccinate. Eliminate.
