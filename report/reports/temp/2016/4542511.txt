Lake County Now [edited]<http://tinyurl.com/h4vtqvh>Mukwonago High School is among the schools in the state [Wisconsin] with reported cases of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) among athletes, according to Laura Heidelmeier, Mukwonago Areas School District nurse.Heidelmeier said HFMD virus usually affects younger children and children in daycare and is not typically found at the high school level. It's considered a minor illness, like the common cold.Families in the district were alerted after the cases of HFMD were confirmed.In young children symptoms of HFMD are mild and usually resolve in 7-10 days, according to a fact sheet from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. HFMD usually starts with a fever, poor appetite and a sore throat. 1-2 days after the fever starts, painful sores usually develop in the mouth, beginning as small red spots that blister and often become ulcers. A skin rash also develops, usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.Symptoms usually appear 3-7 days after exposure. HFMD is spread by contact with discharges from the nose or throat or the feces of infected people, according to the fact sheet.The best way to prevent the spread of illness is to wash hands often, Heidelmeier said.Parents in the district were reminded that if their child is experiencing a fever or rash on their hands, feet, and/or mouth, they should be kept home from school until at least 24 hours after the fever breaks and exposed vesicles are dry. Students will be checked by school health assistants to make sure the lesions are dry before being allowed back at school, Heidelmeier added.[Byline: Carol Spaeth-Bauer]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>
