Some health experts, however, believe it is dangerous to lift the ban on bushmeat.The Ivory Coast is a neighbor to 2 of the 3 countries where EVD killed greater than 11 300 people since December 2013.It is a difficult choice to make. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control [CDC], the meat of squirrel, deer, fruit bats and rats has long been a key source of protein for many in the region, but it is also a potential source of the Ebola virus. Bushmeat hasn't officially been linked to West Africa's recent EVD outbreak, but infections in Africa have been associated with hunting, butchering and processing meat from infected animals. -...more][There are so many reasons, Ebola just one of them, why eating bushmeat is a bad practice, but it is difficult to argue with starvation. - Mod.LK]Research--------September 2016.

(2016).doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw825 [Abstract.Ebola virus (EBOV) is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Filoviridae family. The leader and trailer non-coding regions of the EBOV genome likely regulate its transcription, replication, and progeny genome packaging. We investigated the cis-acting RNA signals involved in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that regulate replication of eGFP-encoding EBOV minigenomic RNA and identified heat shock cognate protein family A (HSC70) member 8 (HSPA8) as an EBOV trailer-interacting host protein. Mutational analysis of the trailer HSPA8 binding motif revealed that this interaction is essential for EBOV minigenome replication. Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analysis of the secondary structure of the EBOV minigenomic RNA indicates formation of a small stem-loop composed of the HSPA8 motif, a 3' stem-loop (nucleotides 1868-1890) that is similar to a previously identified structure in the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA and a panhandle domain involving a trailer-to-leader interaction. Results of minigenome assays and an EBOV reverse genetic system rescue support a role for both the panhandle domain and HSPA8 motif 1 in virus replication.]22 Sep 2016 Liberia: Tracking Rumors to Contain Disease: The Case of DeySay in Liberia's Ebola Outbreak<https://blog.usaid.gov/2016/09/tracking-rumors-to-contain-disease-the-case-of-deysay-in-liberias-ebola-outbreak/>[During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, rumors spread misinformation, fueled mistrust, caused panic and sometimes even prompted irrational behaviors. This is particularly true in the context of a health emergency when accurate information about a disease -- how to prevent, detect, contain and treat it -- can mean the difference between staying healthy or becoming infected and, in the worst case scenario, dying from it.When the Ebola epidemic began to rapidly spread in West Africa, so did the rumors. These rumors included claims of the bleach sprayed by health workers to sanitize the environment actually being the cause of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)]. Others believed EVD was the result of black magic. Suspicion and fear grew quickly across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the 3 most affected countries, sometimes leading to horrible incidents like the murder of a group of health workers, local officials and journalists in Guinea in September 2014.Responders who were on the frontlines in the 3 hardest-hit countries with EVD soon became aware that the epidemic was driven as much by misinformation as it was by weak health systems.To address the rumors and lack of accurate information, USAID's Health Communication Capacity Collaborative (HC3) initiative was designed to bring in-depth expertise in social and behavior change communication to manage the epidemic.][The spread of rumors is also detrimental in media reports outside the country. It is important for scientists and public health experts to communicate the facts to keep the public accurately informed. - Mod.LK]21 Sep 2016: USA - Experiences and Psychosocial Impact of West Africa Ebola Deployment on US Health Care Volunteers<http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/experiences-and-psychosocial-impact-of-west-africa-ebola-deployment-on-us-health-care-volunteers/>[Citation.Gershon R, Dernehl LA, Quershi QZ, et al.

Edition 1.doi: 10.1371/currents.outbreaks.c7afaae124e35d2da39ee7e07291b6b5.Abstract.---Background: This qualitative study was designed to assess health care volunteers' experiences and psychosocial impacts associated with deployment to the West Africa Ebola epidemic.---Results: Participants reported that they were motivated to volunteer because of a sense of responsibility and feelings of empathy and altruism. Immediately prior to deployment, most reported fear of contagion and death, as well as doubts regarding the adequacy of their training. Family members and close friends expressed high levels of concern regarding participants' decisions to volunteer. During the deployment, participants were fearful of exposure and reported feeling emotionally and physically exhausted. They also reported feeling frustrated by extreme resource limitations, poor management of the mission, lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and inability to provide high quality care. Upon return home, participants felt a sense of isolation, depression, stigmatization, interpersonal difficulties, and extreme stress.---Conclusion: Preparedness of volunteers was suboptimal at each stage of deployment. All stakeholders, including volunteers, sponsoring organizations, government agencies, and professional organizations have a shared responsibility in ensuring that volunteers to medical missions are adequately prepared. This is especially critical for high risk deployments. Effective policies and practices need to be developed and implemented in order to protect the health and well-being of health care volunteers to the fullest extent possible.][Methods can be found in full text cited above. - Mod.LK]23 Sep 2016 USA (Maryland): The Army is playing a key role in finding a cure for Ebola <http://taskandpurpose.com/army-playing-key-role-finding-cure-ebola/>[U.S. Army researchers from Fort Detrick are developing relationships with Ebola survivors in Uganda, who may hold the key to a vaccine or treatment for [Ebola virus disease (EVD)]. John Dye led a team from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases [USAMRIID] on a trip to Uganda in August 2016. Dye is chief of viral immunology at the institute.According to Dr. Dye, ""For the last 50 years, there have been Ebola outbreaks all over Africa, and a lot of them have occurred in Uganda. Uganda is a ""hotbed of viruses and bacteria,"" and people there have been living alongside the virus for years.Dr. Dye also said, ""We do know that monkeys carry Ebola as well, and monkey meat is a main staple of the diet of people in Africa.""Since 2011, researchers from the institute have traveled to Uganda about every 6 months to collect samples of Ebola survivors' blood. Certain types of cells in their immune systems may indicate how the body can successfully fight off the disease.Dr. Dye ""What's different about them and their status of their body, their genetics or their immune system that allowed them to survive when 70 percent of the other people succumb?"" he said.]Funding------18 Sep 2016: Mark Zuckerberg donated USD 25 million for the fight against Ebola<http://compaq.elaptopcomputer.com/mark-zuckerberg-donated-25-million-for-the-fight-against-ebola/>[Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, and his wife, Priscilla, are well-known for their philanthropic efforts.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>. - Mod.LKHealthMaps:Liberia: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54> Guinea: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>][See Also:Ebola update (58): news, research, funding, vaccine 20160918.4497393Ebola update (57): news, research, funding 20160911.4481043Ebola update (56): news, vaccine, research 20160904.4465145Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174].................................................lk/msp/mpp"
