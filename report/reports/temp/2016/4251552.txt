Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/05/highly-resistant-mcr-1-superbug-found-us-first-time>Bacteria carrying the very worrisome MCR-1 resistance gene -- which makes the last-line antibiotic colistin useless against them -- have been found in human and animal samples for the 1st time in the United States, according to a report today [26 May 2016] in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy [1] and a statement by federal health officials.A Chinese team 1st described the MCR-1 gene last November [2015], after finding it in pigs, pork, and humans. Since then scientists in several countries have found the gene, sometimes alongside other resistance genes, after examining their sample collections. The gene can be transferred to other organisms, compounding the concern.Today's findings involve a 49 year old woman whose urine contained _Escherichia coli_ harboring the MCR-1 gene and an _E. coli_ isolate from a pig intestine that also contained the colistin-resistance gene.The woman sought care at a clinic in Pennsylvania (United States) for symptoms of a urinary tract infection 1 month ago today [26 May 2016], according to researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. An _E. coli_ isolate cultured from her urine was forwarded to Walter Reed for drug-resistance testing.Susceptibility testing revealed the pathogen to be extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _E. coli_, which are typically resistant to several common antibiotics like penicillin and cephalosporins. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of the MCR-1 gene, signifying extreme drug resistance. In total, the bacterium contained 15 antibiotic-resistance genes on 2 plasmids (small DNA strands), one of them a novel IncF plasmid.""Colistin is one of the last efficacious antibiotics for the treatment of highly resistant bacteria. The emergence of a transferable gene that confers resistance to this vital antibiotic is extremely disturbing,"" said lead author Patrick McGann, PhD, of WRAIR, in a Walter Reed news release. ""The discovery of this gene in the US is equally concerning, and continued surveillance to identify reservoirs of this gene within the military healthcare community and beyond is critical to prevent its spread,"" he added.The authors wrote in their study, ""The association between mcr-1 and IncF plasmids is concerning as these plasmids are vehicles for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among the Enterobacteriaceae. Continued surveillance to determine the true frequency for this gene in the USA is critical.""The woman had not traveled outside the country in the previous 5 months, the authors wrote, so the strain is unlikely to have been imported. So far Walter Reed has tested 20 other ESBL-producing E coli isolates, and all have been susceptible to colistin, according to the study.The isolate will be stored in Walter Reed's Multidrug Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN), the release said. Researchers will be able to access it for research on drugs and other MCR-1 countermeasures.""Through our surveillance system, we have the unique ability to coordinate source information with susceptibility and sequencing data, and if need be, go back to understand changes in infecting organisms to best treat infection and track emerging multidrug resistant organisms,"" said Colonel Emil Lesho, MRSN director.US public health officials are urgently responding to contain and prevent the potential spread of MCR-1, according to the release. The active surveillance that helped identify the woman's isolate and the storage of isolates helps researchers identify trends in resistance and prevalence. The MRSN is a key component of the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, the release notes.On the animal side, today US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) scientists reported that they have found colistin-resistant _E. coli_ in a single sample from a pig intestine, HHS said in a blog post. The MCR-1 sample is also resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and other antibiotics.The USDA used a modified technique for detecting MCR-1, ""employing a targeted and extremely sensitive method to examine whole bacterial populations found in intestinal samples from food-producing animals,"" according to the post. So far the swine intestine sample was the only 1 of 949 samples screened that tested positive for MCR-1.In addition, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)'s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration have used whole-genome sequencing to search for MCR-1 in salmonella, _E. coli_ and klebsiella isolates obtained from people and retail meats. As of April [2016], more than 44 000 salmonella and 9000 _E. coli_ and shigella isolates have tested negative for MCR-1, HHS noted.""Although the findings suggest that mcr-1-mediated colistin resistance might be rare, HHS and USDA remind consumers that cooking all meat, poultry and fish to its proper internal temperature kills bacteria, viruses and other foodborne pathogens, whether or not they are antibiotic-resistant,"" the blog post said.Beginning this fall [2016], CDC's antibiotic resistance lab network will provide the infrastructure and lab capacity for 7 to 8 regional labs, as well as labs in all states and 7 major cities and territories, to detect and respond to resistant organisms recovered from human samples, HHS said.The blog post also said that CDC is working with the Department of Defense, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and other authorities to identify close contacts of the Pennsylvania patient and whether anyone became infected with bacteria containing the MCR-1 gene. And the USDA is trying to determine the farm of origin for the pig sample.[byline: Jim Wappes][1.

The gene has been found primarily in _Escherichia coli_, but has also been identified in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae from human, animal, food and environmental samples on every continent (2-5). In response to this threat, starting in May 2016, all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _E. coli_ clinical isolates submitted to the clinical microbiology laboratory at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) were tested for resistance to colistin by E-test. Herein we report the presence of _mcr-1_ in an _E. coli_ cultured from a patient with a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the United States._E. coli_ MRSN 388634 was cultured from the urine of a 49 year old female who presented to a clinic in Pennsylvania on 26 Apr 2016 with symptoms indicative of a UTI. The isolate was forwarded to WRNMMC, where susceptibility testing indicated an ESBL phenotype (table 1). The isolate was included in the 1st 6 ESBL-producing _E. coli_ selected for colistin susceptibility testing, and it was the only isolate to have a MIC of colistin of 4 micrograms/ml (all others had MICs less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml). Colistin MIC was confirmed by microbroth dilution and _mcr-1_ detected by real-time PCR (6). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of MRSN 388634 was performed on a PacBioRS II and Miseq benchtop sequencer._E. coli_ MRSN 388634 belonged to ST457, a rare _E. coli_ ST 1st identified in 2008 from a urine culture in the UK (7). It was subsequently identified from a bloodstream culture in Italy, where it was found to harbor the carbapenemase gene _bla_ KPC-3 and _bla_ CTX-M-55 (8). MRSN 388634 carried 15 antibiotic resistance genes, but no carbapenemases, that were harbored on 2 plasmids (table 2).The 1st plasmid, pMR0516mcr, was 225 707 bp in size and belonged to incompatibility group F18:A-:B1 (9). BLAST analysis indicated that pMR0516mcr represented a novel IncF plasmid. Notably, it shares 89 Kb of homologous sequence with pHNSHP45-2, a _mcr-1_ carrying IncHI2 plasmid described by Liu and colleagues (1). This shared sequence contains _mcr-1_ in association with ISApl1 (1), but in pMR0516mcr it is in a different location and orientation (Figure 1). pMR0516mcr also carried 7 additional antibiotic resistance genes, including the ESBL gene _bla_CTX-M-55 (Table 2). The 2nd plasmid, pMR0416ctx, was approx. 47 Kb in size and was assigned to IncN (table 2). It carried 7 antibiotic resistance genes including _bla_CTX-M-14. A complete description of both plasmids is under preparation.To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _mcr-1_ in the USA. The epidemiology of MRSN 388634 is noteworthy; the isolate was submitted from a clinic in Pennsylvania, and the patient reported no travel history within the prior 5 months. To date a further 20 ESBL-producing _E. coli_ from patients at the WRNMMC have tested negative for _mcr-1_, and are colistin sensitive. However, as testing has only been ongoing for 3 weeks, it remains unclear what the true prevalence of _mcr-1_ is in the population. The association between _mcr-1_ and IncF plasmids is concerning as these plasmids are vehicles for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among the Enterobacteriaceae (9). Continued surveillance to determine the true frequency for this gene in the USA is critical.Nucleotide Accession Numbers.

A coordinated response is under way to try to prevent its spread.Just over a year ago, President Obama released a National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria. As part of that plan, he also charged the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with co-chairing a Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (Advisory Council). In the past year, our 3 agencies and the Council have held numerous stakeholder meetings, made new discoveries, and undertaken new research to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics.In recent weeks, our 3 agencies have made some important discoveries regarding antibiotic resistance in the United States. Earlier this week, the Department of Defense notified stakeholders that its Multidrug-resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN) at the Walter Reed Institute of Research had identified the 1st colistin-resistant _mcr-1 E. coli_ in a person in the United States. A USDA and HHS search for colistin-resistant bacteria in food animals, retail meats and people also has found colistin-resistant _E. coli_ in a single sample from a pig intestine.These discoveries are of concern because colistin is used as a last-resort drug to treat patients with multi-drug resistant infections. Finding colistin-resistant bacteria in the United States is important, as it was only last November [2015] that scientists in China 1st reported that the _mcr-1_ gene in bacteria confers colistin resistance. Following the revelation in China, scientists across the globe began searching for other bacteria containing the _mcr-1_ gene, and the bacteria have since been discovered in Europe and Canada. The _mcr-1_ gene exists on a plasmid, a small piece of DNA that is not a part of a bacterium's chromosome. Plasmids are capable of moving from one bacterium to another, spreading antibiotic resistance between bacterial species.The patient with colistin-resistant _E. coli_ was treated in an outpatient military treatment facility in Pennsylvania. Biologic samples were sent to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for initial testing and then to MRSN for genetic sequencing to identify the _mcr-1_ gene.Our 3 departments take the emergence of this resistance gene very seriously. A coordinated public health response is under way to try to prevent its spread.For example, to respond to the DoD finding of _mcr-1_ in a human isolate, HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with DoD, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, local health departments, and others to identify close contacts, including household and healthcare contacts, of the Pennsylvania patient to determine whether any of them may have been at risk for transmission of the bacteria containing the _mcr-1_ gene. Similarly, USDA is conducting traceback work to determine the sampled pig's farm of origin.At the same time, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is continuing its search for evidence of colistin-resistant bacteria in the United States. For the past 20 years, NARMS has detected emerging resistance to clinically important antibiotics. NARMS is a partnership between HHS and USDA, as well as state and local public health departments, dedicated to tracking changes in the antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria found in ill people, in retail meats, and in food animals.After the detections in China, the NARMS teams began a 2-pronged approach to search for evidence of colistin-resistant bacteria caused by mcr-1 in the United States. First, USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists took on a proactive study that used a modified technique to look for bacteria with the _mcr-1_ gene, employing a targeted and extremely sensitive method to examine whole bacterial populations found in intestinal samples from food-producing animals. In the still-ongoing study, USDA scientists analyzed the samples by 1st exposing them to colistin at a concentration that would kill sensitive bacteria and allow any bacteria carrying _mcr-1_ to survive. Out of 949 animal samples screened so far, one strain of colistin-resistant _E. coli_ was found in a pig intestinal sample. The DNA sequence of this isolate revealed that the strain contained the _mcr-1_ gene on a plasmid. The scientists also determined that the _mcr-1_ carrying colistin-resistant _E. coli_ is resistant to other antibiotics including ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline.Second, HHS' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration used whole genome sequencing technology to search for the gene in salmonella, _E. coli_ and klebsiella taken from human and retail meat sources. As of April 2016, more than 44 000 salmonella and 9000 _E. coli_/shigella isolates from NARMS as well as the National Center for Biotechnology Information genomic database did not show the presence of the _mcr-1_ gene.Although the findings suggest that _mcr-1_-mediated colistin resistance might be rare, HHS and USDA remind consumers that cooking all meat, poultry and fish to its proper internal temperature kills bacteria, viruses and other foodborne pathogens, whether or not they are antibiotic-resistant.The NARMS partners will continue to study the newly isolated _E. coli_ strain to better understand the _mcr-1_ gene, as well as continue to analyze the remaining food animal samples for the presence of colistin resistance. Once USDA's ARS completes this study, the findings could help determine any additional steps necessary to further understand the mechanisms and dissemination of _mcr-1_ and associated genes.Beginning in fall 2016, CDC's Antibiotic Resistance lab network will provide the infrastructure and lab capacity for 7 to 8 regional labs, and labs in all states and 7 major cities/territories, to detect and respond to resistant organisms recovered from human samples. State labs will be able to detect new forms of antibiotic resistance -- including mutations that allow bacteria to survive the effects of the last-resort drugs like colistin -- and report these findings to CDC in near real-time. With this comprehensive lab capacity, state health labs and regional labs that are part of the network will be able to investigate emerging resistance in ways currently unavailable, generating better data for stronger infection control among patients to prevent and combat future resistance threats.And consistent with the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, CDC, FDA, USDA, DOD and other government agencies will continue efforts to track, slow and respond to the emergence of antibiotic resistance.The 2 detections of the _mcr-1_ gene in the U.S. provide a new clue into the antibiotic resistance landscape, and it also highlights how much we still do not understand. Colistin is rarely used in human medicine compared to other antibiotics. It is often used to treat multi-drug resistant infections and its use is increasing. It is not used in animals in this country. As such, the new detection underscores the urgent need for more research in this area, and that's why the President's 2017 budget request also calls for Congress to fund the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative at its full level, allowing our nation's best and brightest scientists to help the NARMS partners get ahead of the fight to keep antibiotics effective and available. Earlier this month [May 2016], USDA announced that it is seeking applications for USD 6 million in research funding to address antibiotic resistance through this program, but currently USDA must leave 9 in 10 applications for AFRI grants unfunded, keeping meaningful projects off the table.David J Smith, MD, is the deputy assistant secretary of defense for health readiness policy and oversight; Cathie Woteki, PhD, is USDA under secretary for research, education & economics; and Beth P Bell, MD MPH, is director of CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We now can add the USA to China, Canada, Algeria, Japan and a list of countries in Europe and South East Asia where the _mcr-1_ gene that encodes resistance to colistin has been found. Because the _mcr-1_ gene is located on a plasmid, it is capable of horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria of the same or even different species, linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other antibiotics. The _mcr-1_ gene was found to be located on an IncF plasmid. The IncF plasmid is a common plasmid type found in Enterobacteriaceae that encodes F pili, as well as virulence factors and resistance to multiple antibiotics (<http://aac.asm.org/content/53/6/2227.full>).
