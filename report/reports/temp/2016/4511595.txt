Becker's Hospital Review [edited]<http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/3-penn-medicine-heart-patients-infected-by-heater-cooler-devices-hundreds-to-be-notified.html>3 patients who underwent heart surgery at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia are being treated for nontuberculous mycobacterium [NTM] infections contracted from contaminated heater-cooler machines used during the surgery. A 4th patient tested positive for the bacteria, but has not displayed signs of infection. According The Philadelphia Inquirer, the addition of the 3 patients brings the total of such infections in the state of Pennsylvania to 20.Because of these infections, Penn Medicine is sending letters this month [September 2016] to hundreds of patients who may have been exposed to contaminated heater-cooler machines during major cardiac surgery.NTM can often be found in tap water and soil and pose little risk to healthy people. While benign in the environment, the microbes can incite infections in ill patients with open chest cavities. The bacteria also grow slowly, delaying symptoms of infection, but the infection is treatable. ""It can take years for them to develop,"" Sharon Watkins, PhD, an epidemiologist with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the Inquirer.Heater-cooler machines are used during open-heart surgery and use circulating water to modulate body temperature. The devices were previously thought safe because the water never comes into direct contact with the patient's blood. Infectious disease experts now believe small amounts of water can become aerosolized and emit via a vent in the device. The machines can also be very difficult to clean once contamination is detected -- the bacteria form a biofilm that is resilient against typical disinfectants. ""Once it's [the bacteria] in there,"" Patrick J. Brennan, MD, CMO of the University of Pennsylvania health system, told the Inquirer, ""it does not appear to be possible to get it out.""Heater-cooler machines have been implicated in other NTM infections recently. For instance, in October 2015, WellSpan York (Pennsylvania) Hospital began notifying approximately 1300 open-heart surgery patients of potential exposure to NTM from heater-cooler machines, and Penn State Hershey Medical Center did the same.In fact the Food and Drug Administration issued a safety communication about the devices in October last year [2015], and the CDC issued interim practical guidance on the heater-cooler machines.The devices may also house other bacteria. On 19 Sep [2016], University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle announced 3 of its heater-cooler machines tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria. The bacteria was previously detected in the hospital's water supply and has incited 4 cases of Legionnaires' disease -- a form of pneumonia -- in hospital patients. Two of the infected patients have died.[Byline: Brian Zimmerman]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion1@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.Heater-cooler units are used to cool blood in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. Contamination of the water circulating within these units has been the source of outbreaks of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (endocarditis, aortic root abscess, sternal wound infection or disseminated infection) following cardiothoracic surgery in the U.S. and Europe in the past several years (see prior ProMED-mail posts below). Swiss investigators at the University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich Heart Institute, concluded that airborne transmission of _Mycobacterium chimaera_, the NTM species that has been implicated in the European outbreaks, from contaminated heater-cooler unit water tanks, occurred during open-heart surgery (1). The species of NTM was not specified in the York, Pennsylvania outbreak in 2015, nor is the species specified in the current outbreak at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The exact types of NTM infections (for example, bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia, or surgical wound infection) in the 4 patients at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center are also not specified._Legionella pneumophila_ infection has recently been reported in 4 patients exposed during cardiac surgery to heater-cooler units contaminated with _Legionella_ at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle (see previous ProMED-mail post below).1.
