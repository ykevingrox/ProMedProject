His situation deteriorated after having been transferred to the Friendship Hospital where he died on Monday [20 Mar 2016].It's not known whether the health authorities of the country had or did not have any concept of the severity of his disease. It's known that Angola presently has an epidemic of yellow fever ongoing that has already killed [more than] 158 people.Yellow fever is a serious disease transmitted by insects that proliferate in standing water in dirty locations and places with waste.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is yet another case where a yellow fever virus infected individual traveled to a distant country in Africa.
