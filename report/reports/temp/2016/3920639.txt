Food Industry Mag [edited]<http://foodindustrymag.com/histamine-poisoning-link-to-cheddar/>Cheddar cheese, consumed by 5-year-olds at school, in products such as lasagne and macaroni cheese, has been identified as a potential source of food poisoning incidents associated with a compound called histamine, which can form during cheese ripening.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Often the term scombroid poisoning is referred to the syndrome associated with certain fish as noted below.The formal posting can be found at <http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Food-Safety/Cheddar-linked-to-food-poisoning-among-children> but it is copyrighted and cannot be copied. It does not contain specifics of when, where and how many children were affected.Two good reviews on the subject can be found at:Taylor SL, Stratton JE, Nordlee JA: Histamine poisoning (scombroid fish poisoning): an allergy-like intoxication. J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 1989;27:225-240.Abstract--------Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses, that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families, Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (e.g. tuna, mackerel, bonito), are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term, ""scombroid fish poisoning"", to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions, cheeses especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 h. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid, histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on insuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk.Hungerford JM: Scombroid poisoning: a review.
