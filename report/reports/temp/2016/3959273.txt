The Guardian (Nigeria) [edited]<http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2016/01/why-we-cant-tackle-lassa-fever-like-ebola-minister/>Health minister Professor Isaac Adewole has lamented what he described as the culture of silence permeating the Nigerian society in reaction to the outbreak of Lassa fever pandemic in the country. Speaking to State House correspondents at the presidential villa on [Wed 20 Jan 2016], the minister cited the case of Ebonyi State, which had so far recorded about 5 cases of Lassa fever but never cared to report [to] his ministry for necessary action.The minister denied that cases of Lassa fever were hidden, but admitted they were not brought to the public knowledge until it became late. His words, ""Not that they were hidden but they were never brought to public knowledge. There is also what we can consider to be culture of silence in some of our states. For example, we recognised Ebonyi State as one of the endemic states.""And since the outbreak, Ebonyi has not recorded a single case or reported a single case. We dispatched our surveillance team to Ebonyi and we discovered 5 cases. We are not having a resurgence. What we had over the years is a situation which Lassa is endemic in Nigeria. And as I said on numerous occasions, we have these outbreaks. In 2012, we had the highest. We had 1700 case and that declined. Last year [2015], we had 441 cases. And what has happened is that for the 1st time in the history of the country, we are being transparent and open and we are telling the entire world what the situation is and that is what is different. We are also concerned. We want to find out why we are still having this Lassa fever in spite of human and material resources that we have in this country. We inaugurated a Lassa fever eradication committee chaired by one of the foremost virologists in this country and we are committed to signing the obituary of the Lassa fever this year [2016].""Explaining why the war against Lassa fever may not be fought the way the country tackled Ebola, the minister said the source of Ebola in Nigeria was traced to one person that imported it into the country. According to him, ""We cannot win the battle against Lassa fever the same way we won the one against Ebola. Ebola happened to be a single importation to Nigeria. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria. In 2012, we had upsurge in 26 states. So, it is there but I can assure you that with what we put in place this year [2016], we will sign it off.""He said the federal government was determined to get to the root of the issue saying, ""What we want to do is put across some innovative funding mechanisms, ability to manage and put to use 10 000 primary health care centres across the country over the next 2 years. In the next 100 days, we will flag off 110 of these centres. ""We will start with the one in Fuka where we first had this outbreak. We will do one per senatorial district, 109 to make 110 in 100 days. This year [2016] alone, we will do 5000.""[byline: Mohammed Abubakar]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There is no mention of the rodent reservoir. A promise of 5000 new rural health centers to do what? Where will be the lab support for the hundreds of specimens that will be pouring in? Labs have to be secure just like Ebola labs. And what care can a health center offer? Treatment is intravenous ribavirin 3-4 x daily for 10 days! Patients must be isolated and HCWs [health care workers] attending them wear PPE [personal protection equipment], all waste must be incinerated, and bodies given safe burial the same way Ebola cases are treated. - Mod.JWThe minister's statement that Lassa fever and Ebola require different approaches for prevention and control is correct. The minister stated that the goal is eradication of Lassa fever. This is not possible currently. Although additional support of the health care centers will provide for additional patient care, prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir. The reservoir of the virus is the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians.Images of mastomys mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
