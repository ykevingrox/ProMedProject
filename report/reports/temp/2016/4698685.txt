Africa Review [edited]<http://www.africareview.com/news/Bubonic-plague-kills-scores-in-southern-Madagascar/979180-3477216-format-xhtml-3mnm8z/index.html>Bubonic plague has killed at least 31 people in Madagascar's southern district of Befotaka Atsimo, an official said. ""The victims are from 2 adjacent rural communes: 25 in one and 6 in another one,"" said local lawmaker Col Maroriky. The lawmaker said the affected areas were remote and prone to diseases and insecurity.Reports of a mysterious disease outbreak first emerged last week but it has now been confirmed as bubonic plague. Bush fires, blamed on persistent drought, have reportedly driven disease carrying rodents into villages, where they have transmitted the disease to humans. The outbreak has been aggravated by the poor local health infrastructure.Medical experts from the Health Ministry and the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar in Antananarivo were deployed to the affected area on Mon 5 Dec 2016. However, the bad roads from the regional capital city of Vangaindrano were reportedly impeding access to the affected populations.[Byline: Rivonala Razafison]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Mon 5 Dec 2016, 8:35 AMSource: L'Express de Madagascar [in French, machine trans., edited]<http://www.lexpressmada.com/blog/actualites/befotaka-atsimo-des-suspicions-de-peste>It is suspected that plague could have caused deaths in Befotaka Atsimo. Elements of the Ministry of Public Health have been dispatched to this non-plague area. Authorities in the Befotaka Atsimo district and the Midongy Atsimo district have reported suspicious deaths in Inosy Ambalarano commune, Befotaka Atsimo district, in the Atsimo Atsinanana region this weekend. The victims had the same symptoms, namely [swollen] lymph nodes, such as those of bubonic plague. The exact statistics of the deceased escape from these sources. The brigade commander of the Befotaka gendarmerie Atsimo, a reliable source, reported 2 deaths. ""Our people did not see these bodies,"" said a source from the police.Another source in Midongy Atsimo, the district closest to the scene of the drama, reported dozens of deaths in 2 months. ""We have heard about people who died for unknown causes in Ambalarano 2 months ago. The inhabitants of this commune who come to shop in Midongy Atsimo speak of it, but they believe that it is due to the sorcery"", it is explained.Maroriky, deputy of the district of Befotaka Atsimo, meanwhile, reported a dozen deaths. These figures came from the elements of the civil security of this small town which informed him of this drama, 4 days before. For now, everything is unclear as to the cause of the disease and the exact number of deaths.Teams from the Ministry of Public Health and the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar were dispatched to the site. They left the central office on with all the necessary inputs to diagnose the causes of death and to treat the sick. ""It is a very inaccessible area. These teams, composed of about 20 people, will have to travel about 30 kilometers on foot before arriving at the site, in this district classified [as] red zone, ""explains Dr. Maherisoa Ratsitorahina, director of the Health Watch and epidemiological surveillance of the Ministry of Public Health.[Byline: Miangaly Ralitera]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.The following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998;4(1):101-4, PMID: 9452403; <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm>).""Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.""Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the ""black plague"" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997;337(10):677-80, PMID: 9278464; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004>). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread.Atsimo-Atsinanana (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsimo-Atsinanana>) is a region in Madagascar. The region used to be part of the Fianarantsoa Province. The region extends along the southern part of the east coast of Madagascar. It is bordered by Vatovavy-Fitovinany and Haute Matsiatra (North), Ihorombe (West) and Anosy (South).
