Since April, there have been cases in Nelson [South Island], Horowhenua, and Northland [North Island].Measles is a highly infectious and potentially life threatening disease that spreads quickly.People who have shared the same air as someone that is infectious with measles may be at risk of developing the disease if they are not already immune.""Symptoms of measles can include fever, runny nose, and sore, watery, red eyes that can last for several days before a red blotchy rash appears,"" Simmons said.""People are infectious from 5 days before the rash appears to 5 days after. Complications are common with measles and about one in 10 people will need hospital treatment.""Anyone with symptoms of measles should call ahead before visiting their family doctor, after-hours clinic or emergency department, so that steps can be taken to reduce the risk of infecting others in the waiting room.""Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease and anyone who has had at least 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination is considered immune.People most at risk of contracting the disease are those who have either not had the vaccine, or who have just had one dose of the vaccine.""Now is the time to consider if you are immune to measles or not. I urge people to ensure they are fully immunised as this is the best way for people to protect themselves and others against measles and it is free to those who need it,"" Simmons said.General information on measles is available from the Ministry of Health website at <http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/measles>.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at <http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5929>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
