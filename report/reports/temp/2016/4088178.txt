Schools Week [edited]<http://schoolsweek.co.uk/warnings-over-scarlet-fever-outbreaks-in-schools/>Teachers are being reminded to be vigilant in the wake of a rise in outbreaks of scarlet fever. Schools should keep infected pupils and staff away for the 1st 24 hours of treatment, health bosses have said.There are between 3000 and 4000 cases of the bacterial disease each year, but Public Health England (PHE) has reported a rise in recent months. Outbreaks in schools have been reported by local press in Norwich, Banbury and Nantwich.PHE received 4701 notifications of scarlet fever between early September 2015 and mid-February 2016, compared to 3399 in the same period last year -- an increase of 38 per cent.Government guidance from 2014 states the disease initially causes headaches, sore throats, fever, nausea and vomiting and goes on to form a red, generalised pinhead rash, which gives skin a sandpaper-like texture. Complications can include pneumonia, sinusitis or meningitis in the early stages and acute glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever at a later stage. Doctors recommend prompt treatment.PHE warned that the disease, which is most likely to occur in children under 10, can spread quickly in schools, It reminded leaders to report cases to local health protection teams and keep infected people away for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment begins. The advice goes on to say: ""Good hygiene practice such as hand-washing remains the most important step in preventing and controlling spread of infection.""[Byline: Freddie Whittaker]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The above news report says that local press in Norwich, Banbury and Nantwich has reported outbreaks of scarlet fever in schools.

There have been 33 suspected cases in Surrey in just 4 weeks -- 43.5 percent higher than the same period last year [2015].Medics have now warned parents to remain vigilant to prevent an outbreak of the highly contagious disease across the UK. All boroughs in Surrey have been affected by the disease, with Reigate and Banstead the worst hit with 11 cases.While the illness is marked by a pink-red sandpapery rash, parents are warned not to assume it is scarlet fever -- as this could also be a sign of deadly meningitis. Dr Ivan Ratnayake of the Ashley Centre Surgery in Epsom, said: ""The rash seen with scarlet fever can mimic that of meningitis -- and it's hard to diagnose over the phone. ""I would always encourage parents, if they spot the symptoms, to get their child seen by a doctor. I wouldn't even discourage them to go to the hospital if they can't be seen by a GP immediately -- you want to get your child looked at as soon as possible.[Byline: Ellie Flynn]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Surrey is a county in the southeast of England, bordering Greater London, and is divided into 11 districts; Reigate and Banstead is a local government district in Surrey (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey>).
