Rising Kashmir [edited]<http://www.risingkashmir.com/news/south-kashmir-on-high-alert-as-viral-hepatitis-spreads-fast/>South Kashmir is experiencing nearly daily increase in new hepatitis E [virus, HEV] cases due to contaminated water. The health officials are apprehensive that the situation may get worse, prompting the Divisional Administration to closely monitor the rate of infection to identify potential clusters of disease. Officials said the number of suspected HEV cases jumped to over 100 in Kulgam district alone, about 40 miles [64 km] south of summer capital Srinagar. That number includes 8 confirmed cases in Qazigund area. Following the disclosure by health officials in a high-level meeting, Divisional Commissioner, Asgar Samoon, has put all the hospitals on high alert in south Kashmir.Sources told Rising Kashmir that Samoon lashed out at PHE [Public Health Engineering] officials for supplying contaminated water in Kulgam district. ""They have been asked to take the precautionary measures immediately and chlorinate the water reservoirs. Divisional Commissioner also instructed the Rural Sanitation Department to construct dry latrines in the areas which will prevent contamination of water through open defecation,"" said officials privy to Monday's [29 Feb 2016] meeting. Divisional Commissioner has also constituted a team of experts from Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar and Directorate of Health Services (DHS) Kashmir to monitor the situation in the region to stop the spread of infection.Last week [week of 22 Feb 2016] the doctors confirmed outbreak of hepatitis E at Cheki-Wangund village of Qazigund, attributing it to the supply of highly contaminated water to the inhabitants by the Public Health Engineering (PHE) department. The lab reports also confirmed that water supplied to the villagers is not fit for human consumption at all. According to reports, 8 people in the village have been tested positive for the infection so far. It said 35 people were found to have jaundice and their blood samples were taken for testing to Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) laboratory at Barzulla, Srinagar. Out of 35, 8 have so far tested positive for HEV infection while the reports of other suspected cases are awaited.[Byline: Manzoor-ul-Hassan]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population older than 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html>). - Mod.LLMaps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/305>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
