ot identified******[1] Taiwan, ferret-badger, human exposureDate: Tue 22 Nov 2016, 1:39 PMSource: CNA via FocusTaiwan [edited]<http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201611220008.aspx>A resident in the eastern county of Hualien was recently bitten by a wild ferret-badger with rabies, the 9th such case reported this year [2016], the Council of Agriculture (COA) said on Tue [22 Nov 2016]. The incident occurred on 17 Nov 2016, when the animal broke into the victim's home in Fengbin Township, according to the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine. The victim sought medical attention immediately and was given a rabies vaccine injection as a precaution, the bureau said.The ferret-badger died 2 days after it was isolated at a local animal quarantine station, and tests of the animal confirmed it had been infected with rabies, the bureau said.Statistics compiled by the bureau show that since 2013, 549 rabies cases -- including 38 cases this year [2016] -- have been reported in 76 townships in 9 counties and cities around Taiwan.The disease has been confined mainly to wild ferret-badgers, with only a few cases involving masked palm civets. The bureau urged the public to be on alert and avoid contact with wild animals. The disease resurfaced in Taiwan in 2013 after an absence lasting from at least 1961.[byline: Chen Cheng-wei and Y.F.

Molecular characterization of cryptically circulating rabies virus from ferret badgers, Taiwan. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014;20(5):790-8. doi: 10.3201/eid2005.131389, PMID: 24751120Abstract--------After the last reported cases of rabies in a human in 1959 and a nonhuman animal in 1961, Taiwan was considered free from rabies. However, during 2012-2013, an outbreak occurred among ferret badgers in Taiwan. To examine the origin of this virus strain, we sequenced 3 complete genomes and acquired multiple rabies virus (RABV) nucleoprotein and glycoprotein sequences. Phylogeographic analyses demonstrated that the RABV affecting the Taiwan ferret badgers (RABV-TWFB) is a distinct lineage within the group of lineages from Asia and that it has been differentiated from its closest lineages, China I (including isolates from Chinese ferret badgers) and the Philippines, 158-210 years ago. The most recent common ancestor of RABV-TWFB originated 91-113 years ago. Our findings indicate that RABV could be cryptically circulating in the environment. An understanding of the underlying mechanism might shed light on the complex interaction between RABV and its host. - Mod.AS]******[2] Philippines, Davao, canine/feline control programDate: Sun 20 Nov 2016Source: Sunstar Davao [edited]<http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/local-news/2016/11/20/davao-city-vet-vaccinates-104000-dogs-cats-510614>THE Davao city veterinarian's office (CVO) on Sun 20 Nov 2016, reported that 104 731 dogs and cats have been vaccinated in Davao City from January to September [2016] in line with its campaign to eliminate rabies in 2020. City veterinarian Dr Noel Martin said the office and its 11 districts also served 62 435 clients within just 9 months, which is a progress as compared to last year's [2015] record. Based on the Rabies Prevention and Control Program accomplishment report, CVO only noted 55 306 animals and/or pets were vaccinated and 34 100 clients served in 2015.Martin attributed such accomplishment to the efforts of the city government to eliminate rabies. He said the office is constantly conducting information drive on responsible pet ownership in every barangay. Martin, however, urged all concerned pet owners to have their pet dogs and/or cats immunized by a veterinarian at 3 months old and every year thereafter. He added that pet owners must take care of their pets by bathing, giving clean food and clean sleeping quarters, and undergoing regular check-up at the veterinarian's clinic to prevent any disease.[byline: Ivy C Tejano]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Nepal, fox, dog, human exposureDate: Wed 9 Nov 2016From: Sher Bahadur Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]On 5 Nov 2016, an aggressive fox had bitten about 12 residents of Malangwa, Sarlahi district of Nepal. The next day, 1 victim was referred to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) for administration of the rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) due to severe bite injuries (nose, upper lip). On the same day, 5 dogs (stray) attacked victims from Parsa district (from 2 different locations, but same fox) also visited STIDH for RIG administration. As many as 3 other victims who had minor injuries did not refer to the STIDH (for RIG administration). Both the fox and the dogs, suspected as rabid, were killed by local residents.Earlier, in Oct 2016, of the 17 fox bite victims (from Garuda Village Development Committee, Rautahat district), 2 had died of rabies despite rabies immunoglobulin treatment; another 1 died on 4 Nov 2016 [ProMED-mail archive, ProMED-SoAs, archive no.20161027.4586676].

The animal being unable to fly, scientists quickly suspected a case of rabies. Upon confirmation of the diagnosis, a post-exposure vaccine treatment was given to the walker who had been bitten on the thumb. With treatment, his life was never in danger.Rabies is a zoonosis -- an animal disease capable of infecting humans -- mainly affecting dogs and some wild carnivores such as foxes or raccoons. The only known zoonotic disease associated with bats in Belgium is the 'European Bat lyssavirus', a virus similar to the classical rabies. [This virus] had occasionally been identified in a small number of bats in our neighboring countries (France, Netherlands, Germany, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg). The diagnosis made by the ISP is the first confirmation of the presence of the virus in Belgium.All strictly protected European species of bats are not a threat to public and [animal] health. Moreover, bats never try to approach humans, and [the only way] an infected [bat] can transmit rabies to humans is if bitten, scratched, or if its saliva comes in contact with a wound.You should never handle bats with bare hands, much less if it appears sick. If bitten, a GP should be consulted immediately.Rabies in western Europe [...] is essentially an imported disease. In Belgium the last indigenous case of rabies in humans predates 1930. Belgium was declared free of rabies by WHO in 2001, after an intensive campaign of oral vaccination of foxes who were the reservoir and vector [of the] disease from 1966 to 1999. Since the elimination of fox rabies, Belgium has had only 2 imported cases of canine rabies in 2007 and 2008. Thanks to intensive surveillance, Belgium regained its status indemnity 6 months after each incident.[byline: Robert Herriman]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] India (Gujarat).

The injured persons were rushed to the community health centre in Bilkha where they were administered anti-rabies injections.""We received over a dozen patients bitten by the same rabid dog. We gave them primary treatment and asked the patients to take vaccination from the government hospital in Junagadh in the next 72 hours as a precautionary measure,"" said Dr D K Ramani, community health centre in-charge at Bilkha.There was no confirmation on the rabid dog being alive or being captured.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[6] Zimbabwe, human, source not identifiedDate: Sat 12 Nov 2016Source: Newsday (Zimbabwe) [edited]<https://www.newsday.co.zw/2016/11/12/rabies-claims-4-hurungwe/>An outbreak of rabies has claimed 4 lives in Hurungwe district, NewsDay has established. Mashonaland West acting provincial medical director Justice Mudavanhu confirmed that 1 person died in Karoi town, while 3 of the deaths were recorded at Chidamoyo Hospital, 75 km [about 46 mi] away.""The woman who passed on in Karoi was already symptomatic after spending a few days at home without medication and it was too late for health officials to save her life,"" Mudavanhu told NewsDay Weekender recently.He said one young boy, suspected to have contracted the disease, was also battling for his life at Karoi Hospital. ""We have a young boy, son to the deceased who is suspected to been infected, but clinically has no signs. We are closely monitoring his condition and we have since advised and recommended vaccination,"" Mudavanhu said.Rabies is an infectious viral disease that is almost always fatal following the onset of clinical signs. According to the World Health Organization, people are usually infected following a deep bite or scratch by an infected animal with dogs being the main host and transmitter of rabies.Karoi district veterinary department officials referred questions to their provincial bosses in Chinhoyi. But Mudavanhu confirmed the Health ministry was now working with Vet Department in advocacy and campaign to eradicate rabies through vaccination of pets including dogs and cats in the district that covers 22 outlaying clinics and Karoi town. ""We are working with officers from vet department where they are asking as little as 1USD to vaccinate a dog or cat and this will help in curbing rabies from spreading,"" Mudavanhu said.[byline: Nhau Mangirazi]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[7] Algeria, cattle. Source not identifiedDate: Mon 7 Nov 2016Source: La DÌ©pÌ»che de Kabylie [in French, trans. Mod.AB, edited]<http://www.depechedekabylie.com/national/168920-panique-chez-les-eleveurs-de-bovins.html>Panic arose among cattle owners of the municipality of Aghbalou [BouÌøra province], particularly those on transhumance in community pastures, after 2 adult cattle and 2 young bulls were found rabid.This deadly and contagious zoonotic disease was detected on [27 and 28 Oct 2016] and 2 cows were immediately culled and buried with their corpses covered by lime, the usual method to reduce the risk of contamination. A veterinary report notifying these cases was forwarded to the management of agricultural services through agricultural subdivision of M'Chedallah [BouÌøra]. Unfortunately, the report gave only a description of the disease, and the heads of the sick animal were not sent to the Draa Ben Khedda laboratory [in Tizi Ouzou Province of northern Algeria] for analysis because of the lack of adequate medical equipment including large volume coolers.The other 2 cases occurred in young bulls of which 1 is still alive and was isolated from the herd. The private veterinarian who diagnosed these 2 rabies outbreaks said that ""all rabies symptoms manifested themselves in these animals: vigorous stirring, intense salivation and drooling, unbalanced walking, and finally total paralysis of the animal.""The mayor of this municipality is also extremely concerned as each of the 2 affected herds has more than 40 cattle heads and, the regulatory measure, in this case, is the mandatory quarantine of the whole herd. Indeed, livestock must be kept in pens and should not be allowed to leave the premises. However, none of the farmers can feed as many cattle during this confinement period of 3 months. After this isolation comes sequestration phase which lasts 1 year, during which the animals must be kept locked and under surveillance and daily control. It also should be noted that during this period it is prohibited to sell or dispose of such animals.The unfortunate farmers currently face a dilemma because not being able to meet the costs of feeding their herds during this period, especially in the mountains, and with the onset of winter and snow, it is almost impossible to feed the animals on site. There are nearly a 100 heads, which are thus condemned to starvation for those who will not be struck down by rabies.The veterinarian practicing in Takerboust [BouÌøra] and following this matter closely, is categorical, ""the rabies virus was transmitted by stray dogs, a major vector in the transmission of the disease, which roam freely among the cows in the collective pastures,"" she says, wishing an urgent dog slaughter campaign to reduce the risk of widespread contamination.We learned, moreover, that this zoonosis manifested after the campaign of vaccination of cattle whose range includes rabies vaccines and the anti-sheep pox [sheep pox does not affect cattle. - Mod.AB]. This situation is a challenge to the DSA [Directorate of Agricultural Services] to neutralize the virus and avoid the deaths of these cows and the transmission of the disease to humans.[byline: Oulaid Soualah]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These bovine rabies cases appeared in animals on collective grazing during winter transhumance. These animals were vaccinated against rabies before the outbreaks but the article does not specify the exact date of vaccination.Rabies legislation in Algeria seems very constraining in such a case. It is constraining for farmers who must observe a quarantine period of 3 months, followed by a 1-year sequestration period, during which they have to feed them in the barn. It is also constraining for veterinary services that are required to make daily inspection of these animals. The fight against stray dogs is necessary to prevent new cases, especially in young animals or those who escaped the last rabies vaccination.Maps of Algeria can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Algeria.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13434>.
