WHO Emergencies, Yellow Fever Situation Report [edited]<http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/situation-reports/15-july-2016/en/>Summary-------Angola: 3625 suspected casesIn Angola, as of 8 Jul 2016 a total of 3625 suspected cases have been reported, of which 876 are confirmed. The total number of reported deaths is 357, of which 117 were reported among confirmed cases. Suspected cases have been reported in all 18 provinces and confirmed cases have been reported in 16 of 18 provinces and 80 of 125 reporting districts.Mass reactive vaccination campaigns 1st began in Luanda and have now expanded to cover most of the other affected parts of Angola. Recently, the campaigns have focused on border areas. Despite extensive vaccination efforts circulation of the virus persists.11 reactive and pre-emptive mass vaccination campaigns are ongoing in several districts in Benguela, Huambo, Huila, Kwanza Norte, Kwanza Sul, Lunda Norte and Uige provinces; 6 other mass vaccination campaigns are nearing completion. Mop-up campaigns are being implemented in parts of the provinces of Cunene, Lunda Norte, Uige and Zaire.Democratic Republic of the Congo: 1798 suspected casesOther than an increase in the number of suspected cases recently reported, there are no updates regarding the epidemiological situation in the Democratic Republic of The Congo (DRC). For the last 3 weeks the national laboratory in DRC has been unable to confirm or discard any suspected cases of yellow fever due to technical issues. According to the latest available information (as of 11 Jul [2016]), the total number of notified suspected cases is 1798, with 68 confirmed cases (as of 24 Jun [2016]) and 85 reported deaths. Cases have been reported in 22 health zones in 5 of 26 provinces. Of the 68 confirmed cases, 59 were imported from Angola, 2 are sylvatic (not related to the outbreak) and 7 are autochthonous.In DRC, surveillance efforts have increased and vaccination campaigns have centred on affected health zones in Kinshasa and Kongo Central. Reactive vaccination campaigns will start on 20 Jul, in Kisenso health zone in Kinshasa province and in Kahemba, Kajiji and Kisandji health zones in Kwango province.The risk of spread2 additional countries have reported confirmed yellow fever cases imported from Angola: Kenya (2 cases) and People's Republic of China (11 cases). These cases highlight the risk of international spread through non-immunised travellers.7 countries (Brazil, Chad, Colombia, Ghana, Guinea, Peru and Uganda) are currently reporting yellow fever outbreaks or sporadic cases not linked to the Angolan outbreak.VaccinationWHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization reviewed existing evidence that demonstrates that using 1/5 of a standard vaccine dose would still provide protection against the disease for at least 12 months and possibly longer. This approach, known as fractional dosing, is under consideration as a short-term measure, in the context of a potential vaccine shortage in emergencies.Risk assessmentThe outbreak in Angola remains of high concern due to:- Persistent local transmission despite the fact that approximately 15 million people have been vaccinated;- Local transmission has been reported in 12 highly populated provinces including Luanda.- The continued extension of the outbreak to new provinces and new districts.- High risk of spread to neighbouring countries. As the borders are porous with substantial cross-border social and economic activities, further transmission cannot be excluded. Viraemic travelling patients pose a risk for the establishment of local transmission especially in countries where adequate vectors and susceptible human populations are present;- Risk of establishment of local transmission in other provinces where no autochthonous cases are reported;- High index of suspicion of ongoing transmission in hard-to-reach areas like Cabinda;In DRC, the outbreak has spread to 3 provinces. Given the limited availability of vaccines, the large Angolan community in Kinshasa, the porous border between Angola and DRC, and the presence and the activity of the vector _Aedes_ in the country, the outbreak might extend to other provinces, in particular Kasai, Kasai Central and Lualaba.The virus in Angola and DRC is largely concentrated in main cities; however, there is a high risk of spread and local transmission to other provinces in both countries. In addition, the risk is high for potential spread to bordering countries, especially those classified as low-risk (i.e. Namibia, Zambia) and where the population, travelers and foreign workers are not vaccinated for yellow fever.Some African countries (Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Republic of Congo and Uganda) and some countries in South America (Brazil, Colombia and Peru) have reported cases of yellow fever in 2016. These events are not related to the Angolan outbreak, but there remains a need for vaccines in those countries, which poses additional strain on the limited global yellow fever vaccine stockpile.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Congo DRDate: Fri 15 Jul 2016Source: Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-yellowfever-congo-idUSKCN0ZV29R>The number of suspected yellow fever cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo has jumped 38 percent in the last 3 weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday [15 Jul 2016], as health officials prepare to launch a vaccination campaign next week.Congo's government last month [June 2016] declared a yellow fever epidemic in the capital Kinshasa and 2 provinces that border Angola, where the worst outbreak of the disease in decades has killed about 350 people.As of 11 Jul [2016], Congo had recorded 1798 suspected cases since the start of the outbreak in January [2016], WHO said in a weekly report, up from 1307 on 24 Jun [2016]; 75 people are believed to have died from the disease in Congo, it said.Officials have confirmed 68 cases. But they have not been able to confirm or rule out any additional cases for the last 3 weeks due to a technical problem shipping a chemical used in the tests, said WHO's resident representative in Congo, Yokouide Allarangar.However, the issue has now been resolved and new test results will be available in the coming days, Allarangar added.Health authorities plan to administer 1 million doses of yellow fever vaccine during a 10-day campaign beginning on Wednesday [20 Jul 2016] in the Kinshasa district of Kisenso and the neighboring Kwango province.Due to a global shortage of vaccines, plans to inoculate some 10 million more people in Kinshasa and along the Angolan border have been put on hold until August [2016], when newly-manufactured doses from Brazil are expected to begin arriving.[Reporting by Aaron Ross; editing by Kevin Liffey]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The situation in the DR Congo is particularly worrisome because of the declared epidemic in Kinshasa, a densely populated city with reportedly abundant mosquito vectors. The 1 million doses will be helpful, but would cover 1/10th of the 11 million inhabitants if the standard dose is used. If the 1/5 dose is implemented, 90 percent of the population could be covered. Waiting until new stocks of vaccine are delivered in August gives the virus a 3 or more week head start.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY]
