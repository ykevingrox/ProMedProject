He added that the anti-diphtheria serum (ADS) cost for one patient is Rs 30 000 [about USD 286] but the government was providing the treatment to all patients free of cost, adding that KP government has purchased around USD 52 000 worth of treatment from Russia and if needed, more will be purchased. He informs that drugs for diphtheria treatment are prepared only in India, Croatia, and Russia, adding that they have already purchased the drug from Russia for the treatment of diphtheria.About the measles cases reported in the province in 2016, he said that the numbers were alarming as around 9000 suspected measles cases were reported across the province. He informed that most affected district was Peshawar and although it is the capital of the province, the district reported around 2600 measles cases.Similarly, in Charsadda district around 1000 cases, in DI Khan 700 cases, in Nowshera 400 cases, and in Swat 450 measles cases, adding that cases were also reported in other districts.He added that around 13 000 lady health workers were in the province while the provincial government has recruited more than 500 vaccinators, but still routine immunization and vaccination were poor and emergency steps should be taken to improve them.He lamented that the Expanded Program of Immunization was working in the province but they should focus on the routine immunization, adding that the provincial government has already announced a health emergency in the province but practical steps should be taken so that we save our generation.[Byline: Wisal Mashal]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In 1974, WHO established the Expanded Programme on Immunization to ensure that all children had access to routinely recommended vaccines. Global coverage with the 3rd dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP3) was less than 5 percent in 1974 and increased to 79 percent by 2005; however, more than 1/5 of the world's children, especially those in low-income countries, were still not fully vaccinated (<http://apps.who.int/wer/2012/wer8744.pdf>).In 2005, WHO and UNICEF developed the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS) to improve national immunization programmes and decrease morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine preventable diseases. One goal of the strategy was that all countries achieve and sustain 90 percent national DTP3 coverage. This report summarizes global routine vaccination coverage during 2011. An estimated 83 percent of infants worldwide received at least 3 doses of DTP vaccine in 2011, similar to coverage in 2009 (83 percent) and 2010 (84 percent). Among 194 WHO member states, 130 (67 percent) achieved 90 percent or more national DTP3 coverage. However, 22.4 million children were incompletely vaccinated at 12 months of age and remained at risk for vaccine-preventable morbidity and mortality.Strengthening routine immunization services, especially in countries with the greatest number of under-vaccinated children, should be a global priority to help achieve the 4th Millennium Development Goal, to reduce mortality among children younger than 5 years of age by 2/3 from 1990 to 2015. Vaccination coverage is calculated as the percentage of those in the target age group who received a dose of a recommended vaccine by a given age. DTP3 coverage by age 12 months is a major indicator of immunization programme performance, but coverage with other vaccines, such as 3rd dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV3) or 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) is also considered.The case numbers for these 2 vaccine preventable diseases in the report above are quite high, which indicates the need for concerted efforts towards improved immunization coverage as recommended by Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/>):- integrating immunization with other health services, such as postnatal care for mothers and babies;- strengthening health systems so that vaccines continue to be given even in times of crisis; and- ensuring that everyone can access vaccines and afford to pay for them- Mod.UBAMaps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://pakistanmap.facts.co/pakistanmapof/PakistanAdministrativeMap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19537>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
