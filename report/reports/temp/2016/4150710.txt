Bahrain MOH Instagram [mach. translations, edited]<https://www.instagram.com/p/BECEnQNq6LR/>The Department of Public Health, Ministry of Health [Bahrain] revealed that an examination of 54 samples taken from contacts of the Saudi patient in the Mohammed bin Khalifa heart hospital who was infected with the coronavirus were run by the Public Health Laboratory and, thankfully, were negative for infection with the coronavirus.According to the Ministry of Health, since the identification of the coronavirus on Saturday [9 Apr 2016], there has been coordination between the Royal Medical services and the Ministry of Health and the Mohammed bin Khalifa Heart Center for communication with all relevant parties in order to follow the evolution of the virus and working to limit its spread, and develop a plan to cope with the coronavirus and activating the role of medical staff to deal with this virus in order to ensure the safety of citizens, residents and all employees in the health sector in the Kingdom of Bahrain.In addition, the necessary instructions were given to all heads of departments of health facilities in Bahrain to follow up the developments of the virus and coordination with the Ministry of Health official, media and authorities in Bahrain.On the other hand, in cooperation between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there will be continuous coordination to combat the coronavirus that causes MERS [Middle East respiratory syndrome], which was detected recently in a Saudi patient who underwent open-heart surgery at the Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa specialty Center heart operations. A Saudi medical team specializing in anti-coronavirus visited the Kingdom of Bahrain to provide expertise and advice and to look at preparations being taken to eliminate this virus and work on preventing transmission in the healthcare facility. [Apparently, there are plans to transfer the patient as soon as he is considered to be in stable condition.]It is worth mentioning that according to the internationally applicable system for evaluating patients and processing laboratory specimens, investigations revealed that the patient had a positive history of contact with camels and was positive for MERS-CoV infection through testing by the Public Health laboratory in Bahrain. Accordingly, the patient was put into isolation, and testing for MERS-CoV was performed on all staff of the hospital [and patients that were known to have had contact with the infected patient. Fortunately all tests were negative].The Ministry of Public Health assured the population that the country is fully prepared to confront and contain the disease and has coordinated with all relevant parties in Bahrain to address the virus through contingency plans pursued in coordination with WHO global recommendations.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st time MERS-CoV infection has been confirmed by Bahrain. From the above Instagram, it appears as though the patient was a Saudi National undergoing open heart surgery in Bahrain. The MERS-CoV infected patient had a history of contact with camels, presumably in the 14 days preceding onset of symptoms, although a description of clinical illness/symptoms was not provided in the Bahraini MOH Instagram information. Information as to why the MERS-CoV test was performed on this patient was not easily discernible through the machine translation of the Instagram. We await more information as it becomes available.The Kingdom of Bahrain is a country that is an archipelago made up of approximately 30 islands near the western shores of the Persian Gulf. Bahrain Island is the largest landmass, at 55 km (34 miles) long by 18 km (11 miles) wide. Saudi Arabia lies to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the King Fahd Causeway, while Iran lies 200 km (124 miles) to the north across the Persian Gulf.

Since 1 Apr 2016, cases have been reported from Buraidah, Alkharj, Najran, Abha and Dammam.Locations of newly reported cases, deaths and recoveries can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/127>.]
