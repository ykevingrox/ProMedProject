Nation [edited]<http://www.nation.co.ke/news/United-Nation-ebola/-/1056/3208960/-/7djm9iz/-/index.html>In the dark days of October 2014, an unprecedented Ebola epidemic wreaked havoc across Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. In Sierra Leone, the health system was only weeks away from total collapse due to an inability to manage or pay health workers across the country, and the world braced for the unchecked spread of the disease throughout west Africa.In the face of an apocalyptic scenario, a company made up of local hackers took on the unprecedented challenge of building, implementing and running a huge Management Information System and Mobile Payments System to keep the health system from collapsing. This talk will show how this was achieved with Open Source Software, secondhand laptops, hacked voter registration machines, secondhand smartphones, and some very smart and determined young people used to achieving great things with none of the resources we take for granted. We salute them.The video is available at:<https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7561-how_open_source_software_second_hand_laptops_and_hackers_helped_stop_ebola_and_stopped_an_apocalypse>.--Communicated by:Florian BurckhardtEpidemiologeArbeitsbereich Infektionsschutz und Epidemiologie Institut fÌ r Hygiene und Infektionsschutz in LandauAbteilung HumanmedizinLANDESUNTERSUCHUNGSAMTBodelschwinghstr. 19 åÊD - 76829 Landau<Florian.Burckhardt@lua.rlp.de>[ProMED thanks Dr. Burckhardt for sending the link to the video. - Mod.LK]******[2] Guinea, diagnostic assay1 Jun 2016 UN: Latest Ebola outbreak in Guinea is now over.<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_MED_GUINEA_EBOLA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-06-01-10-55-52>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the latest Ebola transmission outbreak in Guinea has ended, and the country is now entering a 90-day heightened surveillance period to monitor for any unexpected cases.In a statement on Wed [1 Jun 2016], WHO said the source of infection in Guinea's recent outbreak was likely ""due to exposure to infected (bodily) fluid from an Ebola survivor.""The UN warned that lingering bodily fluids containing Ebola virus from survivors could spark future epidemics. There are thousands of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] survivors in West Africa.Guinea's Ebola epidemic was declared over in December [2015] but the disease was then found in 2 bodies months later.More than 11 000 people have been killed by Ebola since 2013, the vast majority in West Africa, and there have been numerous flare-ups of EVD.[The persistence of EVD in the semen is a serious problem contributing to difficulty to control virus spread. It is interesting that the presence of a very different virus, Zika virus, in the semen also presents a public health threat. - Mod.LK]Diagnostic assay---------------1 Jun 2016: New Idylla Ebola virus triage test granted emergency use authorization by U.S. FDA<http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-idylla-ebola-virus-triage-test-granted-emergency-use-authorization-by-us-fda-300277380.html>[The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of a Johnson & Johnson (J&J) diagnostic test that can detect Ebola virus during a suspected outbreak. The Idylla-TM EBOV Test detects the Ebola strain which caused greater than 11 000 deaths in the West Africa 2014 outbreak. The test uses only a few drops of blood and can distinguish Ebola from other fevers, such as malaria, in 100 minutes.The test is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test intended for the qualitative detection of RNA from the Ebola Zaire virus (detected in the 2014 West Africa outbreak) in EDTA venous whole blood from individuals with signs and symptoms of Ebola virus infection in conjunction with epidemiological risk factors. The blood sample is placed into a sealed cartridge and requires no further manipulation of potentially infected blood. After processing, the outside of the cartridge can be decontaminated prior to disposal. Results are delivered within 100 minutes. The Idylla Ebola virus triage test does not require cold-chain reagent storage. It is highly standardized, automated, and requires minimal training to interpret the results.] [Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.
