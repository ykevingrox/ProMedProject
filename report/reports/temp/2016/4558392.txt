CTV News Windsor [edited]<http://windsor.ctvnews.ca/two-more-mosquitoes-known-to-transmit-zika-virus-found-in-windsor-trap-1.3110605>The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit says 2 additional _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes have been found in a Windsor trap. That brings the total trapped in Windsor-Essex to 6. The _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is known to transmit the Zika virus [as well as chikungunya and dengue viruses. - Mod.TY].When analyzed in the laboratory, the health unit says the 2 new additional _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes also tested negative for Zika. All of the mosquitoes have been found in a single local mosquito trap in Windsor over a 4 week time period during routine monitoring and surveillance for West Nile virus.""The finding of these mosquitoes 3 times in last 4 weeks may mean that the species has established a breeding ground around the trap,"" says Dr Gary Kirk, medical officer of health. ""We continue to believe there is no current increased risk to the Windsor-Essex County population for the transmission of Zika virus and, accordingly, would recommend no additional Zika virus testing for Windsor-Essex County residents beyond the current guidelines,"" he added.The _Aedes albopictus_ feeds on humans but they also feed on animals, which makes it less likely for them to spread the virus. For Zika virus transmission to occur, the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito would need to feed on an infected person and then feed upon another susceptible person.The greatest risk to contracting Zika virus continues to be centered on those who have traveled to Zika-risk areas (such as South America, the Caribbean and Florida) or who are or have been in sexual contact with these travelers.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is very likely that there is a small, circumscribed breeding population of _Ae. albopictus_ in the Windsor, Ontario area, as the medical officer of health suggests. This is not especially surprising, since this mosquito occurs across the Upper Midwest and New England states of the USA, very close to the Canadian border (see the CDC distribution map at <http://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/range.html>). These mosquitoes' eggs are capable to going into diapause to survive the winter. It will be interesting to see if they survive over-winter in Windsor and appear again in the spring and summer of the coming year (2017). The risk of mosquito transmission of Zika, chikungunya or dengue viruses by this mosquito in Windsor at this time is essentially zero. A different invasive mosquito, _Aedes japonicas_ was found in British Colombia, Canada last year (2015), far away from Ontario across Canada. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1458>.]
