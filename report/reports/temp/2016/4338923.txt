Medscape [edited]<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/865957>US health officials are continuing to investigate a multistate outbreak of infections caused by _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex possibly linked to contaminated oral liquid docusate stool softener products.In its [8 Jul 2016] update, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised against treating any patient with oral liquid docusate products [see item 2 below].According to the CDC, as of [8 Jul 2016], 47 _B. cepacia_ complex cases have been confirmed by molecular typing to match 1 of 2 outbreak strain types identified from healthcare facilities in 5 states. The CDC is also looking into reports of possible cases from additional states.The CDC has confirmed that 2 samples of unused oral liquid docusate product received from one of the affected hospitals have tested positive for _B. cepacia_ complex. Further testing is underway to determine whether bacteria from these samples match the outbreak strains.In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration is conducting tests on multiple liquid docusate products that are epidemiologically linked to reported _B. cepacia_ complex cases. To date, the CDC has confirmed one product as having _B. cepacia_ complex growth.In a preliminary update on [24 Jun 2016], the CDC noted that these infections have occurred primarily in ventilated patients without cystic fibrosis (CF) who are being treated in intensive care units. At that time, and again in its [29 Jun 2016] update, the CDC recommended that facilities not use any oral liquid docusate products for patients who are critically ill, ventilated, or immunosuppressed.In its [8 Jul 2016] update, the CDC expanded this recommendation to all patient populations. ""If an oral liquid docusate stool softener is medically necessary, alternative medicines should be used,"" the CDC says.The agency urges healthcare providers and laboratories to remain alert for infections caused by _B. cepacia_ complex occurring among non-CF patients and to inform infection prevention staff immediately when these infections are identified. In addition, although infections caused by _B. cepacia_ complex are known to occur among patients with CF, any clusters of such infections should be reported. ""Cases and clusters should be reported to state or local public health authorities,"" the CDC advises.Facilities that identify infections caused by _B. cepacia_ complex among non-CF patients or clusters of these infections among CF patients are asked to sequester and save all docusate products used in the facility.Û Û The CDC said it will update the situation by [14 Jul 2016]. More information on the outbreak can be found on the CDC website at <https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/b-cepacia/index.html>.[Byline: Megan Brooks]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 8 Jul 2016Source: CDC, Healthcare-associated Infections (HAIs) [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/b-cepacia/index.html>Recommendations---------------CDC continues to work with FDA, health departments, and multiple healthcare facilities to investigate a multi-state outbreak of infections caused by _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex (also known as ""_B. cepacia_ complex""). At this time, CDC continues to recommend that clinicians not use any liquid docusate product as a stool softener or for any other medical purpose. This recommendation is now expanded to all patient populations. If an oral liquid docusate stool softener is medically necessary, alternative medicines should be used.CDC urges healthcare providers and laboratories to remain on alert for infections caused by _B. cepacia_ complex occurring among non-cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and should inform infection prevention staff immediately when these infections are identified. In addition, although infections caused by _B. cepacia_ complex are known to occur among patients with CF, any clusters of such infections should be reported. Cases and clusters should be reported to state or local public health authorities.Facilities that identify infections caused by _B. cepacia_ complex among non-CF patients or clusters of these infections among CF patients should sequester and save all docusate products used in the facility.Û Û Investigation update--------------------To date, 47 _B. cepacia_ complex cases have been confirmed by molecular typing to match 1 of 2 outbreak strain types identified from healthcare facilities in 5 states. Reports of possible cases from additional states are currently being investigated. CDC has confirmed that 2 samples of unused oral liquid docusate product received from one of the affected hospitals have tested positive for _B. cepacia_ complex. Further testing is being conducted to determine if bacteria from these samples match the outbreak strains. FDA is currently testing multiple liquid docusate products that are epidemiologically linked to reported _B. cepacia_ complex cases.To date, CDC has confirmed one product as having _B. cepacia_ complex growth; however, because of epidemiologic links, CDC is concerned about potential contamination of multiple liquid docusate products, pending FDA's ongoing investigation of shared ingredients in the products in question.CDC will provide an update to this announcement by [14 Jul 2016].

The outbreak is associated with use of oral liquid docusate suspected of being contaminated with _B. cepacia_. As of 29 Jun 2016, the FDA had not issued a recall of specific docusate sodium products (<http://www.enclarapharmacia.com/2016/06/29/docusate-sodium-liquid-formulations-alert/>). Docusate is a stool softener, used to treat or prevent constipation._B. cepacia_ complex is a group of related lactose-non fermenting, Gram-negative bacterial species, some of which are capable of causing life-threatening respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised patients or patients with chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217180>). _B. cepacia_ is a water/soil organism that was formerly classified as _Pseudomonas cepacia_. _B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments and can contaminate certain antiseptic solutions such as quaternary ammonium salts, chlorhexidine, and iodine products. _B. cepacia_ bacteria are often resistant to common antibiotics.In 2005, CDC was notified by several states of clusters of pneumonia and other infections caused by _B. cepacia_ and associated with contaminated mouthwash (<https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/organisms/bCepacia.html>). In 2004, CDC was notified of a voluntary recall of over-the-counter nasal spray due to contamination with _B. cepacia_ complex, and also in 2004, _B. cepacia_ was linked to nosocomial infections among intensive care unit patients and associated with exposure to sublingual probes (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5334a7.htm>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
