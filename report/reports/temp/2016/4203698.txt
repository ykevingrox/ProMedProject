Information about the outbreak were released on the website of the Swedish Public Health Agency (2), and also on different media outlets (3,4). A Swedish media source (3) reported the outbreak to have affected 11 Swedish counties, and the implicated salami sticks are sold in Swedish and Danish stores (at this point, no similar outbreaks have been reported in Finland, which extends along the eastern border of Sweden, and in which Tulip sells some of its processed meat products). The same media source reported a recall of 2.5 tons of the implicated salami from Swedish stores, however, the company spokesperson emphasized that _Salmonella_ positive samples were isolated from open containers and not from closed ones. The outbreak in Sweden is believed to have happened between 10 Mar 2016 and 10 Apr 2016 (3). To date, no similar outbreaks have been reported during the same period in Denmark. It is worth noting that a few years back, similar outbreaks occurred in Denmark, also due to consumption of salami (5, 6).References----------1.
