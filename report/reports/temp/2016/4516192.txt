Dhaka Tribune [edited]<http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2016/09/25/12-infected-anthrax-rajshahi/>Those who prepared and ate the meat of a sick buffalo which had been purchased from India by one RafiqulI of Markanda village got infected, Godagari Livestock officer Dr Saiful Islam said on Sun [25 Sep 2016]. He said the buffalo was slaughtered on 10 Sep [2016].Of the infected people, 10 were identified as MR, 45, IH, 50, RA, 50, RabiulI, 35, RafiqulI, 35, S, 30, M, 25 of Markanda village; UK, 40, of Bhushona village; and HA, 40 and T, 40, of Bautia village. The infected people said they had taken medicine from village doctors after the symptoms of the disease started appearing on their bodies.Later, they were admitted to Godagari Upazila Health Complex, Rajshahi Medical College and Hospital, [and] other private clinics. They are still undergoing treatment. Godagari Upazila Health and Livestock officers visited the village [sic, unclear but probably just Markanda village, if the clinical cases cluster of villages reflected the purchasers of this contaminated buffalo meat. - Mod.MHJ] and advised the people to avoid meat for the next few days.Anthrax infection breaks out in the district every year after the flood water recedes.[Byline: Abdullah Al Dulal]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The moral of this tale is that when you go to the expense of buying a buffalo from India, and it is the anthrax season in your region, do quarantine and vaccinate said buffalo on its arrival. An expensive error only made worse when your helping neighbours and relatives come down with the disease.Since the ""disease"" symptoms ""started appearing on their bodies"": I think we can assume that they all suffered from cutaneous anthrax; mortality is more likely with gastroenteric anthrax. Any prior antibiotic treatment by the village doctors would have precluded laboratory confirmation once they reached the various medical facilities. At most one needs only a couple to help butcher a buffalo so we can assume that 7 got ill from handling the contaminated meat.Maps of Bangladesh can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/bw2fuve> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13276>.
