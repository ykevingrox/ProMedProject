The KDHE and personnel from the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] assessed the Louisburg Cider Mill on 27 Oct 2016. State inspectors collected samples for testing. Hebert said the Kansas Department of Agriculture notified him via email that all of the samples came back negative for _E. coli_.The cider mill uses apples from growers in and around the Kansas City metropolitan area, Hebert said. The company uses a heat pasteurization process for all of its cider products but does not add preservatives. During the annual Ciderfest, which was on the weekends of 24-25 Sep 2016 and 1-2 Oct 2016 food and craft vendors have booths on the cider mill grounds. In 2016, Hebert said, there were 12 to 15 food vendors with everything from ice cream to barbecue. He was asked to provide a list of them to the state investigators.The festival weekends also included pancake breakfasts by a local Lions Club this year. In addition to those multiple food sources as possible vectors for the _E. coli_, a pony ride operation was on the mill grounds for the festival. A few goats, pigs and other farm animals are kept near the corn maze during the festival, but Hebert said it is not set up as a petting zoo.State officials initially concentrated on activities during the 1st of the 2 festival weekends, Hebert said. But the notice posted Wednesday, 2 Nov 2016, by the state health department references both weekends.[Byline: Coral Beach]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As the cider itself was pasteurized, it is much less likely to be the vehicle for the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. As noted in the post, there were a number of food vendors there as potential sources as well as some livestock. ProMED would appreciate any information regarding the vehicle in this outbreak. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/219>.]
