CDC. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2016; 65(28): 718-9<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528a3.htm?s_cid=mm6528a3_w>Straily A, Feldpausch A, Ulbrich C, et al: Notes from the field: _Rickettsia parkeri_ Rickettsiosis -- Georgia, 2012-2014----------------------------------------------------------------------During 2012-2014, 5 cases of _Rickettsia parkeri_ rickettsiosis were identified by a single urgent care practice in Georgia, located approximately 40 miles [64.4 km] southwest of Atlanta. Symptom onset occurred during June-October, and all patients had a known tick bite. Patients ranged in age from 27 to 72 years (median = 53 years), and all were male. The most commonly reported initial signs were erythema (n=3) and swelling (n=2) at the site of the bite. 2 patients reported fever and a 3rd patient reported a rash and lymphadenopathy without fever. Other symptoms included myalgia (n=3), chills (n=3), fatigue (n=2), arthralgia (n=2), and headache (n=2). Eschar biopsy specimens were collected from each patient using a 4-mm or 5-mm punch and placed in 10 percent neutral buffered formalin or sterile saline. These specimens were tested by immunohistochemical (IHC) stains, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays, or cell culture isolation to determine if there was evidence of infection with a Rickettsia species (1).IHC evidence of spotted fever group rickettsiae was found in the eschar biopsy specimens in all 5 cases. In 4 cases, the biopsy specimens were also positive for _R. parkeri_ by qPCR. The 5th case (specimen positive only by IHC testing) was considered a probable _R. parkeri_ case based on clinical signs and symptoms. _R. parkeri_ was grown in cell culture from 1 specimen from which isolation was attempted. All patients were treated with oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for a minimum of 10 days, and all recovered._R. parkeri_, recently recognized as a pathogen of humans, is transmitted by _Amblyomma maculatum_ (Gulf Coast tick) (Figure [for figure, see source URL. - Mod.LL]). The disease in humans is most commonly characterized by a necrotic, ulcerated, or scabbed lesion at the tick bite site, known as an inoculation eschar (Figure), which is generally followed by the patient experiencing some combination of fever, headache, malaise, and a sparse maculopapular or vesiculopustular rash (1). The 1st confirmed human infection with _R. parkeri_ was described in 2004; through June 2016, a total of 39 cases, predominantly from the southeastern USA, have been documented in the scientific literature or confirmed by laboratory assays at CDC (2,3). The incidence of _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis in the USA is unknown. Serological assays currently used to diagnose spotted fever group rickettsial infections lack species-specificity, and there is considerable cross-reactivity among pathogens. It is likely that some, or possibly many, of the approximately 13 500 noncharacterized cases of spotted fever group rickettsioses reported in the USA during 2008-2012 were caused by _R. parkeri_ (4).The identification of 5 cases of _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis from one medical practice during a 3-year interval suggests that this disease is underrecognized in Georgia. During 2012-2014, a total of 335 cases of spotted fever group rickettsiosis were reported in Georgia, including 38 from the health district where the urgent care practice is located. 4 cases of _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis recently were diagnosed by a clinician in southern Mississippi (5), indicating that the disease might be more common throughout the range of _A. maculatum_ than currently realized.The recognized range of _A. maculatum_ has increased considerably during the past 70 years and now includes most states in the southeastern USA (1). Clinicians should suspect _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis in patients who have febrile illnesses after being bitten by a tick, particularly in patients with an eschar at the bite site. Eschar biopsy samples are the most versatile diagnostic specimen and can be tested by IHC stains, qPCR assays, or cell culture isolation techniques; alternatively, a sterile swab of the eschar can be tested using qPCR and is less invasive than a biopsy (6). These tests are not widely available but can be performed at CDC and some academic hospitals (3). Because different spotted fever rickettsioses vary greatly in severity, species-specific diagnoses provide more accurate determinations of hospitalization and case-fatality rates associated with each disease. Doxycycline is the recommended treatment for all patients with a tickborne rickettsial infection, including _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis (3). Infection with _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis and other tickborne rickettsial diseases can be minimized by avoiding contact with ticks and by promptly removing attached or crawling ticks after exposures to tick-infested habitats. Persons should use Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellent products and check themselves, their children, and their pets after spending time in tick-infested habitats (3).References----------1.

Tick-borne SFGR are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick, and may cause similar signs and symptoms to those observed for RMSF. These pathogens include several species of _Rickettsia_ found in the United States, including _R. parkeri_ and _Rickettsia_ species 364D (Table 1). In addition, numerous tick-borne SFGR pathogenic to humans have been described internationally, including but not limited to _R. conorii_ and _R. africae_ (Table 2). Travelers may be at risk for exposure to these pathogens when engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for tick exposure, and physicians should maintain awareness of these diseases when a patient presents with a febrile illness within 2 weeks of returning home. Rickettsial infections with _R. africae_ have been reported as a common cause of fever in travelers returning from South Africa.""""The initial symptoms of tick-borne SFGR infections generally include fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. A maculopapular or petechial rash may be present, and frequently a distinctive eschar (blackened or crusted skin) may develop at the site of a tick bite. Multiple eschars may be present if more than one tick bite occurred. The observance of an eschar at the site of tick bite may provide the clinician with a diagnostic clue that can help differentiate the infection from RMSF, although eschars may also be rarely reported with R. rickettsii infection. The severity of illness may vary depending on the species. For example, human infections with _R. parkeri_ and _R. africae_ are generally considered mild and to some extent self-limiting infections. In contrast, _R. conorii_ and some other SFGR infections may be more severe. Prompt treatment with doxycycline is recommended if tick-borne SFGR is suspected, and should never be delayed pending the outcome of diagnostic tests.""""Different SFGR pathogens cause immune reactions in humans that can be difficult to distinguish with antibody-based laboratory techniques. Because these agents exhibit serologic cross-reactivity with available tests for _R. rickettsii_, some human illnesses currently being attributed to RMSF in the United States may actually be caused by other SFGR, such as _R. parkeri_, _Rickettsia_ 364D, or imported spotted fevers.""Although the severity of infections attributable to SFGR vary greatly depending on the causative species, all suspect patients should be treated as if they have _R. rickettsii_ infection. Physicians seeking confirmation of infection with a SFGR pathogen may elect to use commercially available serologic assays that diagnose RMSF, and should report it as a case of ""spotted fever rickettsiosis"" to their state health department. Additional methods that may be used to help identify the causative agent include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and culture isolation of a swab or biopsy from an eschar or rash site. Specimens should be submitted to the state health department in the state where the patient resides, who can submit the samples to CDC for testing.
