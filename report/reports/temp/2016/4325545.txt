The International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS in eastern Africa has petitioned the health ministry to intervene.The activists raised a red-flag ahead of the HIV/AIDS international conference in Durban South Africa next month [August 2016], where they are required to be vaccinated before they travel.The permanent secretary in the health ministry, Dr Asuman Lukwago, confirmed that the vaccine causes reactions in HIV/AIDS patients, but only in those with severely compromised immunity.Currently, the government is undertaking a yellow fever vaccination programme in the country. Dr Lukwago says all Ugandans are required to take the vaccine, including HIV/AIDS patients. He is advising patients to report all symptoms emerging from the ongoing yellow fever vaccination exercise so that health experts can offer treatment.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above does not indicate what yellow fever (YF) vaccination reactions are claimed to have occurred in HIV-positive individuals or how many have occurred. A knowledgeable source indicated to ProMED that Dr. Lukwago's statement above is correct; YF vaccination causes reactions only in those who are severely immunocompromised, and there has been only one death of an HIV-positive individual due to YF vaccination. Unfortunately, these types of unsubstantiated statements crop up and circulate, taking on a life of their own, and may discourage people from receiving YF vaccine.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Uganda can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18593>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Adverse vaccine effectsDate: Mon 4 Jul 2016Source: Journal of Travel Medicine [edited] <http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taw045 taw045>Nicole P. Lindsey, Ingrid B. Rabe, Elaine R. Miller, Marc Fischer, J. Erin Staples. Adverse event reports following yellow fever vaccination, 2007-13.Background: Yellow fever (YF) vaccines have been available since the 1930s and are generally considered safe and effective. However, rare reports of serious adverse events (SAE) following vaccination have prompted the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices to periodically expand the list of conditions considered contraindications and precautions to vaccination.Methods: We describe adverse events following YF vaccination reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from 2007 through 2013 and calculate age- and sex-specific reporting rates of all SAE, anaphylaxis, YF vaccine-associated neurologic disease (YEL-AND) and YF vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD).Results: There were 938 adverse events following YF vaccination reported to VAERS from 2007 through 2013. Of these, 84 (9 percent) were classified as SAEs for a rate of 3.8 per 100 000 doses distributed. Reporting rates of SAEs increased with increasing age, with a rate of 6.5 per 100 000 in persons aged 60-69 years and 10.3 in persons 70 years or older. The reporting rate for anaphylaxis was 1.3 per 100 000 doses distributed and was highest in persons 18 years or older (2.7 per 100 000). Reporting rates of YEL-AND and YEL-AVD were 0.8 and 0.3 per 100 000 doses distributed, respectively; both rates increased with increasing age.Conclusions: These findings reinforce the generally acceptable safety profile of YF vaccine but highlight the importance of continued physician and traveller education regarding the risks and benefits of YF vaccination, particularly for older travellers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The key word in this report is ""rare."" The acceptability of this rare risk for travelers is one thing, but vaccination in the face of an outbreak is another, where the risk of infection is high and the disease can lead to death.Reference:Guidelines for administering vaccine to prospective travelers has been published.
