Several cases have already been reported in Israel.According to ECDC, West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. Humans and horses are incidental dead-end hosts. Most human infections are asymptomatic and the majority of clinical cases of West Nile infections are mild and present with flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache and body aches.In more severe cases, most often observed among the elderly, there may be signs of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis or meningitis.In Europe, West Nile virus outbreaks are erratic and spatially and temporally-limited phenomena, occurring quite unpredictably. There is no specific treatment for viral infection and a vaccine is not available.The ECDC, headquartered in the Swedish capital since 2005, works with health authorities across Europe to fight infectious diseases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[WNV fever cases are beginning to be detected from many countries in Europe. An increasing number of cases in humans and equine animals have been reported from Europe in recent years. WNV has been present in Europe since the 1950s and is transmitted by mosquitoes.ECDC started West Nile fever surveillance in 2011 during the mosquito transmission season, in order to inform the blood safety authorities in Europe of areas in the EU and the neighborhood with West Nile cases; according to EU legislation, blood donors from such areas should be deferred or tested [Comment borrowed from Mod.TY]. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010>.]
