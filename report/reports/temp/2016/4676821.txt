The Buffalo News [edited]<http://buffalonews.com/2016/12/04/niagara-health-chief-attributes-mounting-legionnaires-total-to-more-testing/>Niagara County's [New York state] total number of confirmed legionnaires' disease cases this year [2016] is up to 37, but the county public health director said [Fri 2 Dec 2016] that could be attributable to more testing for the disease.Daniel J Stapleton said 25 of the 37 cases are in the City or Town of Lockport, with the number of confirmed fatalities at 2. Niagara County had only 12 legionnaires' cases in 2015 and the same number in 2014, so 37 is more than 3 times as many. ""I'm not saying it's not an unusually large number, but the cause of it, I believe and the state believes, is because of confirmatory testing,"" Stapleton said.The State Health Department made an effort to raise awareness of legionnaires' disease in New York after a large outbreak in the Bronx in August 2015, in which 120 people became ill and 12 died. The outbreak was blamed on a cooling system tower at a Bronx hotel, which was contaminated with _Legionella_, the bacteria that cause the pneumonia-like respiratory disease. After that, the state ordered testing of all cooling towers for _Legionella_ every 90 days, and urged doctors to order more tests for legionnaires' disease.In Niagara County, the source of the cases in the Lockport cluster has not been proven. ""The numbers are going up because doctors have been made aware of the issue and are doing the confirmatory testing, which they might not have done before,"" Stapleton said. ""They might have just treated the patient with antibiotics, it (the ailment) resolved on its own and it wasn't reported.""However, a similar increase in legionnaires' cases has not been seen statewide. The State Health Department said as of [Fri 2 Dec 2016] there had been 425 confirmed cases in the entire state outside New York City. There were 433 cases in all of 2015.Paul R Dicky, county environmental health director, told the county Board of Health on [Thu 1 Dec 2016] that his staff has checked out 101 cooling towers in the county. Stapleton said only 2 have had elevated levels of _Legionella_. One was the cooling tower at Eastern Niagara Hospital in Lockport, which failed a _Legionella_ test in September [2016] after passing one in June.A man who lived on a street bordering the hospital property, [a 68-year-old man], of Beverly Avenue, died [22 Jul 2016] of legionnaires' disease. His family revealed the information to The Buffalo News; authorities have never confirmed it officially, but the family showed The News his death certificate, listing legionnaires' disease as the cause of death._Legionella_ is regarded as a common bacterium in the environment, living in moist areas. The disease can be contracted only by breathing it in [also aspiration in some circumstances], but most people who encounter it don't get sick, the State Health Department says. Patients tend to have compromised immune or respiratory systems. [The 68-year-old man who died], for example, had undergone 2 rounds of chemotherapy for bladder cancer when he contracted legionnaires' disease.The only other cooling tower in the county found to have elevated _Legionella_ levels was at an industrial plant on Buffalo Avenue in Niagara Falls last spring [2016]. Stapleton, who did not identify the factory, said there were no reported legionnaires' cases in that part of Niagara Falls, which is lightly populated.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said _Legionella_ can travel about a quarter-mile [0.4 km] when expelled from a cooling tower. However, there are dozens of strains [species] and substrains of _Legionella_, and not all of them make people sick. Symptoms generally appear 5 or 6 days after a vulnerable person breathes in the bacteria.Stapleton said the State Health Department lab has not been able to grow a _Legionella_ culture from DNA [?] in sputum samples taken from patients with legionnaires' disease this year [2016], but the antibiotics used to treat the disease may have killed the bacteria before the samples were taken. That has interfered with efforts to pinpoint the cause of the Lockport cluster of legionnaires' patients.Summer and early fall are prime time for the disease. Stapleton said that could be because cooling towers are more heavily used then.--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[In a previous ProMED-mail post, a cluster of 8 patients with legionnaires' disease who live or work near Eastern Niagara Hospital was reported in the city of Lockport, New York (Legionellosis - USA (21): (NY) RFI 20161016.4562851). One cooling tower for this hospital tested positive for _Legionella_, but we were not told the species of _Legionella_ isolated from this cooling tower or the species of _Legionella_ causing the infections in the 8 patients.We are now told that it was not possible to obtain cultures for _Legionella_ from sputum in patients with legionnaires' disease in Niagara County, which suggests that the diagnoses of legionnaires' disease in these patients were confirmed by urine antigen assay for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. If the Eastern Niagara Hospital cooling tower were also positive for this particular species, _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, this would suggest that at least some of the cases could be attributed to this cooling tower. Additionally, if no new cases have occurred after remediation of this cooling tower, it would also suggest that this tower was the source. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.We are told in the news report above that Niagara County, in which the city of Lockport is located, had 25 cases of legionnaires' disease so far this year (2016), and apparently most cases in Niagara County are associated with Lockport, whereas Niagara County had only 12 legionnaires' cases in 2014 and 2015; there was no similar increased incidence for New York State as a whole, which suggests there are one or more sources of _Legionella_ that account for the increased incidence of legionellosis in Niagara County, not just increased reporting that could have resulted from a statewide campaign.Lockport, with a population was 21 165, is a city in Niagara County, in northwestern New York State, about 30 miles (48 km) north east of the city of Buffalo, NY (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockport_(city),_New_York>). The Erie Canal passes through the center of the city. Niagara Falls and North Tonawanda are other cities in Niagara County. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4328>.]
