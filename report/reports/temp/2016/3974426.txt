BBC [excerpted, edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35427493>WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said Zika had gone ""from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions"".She has set up a Zika ""emergency team"" after the ""explosive"" spread of the virus. It will meet on Monday [1 Feb 2016] to decide whether Zika should be treated as a global emergency.In a statement to the executive board meeting of the WHO, Dr Chan said: ""The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty.""Questions abound -- we need to get some answers quickly. For all these reasons, I have decided to convene an Emergency Committee. I am asking the Committee for advice on the appropriate level of international concern and for recommended measures that should be undertaken in affected countries and elsewhere.""Dr Carissa Etienne, the regional-director for the WHO Pan American Health Organization, said the link between the abnormalities and Zika had not been confirmed. But she added: ""We cannot tolerate the prospect of more babies being born with neurological and other malformations and more people facing the threat of paralysis.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is reasonable to expect that Zika virus will eventually spread to all countries in the Americas that have local transmission of dengue virus, since the vector is the same mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_), vector control efforts have not been very successful and the human populations are susceptible. - Mod.TY]******[2] Cases in various countries:AmericasMexico and Central America---Mexico. 22 Jan 2016.

A 57-year-old Viennese woman of Brazilian origin presented on 16 Dec 2015 with an itching generalised erythematous rash and arthralgia, in the absence of fever, at the outpatient clinic for infectious diseases of the Kaiser-Franz-Joseph Hospital in Vienna. The symptoms had started on 12 Dec [2015], one day after she had returned from a 4 week vacation visiting friends and relatives in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Laboratory analysis including complete blood count, liver and kidney function test and C-reactive protein, showed no abnormalities. On [18 Dec 2015] the patient experienced onset of swollen joints (wrist, knee and ankle) and sub-febrile temperatures, the rash had resolved in the meantime. The laboratory analysis still did not show any abnormalities. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was prescribed and the symptoms disappeared subsequently. On [11 Jan 2016] the patient, now feeling entirely healthy again, came for a follow up visit. Blood drawn on day 5 and 31 after onset of symptoms were tested for infection with Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus at the Department of Virology of the Medical University of Vienna.Zika virus infection was diagnosed by the presence of Zika Virus IgM antibodies (strong signal in ELISA) in the 2nd serum sample 31 days after onset of illness. Additional due to cross reactive antibodies we could demonstrate a large rise in titres in the dengue virus hemagglutination inhibition test from 1:160 (5th day after onset of illness) to 1:2560 in the follow up serum sample. Dengue virus IgM was negative in both serum samples with two different tests excluding a dengue virus infection. Serological tests for chikungunya were negative. Zika virus RNA could not be detected by PCR on day 5, as well as no dengue and chikungunya virus RNA and dengue NS1-antigen.This is the 1st case of ZIKV infection diagnosed in Austria, which should, in consideration of the association of ZIKV infection and microcephalus in foetuses as well as post-Zika Guillain-Barre syndrome, raise the awareness of this differential diagnosis in returning travellers.Submitted by: Dr. Hermann Laferl (<hermann.Laferl@gmail.com>), Dr. Stephan W.

Fauci, M.D., and David M. Morens, M.D.]Through early epidemiologic surveillance and human challenge studies, Zika was characterized as a mild or inapparent denguelike disease with fever, muscle aches, eye pain, prostration, and maculopapular rash. In more than 60 years of observation, Zika has not been noted to cause hemorrhagic fever or death. There is in vitro evidence that Zika virus mediates antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, a phenomenon observed in dengue hemorrhagic fever; however, the clinical significance of that finding is uncertain.The ongoing pandemic confirms that Zika is predominantly a mild or asymptomatic denguelike disease. However, data from French Polynesia documented a concomitant epidemic of 73 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurologic conditions in a population of approximately 270 000, which may represent complications of Zika. Of greater concern is the explosive Brazilian epidemic of microcephaly, manifested by an apparent 20-fold increase in incidence from 2014 to 2015, which some public health officials believe is caused by Zika virus infections in pregnant women. Although no other flavivirus is known to have teratogenic effects, the microcephaly epidemic has not yet been linked to any other cause, such as increased diagnosis or reporting, increased ultrasound examinations of pregnant women, or other infectious or environmental agents. Despite the lack of definitive proof of any causal relationship, some health authorities in afflicted regions are recommending that pregnant women take meticulous precautions to avoid mosquito bites and even to delay pregnancy. It is critically important to confirm or dispel a causal link between Zika infection of pregnant women and the occurrence of microcephaly by doing intensive investigative research, including careful case-control and other epidemiologic studies as well as attempts to duplicate this phenomenon in animal models.In a ""pure"" Zika epidemic, a diagnosis can be made reliably on clinical grounds. Unfortunately, the fact that dengue and chikungunya, which result in similar clinical pictures, have both been epidemic in the Americas confounds clinical diagnoses. Specific tests for dengue and chikungunya are not always available, and commercial tests for Zika have not yet been developed. Moreover, because Zika is closely related to dengue, serologic samples may cross-react in tests for either virus. Gene-detection tests such as the polymerase-chain-reaction assay can reliably distinguish the 3 viruses, but Zika-specific tests are not yet widely available.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Travel warningDate: Fri 22 Jan 2016Source: USA CDC [excerpted, edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6502e1.htm>Because there is neither a vaccine nor prophylactic medications available to prevent Zika virus infection, the USA CDC recommends that all pregnant women consider postponing travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. If a pregnant woman travels to an area with Zika virus transmission, she should be advised to strictly follow steps to avoid mosquito bites. Mosquitoes that spread Zika virus bite both indoors and outdoors, mostly during the daytime; therefore, it is important to ensure protection from mosquitoes throughout the entire day. Mosquito prevention strategies include wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents, using permethrin-treated clothing and gear, and staying and sleeping in screened-in or air-conditioned rooms. When used as directed on the product label, insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, and IR3535 are safe for pregnant women. Further guidelines for using insect repellents are available online (<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites>).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The Zika virus situation is rapidly changing in the Americas. New information is appearing every day. Although the association of Zika virus infection of pregnant women to microcephaly of their fetuses and newborns grows stronger, most public health specialists are still cautious about asserting a causal relationship. As Zika virus continues to spread, one hopes that reliable and economical diagnostic tests become available throughout the Americas and standard reporting systems become implemented. - Mod.TY]
