Davao Today [edited]<http://davaotoday.com/main/economy/health/cho-confirms-first-case-of-japanese-encephalitis-in-davao/>The City Health Office [CHO] has confirmed a case of Japanese encephalitis in Davao [city, Davao del Sur province] and warned the public of the viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes which can cause neurologic defects.Dr. Josephine Villafuerte of CHO here confirmed that a 52-year-old man from Bacaca was diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. He was discharged from the hospital last week.The patient now suffers from neurologic diseases, including memory lapses, as a result of the virus. Villafuerte said only a few fully recover from the disease.Villafuerte warned that aside from dengue, the public should also be cautious of the viral Japanese encephalitis carried by _Culex_ mosquitoes. She added that the mosquito that bit the patient could fly 30 to 50-meter radius and could bite another person again.Villafuerte said that the patient was exposed 5-15 days ago here in the city but was not reported immediately.""You should not be so complacent that there is just one case. We have to take into consideration that we have a lot of mosquito-borne illness, we have dengue, we have filaria, we have Japanese encephalitis, we have other illnesses also,"" she said.In a study by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Japanese encephalitis is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headaches, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizure, spastic paralysis and ultimately death. ""It could present manifestation of stroke because the patient will have neurologic deficit, but if we look on to his history and sample, you will know that it's not stroke but a virus called Japanese encephalitis,"" Villafuerte said.As for comparison, Villafuerte clarified that lower level of platelets like in dengue case is not the basis of knowing if a person suffers from Japanese encephalitis.The key facts presented by Villafuerte stated that there is no cure for the disease. ""The treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection,"" the WHO said.Research shows that there is an estimate of 68 000 clinical cases of JEV in many countries of Asia every year.Villafuerte said that observing the 4 o'clock habit is important to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. ""It's a viral, it's symptomatic, we really have to implement the 4 o'clock habit so the mosquito could not lay their eggs,"" she said. She said the surroundings should be kept dry and clean, including refrigerators, dishwashers, water dispensers and air conditioning units.Villafuerte said they are checking whether there are still other cases in other vicinity. ""So far, in 2 weeks no new case has been reported,"" she said.[Byline: Janika Mia Tiempo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the location of Davao city and Davao del Sur province can be accessed at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_City>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Viet NamDate: Wed 13 Jul 2016Source: Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-07/13/c_135510490.htm>Viet Nam's northern region is witnessing spread of Japanese encephalitis disease, the Department of Preventive Medicine under Viet Nam's Ministry of Health said on Wednesday [13 Jul 2016].Infected cases of the disease have been recorded in the capital of Hanoi, northern Bac Giang, Dien Bien, Son La, Thai Binh, Lao Cai provinces, northern Hai Phong city and central Thanh Hoa province, Nguyen Dac Phu, director of the Department was quoted by Vietnam News as saying.Since the beginning of 2016, Hanoi has recorded 2 deaths related to Japanese encephalitis [JE].Prolonged hot weather is creating favorable conditions for mosquito breeding and is leading to a high risk of spreading the disease, Phu said.Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease and can often be fatal if not diagnosed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A total case count to date is not provided in the above report. By the end of June 2016, Hanoi had reported 9 cases of JE (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160630.4319681).A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Viet Nam can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/152>. - Mod.TY]******[3] India (Kannur district, Kerala state)Date: Wed 13 Jul 2016Source: Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/Japanese-encephalitis-reported-in-Kannur/articleshow/53185630.cms>A case of Japanese encephalitis has been reported from Kalliassery in Kannur district [Kerala state]. This has put the health department officials on a high alert, and they have started measures to prevent the spread of the disease. According to district medical officer P K Baby, the patient is a 60-year-old man from Mottammal, and the place is under close monitoring to ensure it is not spread to others. Preventive measures such as fogging and spraying of bioinsecticides have been initiated in the locality to prevent the spread of the virus which is carried by mosquitoes, he said.The virus from the flaviviridae family affects the brain and it is found in pets like pork and cattle and also bats and water birds. From them, the virus is spread to human beings through _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes, a statement said. However, it is not spread among humans.Fever, headache, nausea or at times vomiting and severe body pain are the preliminary symptoms of the disease. If proper treatment is not given, the disease could turn fatal. Hence, if there are any such symptoms, patients should immediately get medical assistance, the statement said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.

A patient from Wazirganj in the district [Gaya, Bihar state], who was admitted at the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH) with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) symptoms, on Friday [15 Jul 2016] tested positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE) causing concern in the health department.The JE positive report was received from the Rajendra Memorial Virological Lab in Patna. Sources say that some samples of the patient earlier sent to a Pune lab for test were also tested positive for JE, but official confirmation has not been made yet. ANMMCH superintendent Dr S K Sinha said the civil surgeon has been informed about the development. ""Besides vaccination, health workers have also been directed to make people aware of the dos and don'ts of encephalitis and the treatment protocol, particularly early hospitalisation and shunning of quacks and faith healers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Bihar state has many JE cases every year.A map showing the location of the Gaya district can be accessed at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaya_district>.JE virus is endemic across eastern and southeast Asia, including Viet Nam, the Philippines and eastward to India. These reports do not indicate if there is widespread vaccination against JE, which is the most effective preventive measure. Vector control may provide short-term mosquito population reduction, but is not a long-term preventive measure. Extensive rice fields offer ample breeding sites. - Mod.TY]
