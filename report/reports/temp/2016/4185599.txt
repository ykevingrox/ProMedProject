G1, Globo.com [in Portuguese, trans. Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ, edited]<http://g1.globo.com/sp/campinas-regiao/noticia/2016/04/sobe-para-15-o-numero-de-casos-da-superbacteria-kpc-em-americana.html>The municipality of Americana in Sao Paulo state confirmed a new case of infection by [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria] in the Dr Waldemar Tebaldi Municipal Hospital, totaling 15 cases in the unit since January [2016], and 3 deaths associated with the bacillus. The city faces an outbreak of infection by these bacteria.The new victim is a man about 50 years old who had been hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and remains in isolation. The information was confirmed to G1 on [Thu 14 Apr 2016] by Arnaldo Gouvea, infectious disease physician at the hospital, who added that stool tests in all adult patients are being performed all week to check for new cases. The KPC is located in the digestive tract of the infected person.""Cases continue to be detected but at a lower frequency. If after 6 months they continue to be detected, it will be because of either sustained transmission within the unit or reintroduction by patients who arrive at the hospital,"" says the infectious disease specialist.Municipal authorities announced that elective surgeries and other services at the hospital have not been suspended and that it is searching for other possible cases of infection in private centers of the city.According to Gouvea, the 3 deaths associated with multidrug resistant bacteria KPC (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_) were men older than 50 years who had been admitted in the ICU for more than a month.Of the other 12 patients, 5 remain hospitalized, 3 in the ICU and 2 in isolation in the infirmary; the other 7 have been discharged.A team of nurses and nursing technicians has been assigned to take care of these patients exclusively, and any devices such as stethoscopes and blood pressure monitors used for these patients will not be used for any others.According Gouvea, the hospital does not have sufficient molecular biology technology to determine whether all cases of infection occurred because the bacterium is circulating in the unit or because it was introduced by an infected patient.He explained that weekly reports on the situation in the hospital have been sent to the State Health Secretariat but that the state epidemiological surveillance department hasn't sent a representative who would be able to do the analysis to verify the source of the contamination. ""I will send a report this week to notify them of this new case and will suggest that [state surveillance representatives] do this analysis for us. Through DNA testing, it is possible to determine whether there is only one lineage of bacteria involved. To date, the state has not said how it proposes to continue with the investigation,"" said Gouvea.For its part, the State Health Secretariat says that it follows the actions taken by the municipality and that to date, it has not received a request for support.The spread of KPC bacteria occurs by contact. In the case of infected bedridden patients, the chance of contamination is greater. ""Bedridden patients do not have control, so they defecate in bed or at bath time, contaminating the environment, bed, furniture, linens, etc. In the end, bacteria colonize the entire skin and ultimately the internal organs. While in the digestive tract, it does not cause disease; the problem is when it reaches other organs,"" said Gouvea.The greatest risk is for patients with serious health problems admitted to hospital. However, a person with a strong immune system may carry the bacterium without any manifestation of symptoms and eventually eliminate it naturally.The Americana Municipal Hospital reported an outbreak of the superbug KPC in February-March 2014, when 7 cases of infection were confirmed; 2 people died. At the time, elective surgeries were suspended.[Byline: Patricia Teixeira]--Communicated by:Dr Arnaldo Gouveia, Jr.Hospital Municipal de Americana<gouveinfecto@hotmail.com>[_Klebsiella_ species, particularly _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Klebsiella oxytoca_, are frequent nosocomial pathogens, causing pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septicemia, surgical wound sites, meningitis, and bacterial endophthalmitis. The presence of invasive devices such as IV catheters, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters, and use of antibiotics are factors that increase the likelihood of nosocomial infection with _Klebsiella_ species. The primary pathogenic reservoirs for transmission are the gastrointestinal tract of patients and the hands of hospital personnel. _Klebsiella_ can spread rapidly, often leading to clonal nosocomial outbreaks, which may be caused by multidrug-resistant _Klebsiella_ spp., especially extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) or _K. pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC)-producers.KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) are plasmid-encoded enzymes 1st found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name). KPCs are a type of beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.KPCs also hydrolyze all other beta-lactam antibiotics, and consequently KPC-producing organisms are resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics. KPC-producing organisms are also resistant to multiple other classes of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones due to linked resistance genes.KPCs have also been found in other organisms, including _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. KPCs are now commonly encountered in the USA, and have also been reported worldwide. Often breaks in infection control practices are found to have facilitated nosocomial outbreaks.The U.S. CDC has published guidelines for control of these organisms in healthcare facilities (Guidance for control of infections with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm>). All patients colonized or infected with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be placed on contact precautions. Early detection should be performed through use of targeted perirectal surveillance cultures to identify undetected carriers of carbapenemase-producing _Klebsiella_ spp. in nosocomial outbreak units. Strict infection control compliance (including reinforcement of hand hygiene and contact precautions), cohorting of all culture-positive patients, and periodic perirectal surveillance cultures of patients in the outbreak units should help control the spread of KPC-producing organisms.Genotyping clinical isolates would help to identify whether a single clone is circulating in the Brazilian hospital or multiple clones are being introduced. Also, matching genotypes of clinical isolates with possible environmental isolates would help confirm a source in the environment.Americana is a town with a population is 229 322 located in the center-east region of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo, 124 km (77 miles) northwest of the city of Sao Paulo (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana,_SÌ£o_Paulo#Location>). Americana was settled by refugees from the Confederate States of America after the American Civil War in 1866, a time when slavery was still legal in Brazil (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana,_SÌ£o_Paulo>). Slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888 (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei_Ì urea>).
