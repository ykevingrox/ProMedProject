Total number of deaths reported as of [29 Mar 2016] is 198.Of the 490 laboratory confirmed cases, 347 (nearly 71 percent) are reported from Luanda province. Huambo province has reported 66 confirmed cases, or 13.4 percent of the total.31 districts registered cases with onset of symptoms during the month of March 2016. No new district or province has reported a confirmed case within the last 48 hours.The overall vaccination campaign in Luanda province is 88 percent of the targeted population (5 804 475 of 6 583 216) while the total national stock of Yellow fever vaccines as of 29 Mar 2016 is 1 032 970 doses at central store.The last 3 districts in Luanda province (Rangel, Icolo e Bengo, and Kissama) have commenced vaccination activities. Microplans are being developed in the provinces of Huambo, Benguela, Huila, Cuanza Sul, and Uige for the next phase of vaccination.Public service messages on yellow fever and the importance of vaccination continue to be shown on national television. In addition, social mobilization was intensified during the well-attended football match between Angola and DR Congo on [30 Mar 2016] in Luanda to disseminate yellow fever messages focusing on preventive measures.Despite reports of at least 2 imported yellow fever cases from Angola, Kenyan Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said there is no yellow fever outbreak in the country. Dr Mailu clarified that the 2 cases reported in Kenya last month [March 2016] had posed no threat since as the victims contracted the disease well past the infective 5-day period and could therefore not pass on the disease.The outbreak in Angola has prompted other southern African nations to respond. In Rwanda, Minister for Health, Dr Agnes Binagwaho said the country is taking concrete steps in order to keep the country safe.""Everybody who is entering Rwanda has to have a yellow fever vaccination card in order to ensure protection of citizens. We also advise Rwandans who are travelling outside the country to be vaccinated for their own protection and that of the country,"" Binagwaho said.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not clear if there is enough yellow fever (YF) vaccine in Angola to cover all the individuals where transmission is occurring currently. It is urgent that the country-wide vaccination campaign be completed as soon as possible. As long as it continues, the risk remains that infected and viremic individuals could travel to other countries, bringing with them the risk of ongoing transmission there. As noted above, the YF outbreak in Angola has sounded the alarm in other countries in Africa and in China.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY]
