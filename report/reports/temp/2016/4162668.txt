Indy Star [edited]<http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/04/08/mumps-outbreak-reaches-65-mostly-colleges/82796644/>Mumps, 1st reported in February [2016] on many local college campuses, has continued to spread with a total of 65 people in Central Indiana who have now been diagnosed with the highly contagious respiratory disease, state health officials say.While the majority of cases have occurred on college campuses, 15 community cases, unconnected to those at colleges, also have been reported, the Indiana State Department of Health said Friday [8 Apr 2016] in a news release. There have been 24 confirmed cases at Butler University, 18 at Indiana University and 4 each at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and Purdue University.Mumps activity at the IU [Indiana University] campuses and Butler appears to be slowing, but the Purdue cases arose this week. College campuses, where many people live in close quarters with one another, are particularly rich environments in which the disease can spread rapidly.State health officials urge college students to make sure they have been vaccinated against the disease, which can lead to puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Other symptoms include fever, headache and muscle aches. Some people with mumps have mild symptoms and may not even know they have the disease. Mumps is spread up to 2 days before and 5 days after symptoms begin.[Byline: Shari Rudavsky]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Indiana may be accessed at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/USA/Indiana_map.jpg>.

A letter was sent to prospective students from the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid recommending that those who have not been vaccinated, not visit the campus due to their increased risk of contracting the virus. Likewise, those who may have been exposed to mumps or know they are infected with it, not visit campus for the health and safety of others. Harvard University Health Services has been working closely with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Cambridge Public Health Department to track and monitor the situation. Procedures are in place to protect current students and visitors.[In 2006, the United States experienced a multi-state mumps outbreak involving more than 6500 reported cases. This resurgence predominantly affected college-aged students living in the Midwest, with outbreaks occurring on many different Midwestern college campuses.In 2009 to 2010, 2 large outbreaks occurred. One multi-year outbreak involved about 3000 people and mostly affected high school-aged students who were part of a close-knit religious community in New York City and attended schools in which they had very close contact. The outbreak started when an infected student in this religious community returned from the United Kingdom where a large mumps outbreak was occurring.The 2nd outbreak involved about 500 people, mostly school-aged children, in the U.S. Territory of Guam.In 2011-2013, there were several smaller mumps outbreaks reported on college campuses in California, Virginia, and Maryland. However, these all had limited spread, and national case counts for these years were at usual levels (several hundred cases per year).Excerpted from <http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html>.Mumps activity seems to be high this year (2016), but the case numbers to date are lower than 2014 and 2015, i.e., 1223 and 1057, respectively. While it is only April, spring semester in colleges will be ending soon.
