Robert Koch Institute press release [in German, machine trans., edited]<http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/L/Lassa/Lassavirus-Infektion.html>Three contacts of the Lassa fever patient who died at the end of February 2016 at the Cologne University Hospital [North Rhine-Westphalia state] have been diagnosed with the disease. All are under observation.The deceased man worked for a humanitarian organization in Togo and was infected there. The patients now suffering from Lassa fever, to be regarded as secondary cases, had contact with the body of the deceased in the period from late February to early March 2016. They are currently in isolation wards in Dusseldorf [North Rhine-Westphalia state] and Frankfurt [Hesse state]. In all 3 cases, and due to their incipient symptoms, blood tests were carried out on 15 Mar 2016 and the diagnosis of Lassa virus infection was confirmed on 17 Mar 2016. In isolation, these patients can receive optimal care and treatment, without risk for the medical staff. The contacts of the 3 patients are being closely monitored.Although in Africa, and in particular in the medical and nursing context, human-to-human transmission of Lassa fever is possible, the transmission which has now occurred in Germany is unusual, and the circumstances under which it happened are being investigated. In previous cases, no secondary cases were reported among the many contacts of Lassa fever patients treated outside Africa, even though some were diagnosed as Lassa fever cases later and appropriate protective measures were therefore not always adhered to. However, an asymptomatic probable secondary infection was documented retrospectively in Germany.For other contacts of the deceased patient from Togo, the maximum incubation period of Lassa fever (21 days), which started after their last contact with the patient, will end in the next few days. They are under observation and will be placed in isolation immediately upon the occurrence of disease symptoms. None of the contact persons poses a risk of infection for the population. Transmission to close contacts usually only occurs while the patient has symptoms.Additional information for physicians, including routes of infection, symptoms, and diagnosis of Lassa fever, is available at <http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Merkblaetter/Ratgeber_Lassa-Fieber.html> [in German].Unlike the patient who was flown from Togo and was already seriously ill when he arrived in Cologne, the new patients became ill in Germany and have received optimal medical treatment from the beginning. Mortality from Lassa fever is significantly lower than that for Ebola virus disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is now the 1st documented outbreak of transmission of Lassa fever virus outside of Africa. Previously there had been a retrospectively identified seroconversion, also in Germany in 2000 (see Lassa fever - West Africa (14): Germany (RP) local transmission, mortician 20160316.4098169 for details).In a media report submitted by Dr. Gerhard Mosbach there is mention of an additional suspected case still pending laboratory results: <http://www.sueddeutsche.de/gesundheit/infektionskrankheit-weitere-lassa-faelle-in-deutschland-1.2914789> [in German]. Hence, if confirmed, the total number of secondary infections in Germany will be 4.We do not have information on the degree of contact these 2 newly reported infected individuals had. The 1st case (reported on 16 Mar 2016) is a mortician who had contact with the body of the fatal case (the fatal case was a nurse in Togo who came to Germany for treatment). Any additional information on the types of contact associated with transmission in Germany would be greatly appreciated.
