Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/fiji-leptospirosis-surge-prompts-health-warning-27049/>The Fiji Ministry of Health recently reported 61 cases of the severe bacterial infection, leptospirosis, since the beginning of the year [2016], according to a local media report. The cases are reported 2 months after Tropical Cyclone Winston hit the island and 2 weeks after Tropical Cyclone Zena passed south east of Fiji, causing torrential rains that triggered major flooding.Leptospirosis is caused by a corkscrew-shaped bacterium called _Leptospira interrogans_, and is often referred to as ""rat fever"" due to the principal role rats play in spreading the disease (scientists refer to this type of animal as a reservoir host). Other animals can also be important reservoirs of the disease. These animals can spread the disease in their urine, contaminating water, soil, or food. People who live in close contact with domestic animals or wildlife are at higher risk for getting the disease.People become infected by coming into contact with contaminated urine, water, food, or soil through breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose. Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to contaminated water, such as floodwaters. Person-to-person transmission is rare. Infected individuals initially experience fever, severe headache and muscle aches, abdominal pain, and occasionally a skin rash. Patients in the later stages of disease can suffer from jaundice, kidney failure, bleeding from the mouth or nose, bloody urine; and [the disease] can be fatal, especially without proper treatment.[byline: Robert Herriman]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is mostly extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post (Leptospirosis, hepatitis A - Fiji: (BA) contaminated water 20131117.2059440):Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic, but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life. Leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic leptospira.Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The leptospira Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/>). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 miles) north east of New Zealand's North Island (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji>). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png>. Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (<http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/167>.]
