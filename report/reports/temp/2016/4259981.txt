The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur has licensed its [dengue Vaccine] to Mexico and the Philippines. Last month [April 2016], Sanofi Pasteur rolled out its 1st ever dengue mass-vaccination programme. 4th graders are being vaccinated in 3 areas in the Philippines where dengue cases were highest last year [2015]. Mario Baquilod is in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the Philippine Department of Health. He said last year [2015] there were 200 415 reported cases of dengue in the Philippines, one of the largest numbers in recent years. Baquilod said the department wanted to add the vaccine to its arsenal of tools that combat the virus. The government aims to get one million children immunized against dengue by June [2016] -- so far 263 000 kids have received the vaccine. The vaccine, which works against all 4 variations of the disease, is close to 66 percent effective in preventing dengue and 93 percent effective against severe dengue. The vaccine is for individuals between the ages of 9 and 45. Trials found it was not effective on children younger than that.<http://www.irinnews.org/feature/2016/05/24/vaccine-rolled-out-philippines-offers-new-hope-against-dengue>[Maps of the Philippines can be seen at <http://www.charleskeng.com/images-map/philmap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]- Iloilo province. 25 May 2016. 212 cases in the 1st 4 months of 2016, with no deaths. Dengue cases in Iloilo City increased during the 1st quarter of this year [2016] compared to the previous year, the City Health Office reported. The early onset of the rainy season is favorable to the breeding of mosquitoes carrying the dengue virus. The city health reported that in January 2016 there were 79 dengue cases compared to 14 in 2015, 53 in February 2016 compared to 13 in February 2015, 51 in March 2016 compared to 31 in March 2015, and 29 in April 2016 compared to 31 in April 2015.

A case report published by Delhi's Fortis Escorts hospital in the 'Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology' suggests it can happen. According to the case report, the 29-year-old liver donor had developed high fever post-surgery last year [2015] and tests confirmed he had dengue. A few days later, the recipient developed similar symptoms and he too was tested positive for the dengue virus. Doctors conjecture the virus could have been transmitted only through the liver transplant. The doctors did not feel the need to recommend a change in the policy that currently does not require potential donors to be tested for dengue, attributing this stand to the lack of data on transmission of dengue virus from donor to recipient. They said only 3 reports of transplantation-related transmission of dengue have been mentioned in medical literature, one each for the transplantation of bone marrow, kidney and liver. The Escorts case was only the 2nd reported case of transmission of dengue infection from a donor to a recipient after a living-donor liver transplantation. The doctors said that the transplant recipient presented dengue symptoms similar to those in the disease transmitted by a mosquito bite.<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Donated-organs-can-be-dengue-carriers/articleshow/52425154.cms>[The reference for the paper cited above isGupta RK, Gupta G, Chorasiya VK, et al: Dengue Virus Transmission from Living Donor to Recipient in Liver Transplantation: A Case Report.

It is now mandatory for private practitioners and laboratories to report every case of dengue to the government [as part of efforts to] rein in cases of dengue and chikungunya, on the rise since January [2016]. Pune has recorded the highest number of dengue and chikungunya cases in the state over the past 4 months. A 78-year-old woman died of dengue a week ago. The Maharashtra state health department has directed PMC [Pune Municipal Corporation] to chalk out a micro-level action plan to check the spread of dengue.

A 79-year-old male died on [29 May 2016] at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the 5th dengue-related death this year [2016]. Authorities are urging vigilance to stop dengue transmission, as the warm-weather months draw near and Singapore enters its traditional dengue peak season. As the majority of mosquito breeding spots are found in homes, in places such as water containers, and flower pot plates and trays, members of the public should conduct the five-step Mozzie [mosquito] Wipeout, by removing stagnant water, inverting pails and plant pot plates, and changing water in vases regularly. Those with dengue should protect themselves from mosquito bites by applying repellent regularly, and those who show symptoms that suggest dengue should see their doctor early to be diagnosed, the authorities advised.

One dengue vaccine has been licensed, Dengvaxia (R) (CYD-TDV), developed by Sanofi Pasteur. Approximately 5 additional dengue vaccine candidates are in clinical development, with 2 candidates (developed by Butantan/Brazil and Takeda/Japan) expected to begin phase III trials in early 2016.""The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization reviewed CYD-TDV in April 2016 and recommended countries consider introduction of the vaccine only in geographic settings (national or subnational) with high endemicity. A WHO vaccine position paper will be published outlining WHO recommendations in July 2016.""Other existing intervention is vector control which has been the key strategy to control or prevent the transmission of dengue virus. Strategies include:- preventing mosquitoes from accessing egg-laying habitats by environmental management and modification;- disposing of solid waste properly and removing artificial man-made habitats;- covering, emptying and cleaning of domestic water storage containers on a weekly basis;- applying appropriate insecticides to water storage outdoor containers;- using of personal household protection such as window screens, long-sleeved clothes, insecticide treated materials, coils, and vaporizers;- improving community participation and mobilization for sustained vector control;- applying insecticides as space spraying during outbreaks as one of the emergency vector-control measures;- active monitoring and surveillance of vectors should be carried out to determine effectiveness of control interventions.(<http://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/dengue_q_and_a/en/>). - Mod.UBA][See Also:Dengue/DHF update (15): Asia, Pacific 20160519.4232403Dengue/DHF update (14): Asia 20160509.4209864Dengue/DHF update (13): Australia (QL) sylvatic, 2015 20160507.4207603Dengue/DHF update (12): Asia, Pacific 20160426.4185103Dengue/DHF update (11): Asia, Pacific 20160417.4164856Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia 20160410.4150514Dengue/DHF update (09): Asia, Pacific 20160403.4134321Dengue/DHF update (08): Americas, Pacific 20160326.4120839Dengue/DHF update (07): Americas, Asia 20160320.4106717Dengue/DHF update (06): Americas, Asia, Indian Ocean, Africa 20160303.4065700Dengue/DHF update (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160225.4049661Dengue/DHF update (04): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Middle East 20160217.4028506Dengue/DHF update (03): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160207.4001446Dengue/DHF update (02): Americas, Asia, Middle East, Africa, Pacific 201601Dengue/DHF update (01): Americas, Asia, Middle East, Africa 20160108.3921315 27.39709622015----Dengue/DHF update (35): Americas, Asia, Africa 20151124.38168182013----Dengue/DHF update (84): Americas 20131016.20056562008----Dengue/DHF update 2008 (17) 20080429.1477].................................................sb/uba/mj/mpp"
