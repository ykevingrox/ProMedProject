RFI [edited]<http://en.rfi.fr/france/20160904-paris-suspends-breast-milk-deliveries-after-two-babies-deaths>Supplies of breast milk for premature babies from Paris's central milk bank have been suspended following the deaths of 2 babies. Tests are under way to establish the origin of the bacteria that caused the deaths.Supplies of breast milk from Paris's Necker hospital, which houses the region's milk bank, were suspended ""as a precautionary measure"" on [Sat 3 Sep 2016], following the infection of 3 babies with the _Bacillus cereus_ bacterium, which is common but can be dangerous for some premature children. 2 of the babies have died, but the 3rd has recovered.""It is not possible to confirm that the milk was the source of the contaminations but it is not possible to rule out the possibility either,"" the Paris hospitals' managing body said.Tests so far have proved negative but were continuing on [Sat 3 Sep 2016] as the ban was declared.The milk bank supplies 700 litres per month to mothers of premature babies weighing less that 1.5 kilos [3.3 lb], who have no milk themselves, because of breast milk's nutritional and biological properties.Tests were also under way to establish if the bacteria detected were identical and [if there is] a common source.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Tests that are said to be underway are likely genotyping the _Bacillus cereus_ isolates from the infected babies and the suspected source, that is, banked breast milk, to establish a common source for the outbreak. More information on this matter from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.Please see my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post (Bacillus cereus, anthrax-like infection - Africa: wildlife, livestock 20160908.4475451). Premature infants are an additional high risk group for infection due to this organism. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1871>.]
