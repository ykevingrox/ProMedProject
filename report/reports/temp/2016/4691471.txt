""I flew home that night and went straight to the Tweed Heads hospital.""LH began the month-long treatment that required weekly injections of the vaccine and infusions of immunoglobulin before being cleared of rabies [see Australian PEP recommendations below in the comment. - Mod.LM]Now she cautions travellers about the dangers.Australia is one of the few countries without rabies but the deadly virus is right on our doorstep. More than 300 travellers from NSW were exposed to rabies after an animal bite in 2015.The vaccine costs AUD 300 [about USD 225].Monkey and dog bites were the most common and all 303 people who were bitten required immediate post exposure rabies vaccine on their return to Australia.[Byline: Jane Hansen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Bali is part of Indonesia and is known to have many cases of rabies.Rabies can affect almost any mammal. This woman was wise to start her post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) immediately. While there is a short window, it is not a 24 hours short window, but given flight times/availability and being able to get home, this was still likely a wise decision.Typically the PEP is: a 1.0 mL dose of rabies vaccine is given IM in the deltoid area of adults or the anterolateral thigh of young children on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 of the rabies PEP regimen. The 1st vaccination is given concurrently with the HRIG (human rabies immune globulin) but at a site distant from that of the HRIG. The CDC recommends administration of HRIG at 20 IU/kg body weight. If anatomically feasible, the full dose should be infiltrated around and into the wound(s), and any remaining volume should be administered at an anatomical site (intramuscular [IM]) distant from vaccine administration. Australia's recommendations appear quite similar as cited at:<http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-16#4-16-4>: ""In persons previously unvaccinated, the recommended schedule for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for immunocompetent persons consists of 4 doses of vaccine. The 1st dose of vaccine is given as soon as practicable (day 0), and subsequent doses are given on days 3, 7, and 14; deviations of a few days from this schedule are probably unimportant. The recommended schedule for PEP for previously unvaccinated immunocompromised persons consists of 5 doses of vaccine. The 1st dose of vaccine is given as soon as practicable (day 0), and subsequent doses are given on days 3, 7, 14 and 28; deviations of a few days from this schedule are probably unimportant.""It is well established that rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is effective before the appearance of clinical symptoms of rabies, ""regardless of the time interval between exposure and initiation,"" (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, MMWR, 2010). This fact should be brought to public awareness beyond the fact that post-exposure vaccinations should be initiated as soon as possible: ""It is never too late!"" - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/556>.]
