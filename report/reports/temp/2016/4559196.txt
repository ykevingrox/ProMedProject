Lakeshore Weekly News [edited]<http://www.swnewsmedia.com/lakeshore_weekly/news/local/source-of-hopkins-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-found/article_8bceeab3-fe3d-5dee-822a-7a335abb5856.html>Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) officials announced they have identified the likely source of the legionnaires' disease outbreak in Hopkins [Hennepin County]. According to the MDH, the likely source is a set of cooling towers at Citrus Systems, Inc, located in the 400 block of 11th Ave South. Citrus Systems is a [beverage and juice] manufacturer that moved into its current 132 000 square foot [12 263 sq m] warehouse, manufacturing, and office space in 2013.MDH investigators based their conclusion on the distribution of cases and their exposure histories (where they live, work, or otherwise were in Hopkins) and the test results of water samples taken from the Citrus Systems cooling towers.Laboratory testing showed the strain of legionella bacteria found in one of the cooling towers matched the strain of bacteria in samples taken from patients linked to the outbreak. Legionella bacteria cause legionnaires' disease. Other cooling towers in the outbreak area were sampled, but did not have the specific legionella strain identified.MDH, working with Hennepin County Public Health and the City of Hopkins, confirmed [26 Sep 2016] that Citrus Systems had cooling towers, following a tip from the public. Water samples were collected and the towers were chemically cleaned and disinfected the following day. The MDH Public Health Laboratory found positive bacterial growth for legionella from one of Citrus Systems' 2 towers. Isolates were then analyzed further, using pulse field gel electrophoresis testing and whole genome sequencing to obtain a DNA fingerprint of the specific strain. The DNA fingerprint of the isolates exactly matched the DNA fingerprint of legionella isolates from 4 patients. New York's Wadsworth Public Health Laboratory and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (CDC) assisted in analyzing and comparing the samples. ""The lab testing is highly specific and provides us with great confidence that this tower is the source of infection,"" said MDH deputy state epidemiologist Richard Danila.Citrus Systems has cooperated fully with all agencies involved in the investigation, cleaning and disinfecting its towers promptly after being contacted by health officials. The company is working with MDH to ensure their system is working correctly. MDH has recommended retesting of the cooling tower so that any problems can be quickly identified.Health officials noted that Citrus has a management plan in place for its cooling towers and works with a qualified contractor for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the system. ""We don't know in this case exactly what went wrong to cause the build-up of legionella,"" Danila said. ""This situation clearly demonstrates how difficult it can be to keep systems free of legionella, even when they are well-maintained.""Overall, the geographic distribution of cases was consistent with community-wide exposure to a contaminated aerosol. Patient and family interviews did not identify a common exposure among the cases other than living, working, or spending time in the outbreak area.The outbreak sickened a total of 23 people; 17 were hospitalized and one person died. The last case became ill on [22 Sep 2016]. There have not been any further outbreak-related cases of legionnaires' disease. ""Although it's been more than 14 days since the tower was sanitized and since our last case, which is beyond the typical 10-day incubation period for [legionnaires' disease], it's still possible we could see an additional case if someone were exposed on [27 Sep 2016, the day the Citrus cooling towers were remediated],"" Danila said. ""It often takes time for cases to present for care and be tested. However, we believe the source has been identified and remediation has occurred.""MDH recommends that all building managers and owners in Minnesota develop a water management program for their cooling towers according to industry standards.[byline: A Schwarz]--communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>******[2]Date: Wed 12 Oct 2016 4:21 PM CDTSource: MPR News [edited]<https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/10/12/hopkins-legionnaires-outbreak-source-identified>A beverage processing plant in Hopkins has been identified as the likely source of a legionnaires' disease outbreak in that community. Samples from a single cooling tower at Citrus Systems, Inc, contained legionella bacteria, which causes legionnaires' disease, public health investigators said [on Wed 12 Oct 2016]. The company's products aren't affected.The bacteria exactly matched the strain taken from patients who contracted the respiratory infection, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. The company's cooling tower is located in the heart of Hopkins' legionnaires' cases, said Richard Danila, deputy state epidemiologist. ""Some [cases were] within a block or 2 and others a little further away,"" said Danila. 23 people were sickened in the outbreak. One person died. All of them lived or worked in Hopkins, or visited the city during the 10 days before they became ill.The outbreak is considered over, though the Health Department says there's still a remote chance that more cases of illness could emerge. The Hopkins cases nearly broke a legionnaires' outbreak record for the state set 2 decades ago. In 1995 a legionnaires' disease cluster in Luverne climbed to 24 confirmed cases -- the most ever in Minnesota. That same summer a separate outbreak in Mankato sickened 17 people.Legionnaires' disease is contracted by inhaling water mist contaminated with legionella bacteria. Cooling towers are often identified as a breeding ground for the bacteria. That was the source of the 1995 outbreaks in Luverne and Mankato, Danila said. ""We know from previous outbreaks that the water mist from these cooling towers can be picked up by the wind and carried some distance,"" Danila said. ""And within that mist would be the bacteria that you would breathe deep into your lungs.""The Health Department said Citrus Systems already works with a qualified contractor to maintain its cooling system. Investigators don't know what went wrong at the cooling plant. ""These cooling towers are complicated systems and it's not clear exactly what leads to growth sometimes,"" Danila said. ""Sometimes there's an obvious break in disinfection, but that was not the case here. This was a fully functioning, fully maintained system.""The company has disinfected its cooling towers and will set up a routine testing schedule to make sure legionella doesn't return, Danila said. Cooling towers at other Hopkins businesses were also sampled as part of the investigation, but the Health Department said none had the specific legionella strain linked to the outbreak.[byline: Lorna Benson]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Thu 13 Oct 2016From: Richard Danila <richard.danila@state.mn.us> [edited]All 23 patients were diagnosed by urinary antigen [for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1]. Working with clinicians we were able to obtain lower respiratory specimens from 4 of the cases. All 4 were _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 and all 4 matched exactly by PFGE [pulse field gel electrophoresis] and 100 per cent by whole genome sequencing to each other and to 2 positive cultures for _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 from the same cooling tower [Citrus Systems Inc West Tower]. None of other cooling towers tested positive. That same tower that had positive _ L. pneumophila_ cultures also had water positive for _Legionella_ by PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. Also the distribution of case exposures fit best with this [cooling] tower.--Richard N Danila, PhDAssistant State EpidemiologistMinnesota Department of HealthUSA<richard.danila@state.mn.us>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Danila for submitting data on the outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Hopkins, Minnesota. He has been in charge of investigating this outbreak.ProMED-mail also thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.We are told in the reports above that all 23 cases of legionnaires' disease in Hopkins, Minnesota were confirmed to be due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 by urinary antigen testing and in 4 cases by culture. The genotype of the isolates from 1 of the 2 Citrus Systems cooling towers (the West Tower) also grew _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 and its genotype matched the genotype of the 4 clinical isolates. All of the 23 cases were said to live, work, or spend time in Hopkins, in proximity to the contaminated Citrus Systems West Tower. Other cooling towers in the outbreak area were sampled, but did not have the specific legionella strain identified. The West Tower was remediated on 27 Sep 2016; all of the other cooling towers in Hopkins have also been remediated. It is now 17 days since remediation of the West Tower with no additional cases. The outbreak has apparently ended.Hopkins, with a population of 17 591 in 2010, is a suburban city located in Hennepin County, 3 miles (4.8 km) west of the city of Minneapolis (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins,_Minnesota>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55433>.]
