PAHO/WHO Zika Epidemiological Update [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=35713&lang=en>Zika virus -- incidence and trends----------------------------------To date, 45 countries and territories have confirmed local, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus disease in the Region of the Americas since 2015. In addition, 5 countries in the Americas [Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America] have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases. Since the last Pan American Health Organization/ World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika Epidemiological Update on 29 Jul 2016, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, and the United States of America have confirmed vector-borne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector- borne) Zika virus cases, 2015-2016: Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; CuraÌ¤ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint BarthÌ©lemy; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).Highlighted below is a summary of the Zika epidemiological situation by sub-regions of the Americas. North AmericaIn the last 4 epidemiological weeks (EW), Mexico has presented a decreasing trend in confirmed Zika virus disease cases, while the United States of America has reported its 1st outbreak of autochthonous vector-borne Zika transmission in an area of the Miami-Dade County in the state of Florida.[CDC has issued an advisory for pregnant women to avoid non-essential travel to Miami Beach Florida following the identification of authocthonous transmission in Miami Beach.  <http://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html>.  A map showing the location of the transmission in Miami Beach can be found at <http://www.cdc.gov/zika/images/intheus/maps-zika-us/local-fl-1500px.jpg>. - Mod.MPP]Central AmericaIn all of the countries of Central America, a decreasing trend of cases has been observed in the last 4 weeks. The greatest increase in Zika virus disease cases in Central America occurred between late 2015 and early 2016. CaribbeanIn the Caribbean, the Zika virus epidemic began in early 2016 and up to EW 32 of 2016 a downward trend is observed, with the exception of St. BarthÌ©lemy and Saint Martin. The evolution in the following weeks will confirm if the trend of declining cases will continue. Additionally, in the past 4 weeks, 4 additional countries/territories have confirmed the autochthonous circulation of Zika. South AmericaIn South America, all countries are reporting decreasing numbers of Zika virus disease cases.

Brazil to investigate if other factors act with Zika to cause congenital defects.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Brazilian government has launched an investigation to find out if factors other than Zika virus disease were involved in the development of microcephaly in some fetuses after noting an uneven distribution of cases across the country.In spring this year [2016] the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that Zika infection during pregnancy was linked with microcephaly as well as congenital blindness, stillbirth, and other fetal abnormalities. The acknowledgement came a year after the 1st case of Zika infection was confirmed in Brazil.But scientists in Brazil have been puzzled by the fact that cases of congenital Zika syndrome have clustered in the north-east part of the country, and that the expected surge in cases elsewhere in the country has not happened.Of the 1749 confirmed cases of microcephaly or other central nervous system birth defects, 85 percent were concentrated in the north east, according to a report by the ministry of health, released in late July. A 5th of confirmed cases (376) were in Pernambuco state, in the north east of Brazil.The country's 2nd most populated state, Minas Gerais, in east-central Brazil, has recorded just 4 cases of malformation from Zika virus infection while SÌ£o Paulo, the most populated state, has confirmed just 11 cases.Fatima Marinho, coordinator of epidemiological analysis and information at Brazil's ministry of health, said that the data suggested that there may be other factors at play. ""We started to think that in this area [northeast] maybe something more than Zika is causing this intensity and severity. We're not ruling anything out,"" she said.If the Zika virus was the only cause, then cases of microcephaly would have grown at the same rate throughout the country, she said.Marinho told The BMJ that the ministry was creating a database of information about the families affected by microcephaly in collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle.""We hope this population analysis will enable us to give a direction to our work,"" she said.Alexandre Chiavegatto Filho, a professor of health statistics at the University of SÌ£o Paulo, said that Brazil and the rest of the world needed to do more research on this topic. ""There's a lot that we still don't know about this association,"" he said.One possibility was that poor hygiene could be a risk factor. More than 70 percent of women who have had babies with microcephaly were poor, young, and lived in small cities or on the outskirts of big ones.Esper Kallas, a professor at the University of Sao Paulo, suggested that co-infections of Zika and other flaviviruses, such as dengue, might be interacting to cause the high rate of birth defects in the north-east.Another theory is that bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) may be implicated. Adriana Melo and her colleagues at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro reported on 15 Jul [2016] that they had found BVDV in the brains of 3 fetuses with microcephaly.Mayana Zatz, a geneticist and professor at the University of Sao Paulo, and her team were analysing genetic material from mothers and babies to try to explain a possible ""preference"" of the Zika virus for some people. She was investigating 8 pairs of twins. In 6 cases, one twin was born with microcephaly and the other without.Other researchers were investigating whether infection with yellow fever could offer protection against the damaging effects of the Zika virus. Kallas, however, was sceptical. He said that there were many areas with low vaccination rates against yellow fever with few cases of microcephaly.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It would be interesting to know if similar geographic and demographic differences in other countries also have unequal distribution of microcephaly cases. The results of the ongoing studies in Brazil are awaited with interest. - Mod.TY]******[3] Microcephaly, Puerto RicoDate: Fri 19 Aug 2016Source: JAMA Pediatr.

Estimating the Number of Pregnant Women Infected With Zika Virus and Expected Infants With Microcephaly Following the Zika Virus Outbreak in Puerto Rico, 2016.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Importance. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects, and it has been associated with other adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.Objective. To estimate the number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Puerto Rico and the number of associated congenital microcephaly cases.Design, Setting, and Participants. We conducted a modeling study from April to July 2016. Using parameters derived from published reports, outcomes were modeled probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. We used uncertainty distributions to reflect the limited information available for parameter values. Given the high level of uncertainty in model parameters, interquartile ranges (IQRs) are presented as primary results. Outcomes were modeled for pregnant women in Puerto Rico, which currently has more confirmed ZIKV cases than any other US location.Exposure. Zika virus infection in pregnant women.Main Outcomes and Measures. Number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV and number of congenital microcephaly cases.Results. We estimated an IQR of 5900 to 10Ûø300 pregnant women (median, 7800) might be infected during the initial ZIKV outbreak in Puerto Rico. Of these, an IQR of 100 to 270 infants (median, 180) may be born with microcephaly due to congenital ZIKV infection from mid-2016 to mid-2017. In the absence of a ZIKV outbreak, an IQR of 9 to 16 cases (median, 12) of congenital microcephaly are expected in Puerto Rico per year.Conclusions and Relevance. The estimate of 5900 to 10Ûø300 pregnant women that might be infected with ZIKV provides an estimate for the number of infants that could potentially have ZIKV-associated adverse outcomes. Including baseline cases of microcephaly, we estimated that an IQR of 110 to 290 total cases of congenital microcephaly, mostly attributable to ZIKV infection, could occur from mid-2016 to mid-2017 in the absence of effective interventions. The primary limitation in this analysis is uncertainty in model parameters. Multivariate sensitivity analyses indicated that the cumulative incidence of ZIKV infection and risk of microcephaly given maternal infection in the 1st trimester were the primary drivers of both magnitude and uncertainty in the estimated number of microcephaly cases. Increased information on these parameters would lead to more precise estimates. Nonetheless, the results underscore the need for urgent actions being undertaken in Puerto Rico to prevent congenital ZIKV infection and prepare for affected infants.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Efforts to control vector mosquitoes may be helpful in reducing the numbers of cases but is unlikely to eliminate the mosquitoes. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure at this time. Occurrence of cases of microcephaly and other fetal malformations is likely, placing demands on affected families and society in general. - Mod.TY]******[4] Caring for affected infantsDate: Sat 20 Aug 2016Source: NEJM Journal Watch [edited]<http://www.jwatch.org/fw111941/2016/08/20/zika-mosquito-transmission-miami-beach-updated-guidance>On Friday [19 Aug 2016], the CDC updated its guidance for U.S. clinicians on evaluating and managing infants whose mothers may have been infected by the Zika virus while pregnant.The guidance, published in MMWR [<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6533e2.htm>], includes the following changes and additions:- The document includes new information on how to interpret infants' lab results.- For mothers with confirmed Zika infection, a cranial ultrasound of the infant is recommended, even when a prenatal ultrasound from the 3rd trimester was normal.- New recommendations are provided on the outpatient management of infants with confirmed congenital Zika syndrome in their 1st year of life.- Infants with confirmed infection should undergo repeat eye and hearing assessments in addition to an endocrine evaluation.- Coordinated care with a multidisciplinary team along with a medical home should be provided for families affected by Zika [virus infections].[Byline: Kelly Young, Edited by David G.

The 2 leukodepleted platelet units were irradiated with 25 Gy delivered by an IBL-437C gamma irradiator (Cis Bio International) and were transfused in different patients on 19 Jan [2016] (day 0). On 21 Jan [2016], the donor called the blood bank to report a cutaneous rash, retro-orbital pain, and pain in both knees that had begun on 18 Jan [2016].Molecular sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV RNA isolated from the donor and from the 2 patients confirmed the identity of their ZIKV isolates. Serologic data supported the findings from the molecular analysis.--Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>******[6] Virus persistence in semenDate: Thu 11 Aug 2016Source: Euro Surveill. 2016;21(32):pii=30314.

Persistent detection of Zika virus RNA in semen for six months after symptom onset in a traveller returning from Haiti to Italy, February 2016.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SummaryA man in his early 30s reported in January 2016 a history of fever, asthenia and erythematous rash during a stay in Haiti. On his return to Italy, ZIKV RNA was detected in his urine and saliva 91 days after symptom onset, and in his semen on day 188, 6 months after symptom onset. Our findings support the possibility of sexual transmission of ZIKV and highlight the importance of continuing to investigate non-vector-borne ZIKV infection.DiscussionBecause of prolonged detection of ZIKV RNA and isolation of replication-competent virus in semen, the testes are considered an immunoprivileged replication site for ZIKV. Seminal shedding of ZIKV seems to coincide with the duration of spermatogenesis (69-80 days), suggesting a hypothesis of infection of sperm progenitors and viral shedding during the differentiation process. Our results showed the persistence of ZIKV RNA for 188 days after symptom onset, but this is not sufficient to support a hypothesis of ZIKV RNA being present in sperm progenitors until spermatozoa are fully differentiated and eliminated. Further studies are needed in order to understand persistence of ZIKV in semen and the potential risk of ZIKV sexual transmission.--Communicated by:Emanuele Nicastri MD, PhDUOC Divisione di Malattie Infettive ad ElevataIntensitÌÊ di Cura e Altamente ContagioseINMI SpallanzaniRomaItaly
