The newly reported cases are both from Riyadh province, one from Alkharj and the other from Riyadh city; both newly reported deaths were in patients from Buraidah, and the newly reported recovery was from Riyadh. This is now day 4 that there are no newly reported cases from Buraidah.Of the 22 cases reported from Buraidah since 3 Mar 2016, there have been 12 deaths for a case fatality rate of 54.5 percent, higher than the reported national case fatality rate. This may be a function of small number phenomenon or it may be a function of delayed recognition and management of cases (see below for further discussion). - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia, Buraidah outbreak - MOH 15 Mar 2016Date: 15 Mar 2016Source: Saudi MOH weekly monitor for MERS Vol.2 Issue 11 [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/Documents/Volume-2-Issue-11-Tuesday-March-15-2016.pdf>An Outbreak of MERS in Qassim:A recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) occurred in Qassim Region.Editorial comment:MERS had caused multiple large Health-care Associated Infections (HAIs) and outbreaks. Within about 3 weeks (22 Feb-12 Mar 2016), 23 cases of MERS were reported from Qassim Region, predominantly from one hospital (Figure 1 [available at source URL]) [the count in the table below as well as the tally from MOH reports is a total of 22 cases. - Mod.MPP]. The cases included 5 primary cases, 12 secondary cases and 6 healthcare workers (HCWs). The recent outbreak of MERS in Qassim and occurrence of 18 HAIs, including 6 healthcare workers (HCWs), is an event that raised many issues for reconsideration. Only 4 secondary cases of MERS have been reported from different Ministry of Health (MoH) hospitals since the beginning of 2016. Occurrence of such a relatively large number of secondary cases within one hospital is disturbing.Preliminary results of an ongoing outbreak investigation indicated that diagnosis of MERS was confirmed rather late; especially for the 1st few cases of the disease. Some Emergency Room (ER) physicians considered MERS in their differential diagnoses. The overall implementation of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) within the hospital was probably insufficient.The concept of visual triaging is very simple, but MoH health facilities in Qassim could not implement it properly. This could be due to the difficulties in readjusting the designs of the entrances of the hospitals. The adherence of HCWs to IPC, particularly at the ER should be maintained at all times. ER doctors throughout the kingdom need to be reminded continuously about the case definitions of MERS. Resuscitation, intubation and suction of MERS patient as well as other aerosol generating procedures should not be done by HCWs with no Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at the ER. Likewise, this procedure should not be done in presence of immunocompromised patients, or in rooms with no negative pressure or a HEPA filter. In addition, the flow of health visitors; especially for immunecompromised patients, needs to be regulated. It has been hypothesized that apparently healthy visitors could transmit MERS-CoV infection to hospitalized patients; especially if they were not wearing masks, had asymptomatic MERS infection, lean to greet the patient or /and shed some droplets of saliva on the patients following religious prayers or recitation of verses of Quran.Improper collection of nasopharyngeal swabs would result in false negative laboratory results, delays confirmation of diagnosis of MERS, waste resources and may cost lives.MERS-CoV in KSA 2016*Region: No. Cases // No. Primary // No. Secondary // U.C.Qassim (16): 22 // 5 / 14 / 3Riyadh (3): 19 // 14 / 4 / 1Jeddah (1): 5 // 4 / 0 / 1Asir: 2 // 2 / 0 / 0Najran: 2 // 2 / 0 / 0Taif (1): 2 // 2 / 0 / 0Hail (1): 2 // 2 / 0 / 0Madinah: 1 // 1 / 0 / 0Bisha: 1 // 1 / 0 / 0Eastern Region (1): 1 // 1 / 0 / 0Al-Baha (1): 1 // 0 / 0 / 1Makkah: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Tabuk: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Al-Ahsaa: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Al-Joaf: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Jazan: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Northern Borders: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Qunfotha: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Hafr Al-Batin: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Qurayyat: 0 // 0 / 0 / 0Total: 58 // 34 / 18 / 6* No cases from 3 Jan 2016-12 Mar 2016.No. Case, Confirmed Symptomatic, U.C.: Unclassified cases[in parentheses are Nos. of cases reported in past week)[No. of cases reported in past week:]Total 24Symptomatic (S) 21Asymptomatic (AS) 3Healthcare worker (S) 3Healthcare Worker (AS) 3Reference recommendation: Liu S, Chan TC, Chu YT, Wu JT, Geng X, Zhao N, Cheng W, Chen E, King CC.

The editorial in the above weekly report provides a glimpse into the initial findings of the investigation of the nosocomial outbreak: delayed identification of the outbreak, improper specimen collection for laboratory testing, lack of PPE for healthcare workers, performance of respiratory procedures in areas exposing other patients/individuals, especially immunodeficient/immunosuppressed individuals to respiratory pathogens. The delayed identifiecation of the outbreak with apparent laboratory confirmation issues was also supported by the dates of events associated with the early cases as presented in yesterday's (14 Mar 2016) WHO update (see MERS-CoV (38): Saudi Arabia (RI, MK), RFI 20160314.4092319).In keeping with the data presented in the above weekly update (and in synch with the daily reports of the MOH), there have been a total of 58 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2016, including 34 primary cases, 18 secondary cases and 6 unclassified cases. In the past week, there have been 24 newly confirmed cases, of whom 6 were in healthcare workers (3 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic).A map showing the provinces/regions of Saudi Arabia can be seen at: <http://www.emapsworld.com/saudi-arabia-provinces-map.html>.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
