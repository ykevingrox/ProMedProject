They gathered at the designated spot in a friend's field but forgot to bring a water bottle. They found an empty pesticide spray box near the tubewell, washed it and filled it with water to mix drinks. As they drank the homemade alcohol, KS started feeling ill but the others attributed it to [alcohol] intoxication and kept drinking. They almost finished an entire bottle when KS started vomiting and fell to the ground. B also complained of stomach pain and started vomiting. When G and K also complained of stomach pain, G called the ambulance around 12:30am.The ambulance rushed to the spot to find 2 youth lying on the ground and the other 2 screaming in pain. They were rushed to the sector 6 general hospital. KS breathed his last on the way and B was referred to PGIMER, where he died on Tuesday evening [1 Mar 2016]. G and K were rushed to GMCH-32, Chandigarh.Police said KS's body was handed over to family members after postmortem while B's postmortem would be conducted on Wednesday. G and K are stable. A case was registered under the relevant sections.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Clinical signs of abdominal pain and vomiting are somewhat non-specific. So it is quite impossible to know what residue of chemical was in the container used as a water bottle or what the reaction with the alcohol was. Furthermore, we are assuming this is not methanol, which can be quite dangerous in its own right. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12460>.]
