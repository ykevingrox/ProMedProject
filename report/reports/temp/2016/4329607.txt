As mentioned in the previous ProMED-mail post, archive no. 20160704.4325545, there is only one report in the literature of a fatal reaction in an AIDS patient. That patient had a severe neurological reaction, in contrast with the rare viscerotropic reaction, YEL-AVD, that is fatal in 2/3rds of people affected who don't have an immune defect.In the face of an ongoing yellow fever epidemic, it is difficult if not impossible on clinical grounds to distinguish YEL-AVD from yellow fever itself. This may be an important reason that no YEL-AVD has been documented in AIDS patients despite the fact that hundreds of millions of HIV-infected people have been vaccinated. Should such cases be suspected, it would be important to obtain specimens for viral culture. If it is YEL-AVD, vaccine virus would be isolated. If it is [wild type] yellow fever, regular yellow fever virus would be found.Why make the effort? Current recommendations are that patients with CD4 counts below 200 should not be vaccinated. The choice between letting someone be exposed to a 20-60 percent risk of dying from yellow fever and the unknown increase in risk of an HIV-infected patient dying from YEL-AVD is a grim one. Clinical trials are difficult to initiate in this situation. Documenting the occurrence or non-occurrence of YEL-AVD or severe neurological reactions in inadvertently vaccinated HIV-infected individuals might influence the recommendations.--Stephen J. Seligman, M.D.Adjunct ProfessorSt. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious DiseasesThe Rockefeller UniversityNew York, NY 10065Research ProfessorNew York Medical CollegeValhalla, NY<sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu>[ProMED thanks Dr. Seligman for providing these comments.In practical terms in the field and in the midst of a yellow fever (YF) outbreak, I wonder how many potential vaccinees know that they are HIV positive and whether CD4 cell counts are done on them. I would guess very few. Operating an aggressive vaccination campaign with supporting surveillance and laboratory work in a situation like the one faced in Angola likely absorbs everyone's attention, making a prospective study to determine occurrence of YEL-AVD versus wild type YF beyond their capability. As Dr. Seligman points out, clinical trials are difficult to initiate in this situation. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>.][See Also:Yellow fever - Africa (78): Congo DR 20160705.4327358Yellow fever - Africa (77): Uganda, adverse vaccine effects 20160704.4325545Yellow fever - Africa (75): WHO, Uganda (MQ) 20160630.4319763Yellow fever - Africa (72): WHO 20160624.4308329Yellow fever - Africa (58): WHO 20160528.4250752Yellow fever - Africa (57): WHO 20160522.4237288Yellow fever - Africa (56): WHO, Uganda 20160518.4230607Yellow fever - Africa (55): WHO 20160514.4222137Yellow fever - Africa (52): WHO 20160506.4206937Yellow fever - Africa (51): Uganda, RFI 20160506.4204265Yellow fever - Africa (50): Uganda, WHO 20160503.4199924Yellow fever - Africa (48): current situation 20160430.4194719Yellow fever - Africa (47): Uganda, Kenya 20160429.4193015Yellow fever - Africa (46): Uganda, Kenya 20160427.4185740Yellow fever - Africa (45): Uganda, Kenya 20160423.4179151Yellow fever - Africa (44): Uganda 20160422.4177724Yellow fever - Africa (41): Uganda (MQ) susp, RFI 20160414.4159929Yellow fever - Africa (39): Uganda (MQ) 20160413.4157158Yellow fever - Africa (36): Uganda (MQ) 20160411.4153034].................................................dk/ty/msp/dk"
