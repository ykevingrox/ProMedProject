Hepatitis C is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the USA. An estimated 3 and a half million people are infected in the USA.For many years it was mainly reported in older generations, the Baby Boomers, infected with blood transfusions and organ transplants done before blood screening became widespread in 1992. The infection can also be spread by sharing needles and intravenous drug use and health officials say that's likely a factor in the spike in cases in adults age 18 to 29 in Alaska. Other parts of the state are also seeing a rise in young adults with hepatitis C, but Southeast has seen the biggest increase.[Byline: Joe Viechnicki]--Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed. There is no evidence that government sponsored needle exchange programs increase the amount of substance abuse. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206>.]
