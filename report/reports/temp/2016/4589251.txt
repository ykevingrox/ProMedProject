Thaivisa, Daily News [edited]<http://news.thaivisa.com/thailand/outbreak-of-rsv-in-korat-many-children-hospitalized/157635/>A doctor has given advice online as an outbreak of respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] has hit many children in [Nakhon] Ratchasima province.RSV is a fairly common lung disease especially in the rainy season. Its symptoms include fever and it can be serious to infants and old people in particular, reports Daily News.Dr Jirarut Chomcheuy said on his Facebook page (BigJira Praise) that ignorance of the disease is widespread.After a picture was posted of a one month old child with the infection he said that the main problem was that parents were ignorant. People need to realize that close proximity to siblings or others with the disease can result in the virus being passed on.While it was true that it was more prevalent in the rainy season that was only part of the problem. The main way to prevent it is to keep the vulnerable away from those who are infected.Out of 10 ICU [intensive care unit] beds at a Korat [Nakhon Ratchasima] hospital, 9 were filled with people suffering the effects of the virus. Sufferers needed respirators.The disease can last for a week and there is no vaccine available to treat it.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Thailand can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14342>. Nakhon Ratchasima province, also known as Korat, is one of the northeastern provinces of Thailand. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJA review of the global burden of RSV estimates an annual incidence of approximately 34 million episodes of ALRI (acute lower respiratory infections) associated with RSV infection in children aged younger than 5 years [1]. Just over 3 million episodes were estimated to result in hospitalization and between 66 000 and 199 000 in death [1]. Most deaths (99 percent) occur in the developing world [1]. Infants have consistently higher rates of RSV-associated illness and hospitalization than older children in both industrialized and developing nations [2]. The report above from Thailand is indicative of the RSV disease burden in various regions of the world.The high burden of RSV-associated morbidity and mortality makes the development of safe and effective vaccines a priority. Several candidates are in development. However, more information on the epidemiology of RSV is needed to inform control strategies [3].References----------1.
