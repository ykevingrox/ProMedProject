Navajo-Hopi Observer [edited]<http://nhonews.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&SubSectionID=1&ArticleID=17352> Navajo Nation Vice President Jonathan Nez met with officials from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) about public outreach, awareness and prevention of hantavirus and _Onchocerca lupi_ on the Navajo Nation [10 Feb 2016] in Atlanta, Georgia. Nez said the Navajo people must be proactive in prevention efforts after a girl from Cameron [Arizona; Navajo Nation] died from complications from hantavirus [13 Jan 2016].""We want to be proactive in this partnership,"" Nez said. ""We got the family relocated out of their home and into a Navajo Housing Authority home. Once it's time for spring cleaning, we must disclose full information on prevention of hantavirus and educate our Navajo people."" Del Yazzie, an epidemiologist with the Navajo Epidemiology Center, said the Navajo Nation is partnering with the counties and state of Arizona, including the federal government, to prevent hantavirus and also _O. lupi_, which involves infection of a parasitic worm that is transmitted by black flies -- an emerging threat on the Nation that infects dogs and humans.There have been 2 cases of _O. lupi_ on the Nation in Chinle, Arizona, and 2 cases in Farmington, New Mexico.A 22-month-old Navajo girl developed spinal lesions on her spinal cord and required emergency surgery to remove the nodule. Once removed, doctors found the _O. lupi_ worm.Dr. Heather Paulin, CDC Parasitic Diseases Branch EIS [Epidemic Intelligence Service] officer, said plans are underway to prevent _O. lupi_ infections on the Navajo Nation by working with tribal veterinary services. ""The idea is that we would try to collect blood samples from residents who own dogs and sample their dogs at the same time,"" she said. She said the CDC would like to partner with spay and neuter mobile services provided by Dr. Glenda Davis, who is with the Navajo Nation Veterinary Program. The CDC is working with the Navajo Technical University for the research project and upon approval will begin testing on the Navajo Nation. ""I am from western Navajo,"" Nez said. ""When I say people are scared, they are scared, especially after someone has died from the hantavirus. We are working with the experts and our dialogue in Atlanta will go a long way toward these prevention efforts.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Onchocerca lupi_ is well known in dogs, cats and horses in the United States, and a recent review can be found in Emerging Infectious Diseases 2015: Otranto D et al. Canine Infections with _Onchocerca lupi_ Nematodes, United States, 2011-2014. EID 2015;21(5):868-71; <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/5/14-1812_article>). A series of 6 cases were reported by Cantey PT et al. (The Emergence of Zoonotic _Onchocerca lupi_ Infection in the United States -- A Case-Series. Clin Infect Dis. 2015 Nov 26. pii: civ983. [Epub ahead of print])._O. lupi_ is an emerging human pathogen, and although in the same family as _Onchocerca volvulus_, which causes African river blindness, the nodules tend to be located deep in the body, whereas _O. volvulus_ nodules locate subcutaneously._O. volvulus_ has recently been linked to the nodding syndrome (Nodding syndrome -- we can now prevent it. Colebunders R, Irani J, Post R. Int J Infect Dis. 2016 Feb 1. pii: S1201-9712(16)00017-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2016.01.016. [Epub ahead of print]), although not through invasion of _O. volvulus_ adult worms or microfilariae. There are differential diagnoses like _Dirofilaria immitis_ and _D. repens_. Especially _D. repens_ seems to be increasing at least in Europe and _D. repens_ is more invasive and can be found in many tissues (Ermakova LA et al. _Dirofilaria repens_ in the Russian Federation: current epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment from a federal reference center perspective. Int J Infect Dis. 2014 Jun;23:47-52; <http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(14)01445-3/abstract>). Determining the species from a macroscopic examination is uncertain and therefore removed worms should be analyzed by sequencing.Serology is widely cross-reactive and, if using whole worm antigens, is not expected to be able to differentiate between _O. lupi_, _D. immitis_ and _D. repens_. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/207>.]
