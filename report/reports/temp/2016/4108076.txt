The Hindu[edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/two-patients-test-positive-for-monkey-fever/article8377527.ece>Two of the nearly 20 people from villages of Khanapur taluk [sub district, Karnataka], who were suspected to be infected by monkey fever [Kyasanur Forest disease, KFD] and were under treatment over the past week, have tested positive for the disease.According to district surveillance officer, Jagdish Nuchin, the National Institute of Virology, Pune had confirmed that 2 of the 3 samples of blood were infected by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV). While the officials of Health Department, Goa, had confirmed that 6 samples collected from the patients from Khanapur taluk under treatment in hospital in Goa had tested negative.Dr Nuchin said nearly 20 people from Amte, Chapoli, Madgai, and Kapoli villages under Kankumbi Primary Health Centre jurisdiction, nestled in forest areas in Karnataka-Goa border were infected by the KFD, commonly known as 'monkey fever'. While 12 of them were under treatment in Goa, others were shifted to government hospitals in Khanapur and Belagavi.Following confirmation of infection in 2 people, preventive measures had been taken for further spread of the disease in Amte, Chapoli, Kapoli, Madgai and other adjoining villages of Khanapur taluk, Dr Nuchin added.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is a tickborne viral disease transmitted from monkeys to humans through tick bites. High fever, joint pain, bleeding in the nose and gums are among the symptoms of the disease.Khanapur is a panchayat town [areas in transition form rural to urban] in Belgaum district, Karnataka, India. KFD is endemic in Karnataka state. Other than Karnataka state, antibodies against KFDV have also been detected in humans in several parts of Gujarat state and isolated localities like Ramtek (near Nagpur), Kingaon, and Parbatpur of West Bengal state of India (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7070563_Kyasanur_Forest_Disease_An_Epidemiological_View_in_India).This outbreak was first reported in Kyasanur Forest disease - India (06): (KA ex GA) RFI archive no. 20160317.4100645. According to this follow -up report, until now, 2 out of a total of 9 samples collected from people affected in this area have tested positive for KFD. Further information in this regard would be highly appreciated.Although the formalin inactivated vaccine available has been used for years to control KFD, the increasing trend of the disease in the last 5 years, irrespective of routine vaccination is alarming. There is clearly a requirement for development of safer and more effective vaccines, as well as a rapid diagnostic system for KFD for use in the field. - Mod.UBAMaps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42770>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
