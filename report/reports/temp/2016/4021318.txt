According to Foday Dafai, director of disease prevention and control at the health ministry, who spoke with AFP: ""All of them were tested before they were released, and they showed no signs and symptoms of the virus. With their release, nobody is in quarantine or admitted in any hospital for Ebola.""13 Feb 2016 USA, Liberia: Post-Ebola, U.S. soldiers still working to build Liberian armed forces<http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/careers/army/2016/02/13/post--ebola-us-soldiers-still-working-build-liberian-armed-forces/80297844/>[Although it has been almost a year since the United States' military completed its mission to fight the spread of Ebola virus disease (EVD), American soldiers are still working in Liberia with the country's armed forces. US soldiers are now primarily working with the Operation Onward Liberty, with soldiers from the Michigan National Guard working side-by-side with their Armed Forces of Liberia counterparts to train, advise and build capacity.The name of the program is Operation United Assistance. According to Major Michael Miller, chief of the Office of Security Cooperation in Liberia, ""The key function Onward Liberty provides us is day-to-day partners who sit on the staff with the Armed Forces of Liberia headquarters, someone who's a trusted mentor and adviser.""]14 Feb 2016 Viet Nam (Ho Chi Minh City) ex Sierra Leone: Suspected Ebola case<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/14/c_135096299.htm>[According to local media on Sun [14 Feb 2016], a 27-year-old man was quarantined in the Ho Chi Minh City Tropical Diseases, a Ho Chi Minh hospital, after coming back from Africa with symptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD).According to the online media source VnExpress, the man -- who worked as a photographer in Sierra Leone -- was from central Binh Thuan province and arrived at Tan Son Nhat international airport in the city on [11 Feb 2016] with EVD symptoms, including high fever and dry cough. The man was being treated as a tuberculosis patient. Earlier, doctors in Sierra Leone had diagnosed his illness as pneumonia.[Early Ebola symptoms are non-specific, so this man may not have EVD. It is good he has been tested for confounding agents such as malaria and TB, but other etiologic agents are also possible. - Mod.LK]Funding------11 Feb 2016 Liberia: Effects of Ebola linger as budget cutbacks threaten unrest in Liberia<http://www.forbes.com/sites/riskmap/2016/02/12/effects-of-ebola-linger-as-budget-cutbacks-threaten-unrest-in-liberia/#2322bb777ae3>[According to Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the budget will drop by 11 percent in the coming year to accommodate a sharp reduction in revenue.

That allowed EVD to spread rapidly, unhindered by fragile health systems collapsing under its challenge.In Sierra Leone, that early-warning system (Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, or IDSR) had existed since 2003, but was essentially dormant when the 2014 EVD outbreak occurred. The WHO (World Health Organization) worked with the government to bring it up to date, adapt it for EVD, and train health workers across the country to use it. The effectiveness of the system in identifying and responding to cases sooner was a crucial step in lessening the outbreak.WHO is now assisting Sierra Leone's government to expand the system to track 26 priority diseases, including cholera, measles, malaria, typhoid fever, as well as women who die in childbirth. The system is already reaping rewards. On 11 Jan 2016, the system alerted a sudden increase of watery diarrhea and vomiting in Kania, a remote village in Kambia district near the border with Guinea. Within 8 hours, a team of investigators from the WHO, the Ministry of Health, and the United Nations Children's Fund was on site, making sure infection prevention measures were in place to help prevent further cases.The IDSR training was critical to ensure prompt reporting. According to Dr Foday Sesay, Kambia's District Medical Officer, ""It is good that we now have the IDSR system in place to serve as a major trigger for prevention and response. The ongoing investigation of the suspected cases, planning and preparedness that are happening were triggered because our health workers at the facility level were able to detect an unusual event, which, if they had missed it, could have derailed our health gains.""Research--------11 Feb 2016 UK: Researchers to use supercomputer to ""hack"" Ebola<http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-02/uol-rtu021116.php>University of Leeds scientists will run the equivalent of password cracking software to find the chemical keys of the Ebola virus (EBOV).
