In a statement [Mon 5 Sep 2016], Nova Scotia Health Authority confirmed a cluster of cases of hepatitis A associated with Kids & Company in Hammonds Plains and Grace Note Child Care Centre in Halifax. The agency said the source of the infection has yet to be determined.Medical Officer of Health Dr Gaynor Watson-Creed said health workers are working to identify potential additional cases in children, staff, and families who may have been exposed to the viral disease. The province is offering free hepatitis A vaccines to people who may have come in contact with the virus to help prevent them from getting sick.The health authority says the child care centres are working with provincial environment and education officials about cleaning procedures and other precautions to prevent further infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases in the children are not specifically stated but whatever the numbers are, the number of total cases is likely to be much higher as the infection is mostly asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice) in young children. Certainly day care centers are prime locations for enteric diseases to be transmitted as most of the children are not yet toilet trained.Prevention of this infection is best done by universal immunization of children with the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. - Mod.LLMaps of Canada can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5937>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
