The Washington Post [edited]<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/10/23/like-something-out-of-a-horror-movie-flesh-eating-bacteria-infection-kills-man-in-four-days/>Many people get some form of vibriosis every year, usually from eating raw or undercooked shellfish, according to the CDC. For most, the worst symptoms are diarrhea and vomiting. One man was one of the unlucky ones.On 11 Sep 2016, he was in Ocean City, Maryland cleaning his crab pots as he and his wife prepared to return to their winter home in Phoenix [Arizona], according to the Daily Times of Salisbury, [Maryland]. But somewhere in the murky water lurked a potentially deadly bacterium, _Vibrio vulnificus_. It came in contact with a cut on his leg, and within hours he began to feel ill. The infection moved rapidly. Days later, ulcerated and full of lesions, it was ""like something out of a horror movie,"" his wife told the newspaper. The bacterium was in his bloodstream. ""The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions,"" according to the Florida Department of Health's vibriosis page [<http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html>]. ""Aggressive attention should be given to the wound site; for patients with wound infections, amputation of the infected limb is sometimes necessary.""Doctors diagnosed the infection quickly, and the patient was flown to a shock trauma hospital in Baltimore, where doctors amputated his leg. But it was too late. He died on 15 Sep 2016, 4 days after cleaning out the crab pots. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is investigating the matter, the newspaper reported, but hasn't issued an advisory. In 2014, officials issued a warning during a state record outbreak in the Chesapeake Bay.[Byline: Cleve R Wootson Jr]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24213>.]
