Swissinfo [edited]<http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bite-spree_tick-bites-and-lyme-disease-on-the-rise/42389776>Physicians in Switzerland have seen a sharp increase in the number of tick bites as well as cases of Lyme disease this year [2016]. As of the end of July [2016], doctors across the nation had treated 22 000 people for tick bites. In comparison, the whole of 2015 saw just 14 300 visits, according to the Federal Office of Public Health. The figure is the highest since the office started recording tick bite cases in 2008.The high number of tick bites is also associated with a higher number of Lyme disease cases. So far this year [2016] there have been 8400 cases of acute Lyme disease. In 2015 the figure was 5300, and there were 8700 cases in 2013 -- considered a particularly bad year for tick-related illnesses.Meanwhile, 119 people have contracted tick-borne encephalitis this year [2016]. In recent years, the annual figures have fluctuated between 40 and 170 cases. There is a vaccination for tick-borne encephalitis, but not for Lyme disease.Mild temperatures in January and February gave the tick season a jump start this year [2016]. Ticks are active from 7 deg C [44.6 deg F], and their ""high season"" is typically May and June. The most common type of tick found in Switzerland is the wood tick, also known as the American dog tick [but dog ticks/wood ticks are not known to transmit Lyme disease - Mod.LM].The Swiss league for patients with tick-borne diseases recommends that people prevent tick bites by avoiding bushes and tall grass, by wearing clothing that covers the arms, legs, and feet, and by checking the body carefully for ticks and their larvae.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex, a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (<http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf>). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.The species of tick, the host species, borrelial genospecies, and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans, although _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the most common pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. It also occurs in Europe, but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.Individual ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex. In Europe, _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries, the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 13.7 percent (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>): Regions with the highest infection rates are located in central Europe (Austria, Czech Republic, southern Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Slovenia); The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6 percent ) was considerably higher infection rate than in nymphs (10.1 percent). In Switzerland, 13.6 to 49 percent of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region, of positive ticks, 25 percent were infected with _B. afzelii_, 44 percent with _B. garinii_, and 25 percent with _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. No significant difference was seen when the prevalence of each _Borrelia_ species in nymphs was compared to that in adults (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>). - Mod.MLInformation about tick-borne diseases in Switzerland can be found at <https://www.ch.ch/en/ticks/>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105>.]
