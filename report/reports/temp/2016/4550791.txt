Africa Review [edited]<http://www.africareview.com/news/Angola-launches-yellow-fever-vaccination/979180-3411608-9kohe4/>[On Mon 10 Oct 2016] Angola  launched a yellow fever vaccination drive targeting 2 157 202 people in 10 provinces. In August [2016], the government conducted a similar campaign in 12 provinces. According to a statement by the health ministry, the campaign will run in 2 phases.It is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNICEF, the Red Cross, and Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors Without Borders).The 1st phase between [Mon 10 Oct 2016] and [Sat 15 Oct 2016] will cover Benguela, Cuanza Sul, Cuanza Norte, Namibe, Cunene, and Lunda Norte provinces with some 1 157 202 people targeted. The 2nd phase from [Sat 17 Oct 2016] will cover Bengo, BiÌ©, Lunda Sul, and Moxico provinces, with more than 1 million people targeted.The new vaccination areas will only include priority municipalities with high local risk of transmission, the health ministry pointed out in the statement, adding that some of the target areas border other countries. According to WHO, the yellow fever cases in DR Congo were imported from Angola.Since February [2016], 16 million have been vaccinated against yellow fever in Angola's 73 municipalities. Angola has 162 municipalities spread along 18 provinces. The southern African country has a population of 26 million.The Red Cross in July [2016] launched a USD 1.4 million emergency appeal to fight the spread of yellow fever in Angola. Angola was facing its worst yellow fever outbreak in 30 years. Up to 356 people have died in the country with more than 3400 infected since late last year [2015].Yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, usually the _Aedes aegypti_ species, that also spread the Zika virus. A vaccine can prevent infection, but there is no specific drug treatment for those infected.[byline: Arnaldo Vieira]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Angola has been at risk of isolated flare-ups particularly in more isolated areas. A 7 Oct 2016 WHO report (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20161007.4544742) indicates that 32 probable cases were reported in the past 4 weeks. If these cases are confirmed and not shown to be sylvan spillover cases, it is an indication that virus circulation continues in Angola. A significant vaccination campaign is the best measure to prevent a resumption of the larger outbreak. Apparently, there is an adequate supply of vaccine for the 2 phases of the campaign. The report does not indicate if full doses will be administered or if dose sparing (1/5 of the usual volume) will be used, as it has been recently in the DR Congo. Continued surveillance backed by laboratory support in Angola is essential to detect cases early on and mount a timely vaccination response. - Mod.TYMaps of Angola can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
