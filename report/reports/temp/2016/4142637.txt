The New Mexico Department of Health says it's the 2nd case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] in the state this year [2016]. An environmental investigation will be conducted at the patient's home to help reduce the risk to others. The name of the victim wasn't released Tuesday [5 Apr 2016].Hantavirus [infection can cause] a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. People can contract the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus. Health officials say the deer mouse is the main carrier for the hantavirus strain found in New Mexico.Since 1993, New Mexico has reported 103 lab-confirmed HPS cases with 43 deaths. That's the highest number of cases of any state.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The hantavirus responsible for this and previous cases was not specified but undoubtedly was Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) there. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, with case fatality rates of over 30 percent.The public needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important during spring and summer, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts. Previous posts this year indicate that increased precipitation due to El NiÌ±o climate effects may have an effect on mouse habitat, with increased exposure of humans in the region due to related increases in populations of Sin Nombre hantavirus-infected mice (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160116.3942572).An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.The US State of New Mexico can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/207>and there is a map showing the location of Cibola County in New Mexico at <http://geology.com/county-map/new-mexico.shtml>. - Mod.TY]
