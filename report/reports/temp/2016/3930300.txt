CIDRAP [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/01/news-scan-jan-11-2016>According to the 1st-ever global burden estimates for melioidosis, the disease is sharply underreported in 45 endemic countries; it is probably endemic in 34 more, and conditions are suitable for the disease in parts of the USA and Japan. The study, published on 11 Jan 2016 in Nature Microbiology, has practical implications for the USA, given the 2014 outbreak linked to the Tulane Primate Research Center in Louisiana.The findings are based on reports of human and animal cases, reports of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, the bacterium that causes the disease, in the environment, and modeling that takes into account factors such as environmental suitability. Researchers estimate that there are about 165 000 cases each year worldwide, 89 000 of them fatal, a level that calls for new policy and public health steps to battle the disease, they write.The report includes a map of highest-risk zones, which include Southeast and South Asia, tropical Australia, west sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. The researchers also said the USA and Japan are among 44 countries where the disease is absent but where soil and other conditions are suitable for the disease. The US risk area is in the southern parts of Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. For Japan, risk areas are Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures.When the investigators looked specifically at the area around the Tulane lab, they noted that the risk is very low for the facility, but moderately high for New Orleans, leading to the estimation that _B. pseudomallei_ could become established in the state if it were released widely.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This newly published paper (Limmathurotsakul D, Goldring N, Dance DAB, et al: Predicted global distribution of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and burden of melioidosis.
