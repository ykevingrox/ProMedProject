GCS (Government Information Bureau) [in Chinese, trans. Rappt.DS, edited]<http://www.gcs.gov.mo/showNews.php?PageLang=C&DataUcn=98683>Health Services has received the latest news from mainland health agencies that Beijing has a new case of imported yellow fever (YF). The patient is 29 years old, male, of Nantong City in Jiangsu Province. He works routinely in Angola and Namibia. On [5 Apr 2016] he developed fever and other symptoms in Angola and sought treatment locally. His symptoms did not improve. On [9 Apr 2016], nucleic acid testing conducted locally [in Angola] was positive for YF. He then flew for treatment to Beijing via Dubai. On [12 Apr 2016], based on the patient's history, clinical presentation and nucleic acid testing results, the patient was confirmed to be a case of imported YF. His condition is currently stable.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver[The appearance of yet another YF case in China coming from Angola raises serious questions about YF vaccination coverage of the thousands of Chinese workers in that African country. Reaching these workers may be difficult there. In the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20160403.4136699), Dan Silver commented:""1. All 3 of these [previously reported] patients are, again, Chinese citizens doing ""business"" (or ""trading"") in Angola. The implication is that they don't work for big companies. They may be traveling independently to Angola (possibly even via 3rd countries) and not receiving vaccinations prior to arrival, i.e. falling through the cracks.""2. At least 2 of them developed symptoms in Angola before returning to China, but were missed at the airport when they entered China, despite being ill.""3. Chinese citizens who fall ill in Angola want to head back to China for treatment (perhaps especially independent business people). I found a BBS [Bulletin Board System] posting recommending this -- head back to China if you think you have yellow fever, with details of what to expect/do once home.""The dengue virus transmission season in southern China, with the risk of YF virus transmission, is approaching quickly. One hopes that the YF outbreak in Angola, with its related Chinese cases, comes to an end soon. Chinese health authorities would be wise to require proof of YF vaccination for all individuals who have been traveling or working in YF endemic countries in order to be admitted into China. Better still, YF endemic countries should require proof of YF vaccination prior to admission of travelers.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.A map of China can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/33403>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.]
