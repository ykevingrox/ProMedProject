Flavivirus infections are virtually unknown. However, the introduction of Zika virus into Arica appears now to be only a matter of time given its presence in neighboring Bolivia and Peru, the trans-border travel into and the increasing residence within Arica from both countries. The virus is more temperature resistant than most other flaviviruses and may be transmitted via blood, semen, saliva and possibly respiratory aerosols._Aedes_ mosquitoes, the insect vector of Zika virus, were identified in Arica several weeks ago in diverse parts of the city and immediate vicinity. Recently a case of micro-encephalopathy and a series of GBS [Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome] cases were reported in the local hospital. In addition, children with fever in the homes where _Aedes_ were found were also admitted to hospital. Whilst health officials have said that the mosquitoes and blood from certain patients have been submitted for analysis, the results of those analyses have not been made public.Early detection and the elimination of potential local reservoirs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes could rapidly allow the area to return to a Zika-free, _Aedes_-free status. Waiting until the virus becomes endemic in the area, if indeed it has not done so already, will result in an increased burden on the local health care system, added costs for mosquito control, Zika surveillance, and the long-term treatment of GBS/microcephaly (estimated at 10 million dollars per single case of microcephaly) for many years to come. However, little of consequence on a broad scale has been done in Arica. The positive detection of Zika should prompt the authorities to take definitive action. Despite the need to notify the public, millions of dollars are being spent on the construction of hotels, casinos and a new shopping mall. By contrast, the cost of preventative measures employing state-of-the-art molecular systems would be modest compared to these expenditures and far less than the costs needed to deal with a full blown epidemic. In all likelihood, the virus is now ""sleep walking"" through the area and by the [time] people wake up, it will be too late.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[After decades of not being concerned about the risk of flaviviruses in Chile, the Arica situation may change that perception. At this point, 2 questions are critical. 1st, what is the species of _Aedes_ mosquito that has been detected? If it is _Ae. aegypti_, that is a cause for concern, since it is an efficient vector not only for Zika virus, but for dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses as well.2nd, what is the evidence for the presence of Zika virus infections? As the Brazilian experience shows, microcephaly can be caused by several factors both infectious and not. GBS can follow a variety of infections. Establishing a causal relationship to Zika virus infections is difficult.Arica is located in the far north of Chile, near the borders of Bolivia and Peru where _Ae. aegypti_ and Zika virus are present. It is a significant port for commerce for a large inland region of South America. The city serves a free port for Bolivia and facilitates a substantial part of that country's trade. The city's strategic position is enhanced by being next to the Pan-American Highway, being connected to both Tacna in Peru and La Paz in Bolivia by railroad and being served by an international airport. The city has a mild climate, and perhaps could support populations of _Ae. aegypti_. With the movement of goods and people into this hub, it would not be surprising if _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes had been introduced into the city and perhaps Zika virus as well. As of EW 23, Bolivia has reported 102 suspected and 11 confirmed cases and Peru 118 suspected and 77 confirmed cases of Zika virus infections (<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11603:countries-territories-zika-autochthonous-transmission-americas&Itemid=41696&lang=en>).ProMED would be very interested in receiving additional information about the mosquitoes and the presence of Zika virus in Arica. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1336>.][See Also:2015----Dengue/DHF update (18): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Middle East, blood donors 20150622.3455223Chikungunya (31): Americas, Africa 20151026.3745528].................................................ep/lm/ml/ty/je/ml"
