This is the 10th rabid animal reported within Middlesex County for 2016, but the 1st rabid animal reported in Spotswood.On Wed 29 Jun, a raccoon was found to be acting strangely and aggressively in a Spotswood resident's yard by 2 dogs and an altercation occurred. The raccoon was killed by the owner in the altercation and was sent to the New Jersey Department of Health Laboratory for testing.It was reported on Tue [5 Jul 2016] that the animal tested positive for rabies.

The 2 residents were given a letter to see a physician regarding possible rabies post exposure treatment.

Finally, be sure that all family pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and licenses.Rabies is caused by a virus which can infect all warm-blooded mammals, including humans. The rabies virus is found in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by a bite, or possibly by contamination of an open cut. New Jersey is enzootic for raccoon and bat variants of rabies. Bats, raccoons, skunks, groundhogs, foxes, cats, and dogs represent about 95 percent of animals diagnosed with rabies in the United States.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Rhode IslandDate: Wed 6 Jul 2016, 03:14 PMSource: The Westerly Sun [edited]<http://www.thewesterlysun.com/news/westerly/9058189-154/unidentified-animal-bites-westerly-walmart-patrons-rabies-feared.html>State health and wildlife officials warned area residents to be vigilant after an animal resembling a mink bit several customers Mon [4 Jul 2016] at the Wal-Mart on Post Road in Westerly.Officials from the state Departments of Health and Environmental Management said late Tue [5 Jul 2016] that ""several"" customers were bitten between 4 and 5 p.m. on the 4th of July. The agencies are asking anyone who may have had physical contact with a small, black mammal, either inside the Westerly Wal-Mart or in the immediate vicinity to contact the department during business hours at 401-222-2577 or outside of business hours at 401-272-5952.A press release from the agencies said at least 2 people were bitten, but neither came forward to seek treatment. Because the animal was not tested, state officials said they were are operating under the assumption that it could have rabies. The individuals who were bitten, and others who may have had contact with the animal, are at risk of rabies exposure and should be evaluated, the authorities said.Once symptoms appear, rabies is fatal in people and in animals. Rabies immunization must be started as soon as possible after exposure. The public is reminded to always:- Make sure all pet dogs, cats, and ferrets are up to date on rabies vaccinations, as required by state law.- Avoid all contact with stray, wild, or free-roaming domestic animals, and avoid feeding these animals.- Avoid feeding pets outdoors; as this will attract other animals (this is especially dangerous when feeding groups of free-roaming cats).- Dogs should be walked on leashes and kept in fenced yards. Do not let pets wander unsupervised.- Report all animal bites to local city or town animal control officers.- Securely cover all garbage cans so wild animals cannot scavenge for food.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[While the NJ raccoon was killed and tested, the Westerly ""mink"" appears to have got away so there is just the strong suspicion of a rabid exposure. Still, this should be taken seriously. For statistics on animal rabies cases in NJ go to: <http://www.nj.gov/health/cd/rabies_stats.shtml>.
