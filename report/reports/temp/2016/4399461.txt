Wood TV [edited]<http://woodtv.com/2016/08/05/swine-flu-sickens-muskegon-county-fair-exhibitors/>Health officials have connected Michigan's 1st cases of swine flu for 2016 to a sick pig at the Muskegon County Fair.State and county health officials say the 2 confirmed cases of influenza A H3N2 involved swine exhibitors at the fair, which took place last week. A sick pig from the fair also tested positive for the strain at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.Muskegon County's public health department is contacting people who showed swine at the fair to determine whether anyone else became sick. They already alerted area health providers to look out for patients with symptoms of swine flu.People sickened by H3N2v typically suffer the same symptoms as other flu viruses, including fever, cough, runny nose, body aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Swine flu can sometimes lead to more serious health problems, including pneumonia. Children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with medical issues are at higher risk for complications.Symptoms of swine flu surface within 2 to 10 days. There is no vaccine.Swine flu is spread the same way as seasonal flu. In addition, patients should avoid contact with pigs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, swine flu was 1st identified in U.S. pigs in 2010. Most infections have been linked to prolonged exposure to pigs at fairs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These are the 1st human cases of H3N2v reported in 2016; the exposure source is again close contact with pigs as previously reported (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794729>).As these are novel viruses, a single pig-human transmission rarely leads to sustained person-to-person transmission; however, the potential for these H3N2v viruses to acquire the capacity to transmit efficiently remains a serious concern. With minimal preexisting immunity in children and the limited cross-protective effect from seasonal influenza vaccine, the majority of children are susceptible to infection with this novel influenza virus; no appropriate vaccine is available. - Mod.UBA][We should remember that the influenza virus moves in both directions, between humans and swine. As commercial pigs live in large numbers and at high density, they can produce large volumes of virus. On the other hand, they are managed by but a few humans. Thus, outside the fairgrounds, they normally present minimal risk, except losses due to sickness, weight loss, and occasional deaths. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
