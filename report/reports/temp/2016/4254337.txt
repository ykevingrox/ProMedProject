China Quality News [in Chinese, trans. Rappt.DS, edited]<http://www.cqn.com.cn/zj/content/2016-05/29/content_2972616.htm>Recently, Luoyang [Henan province] Inspection & Quarantine Bureau identified a case of falciparum malaria in a worker returning from Angola. This is the 1st time that Luoyang's Port of Entry has found malaria in personnel returning to the country.The worker was in Angola for nearly 2 years. Prior to leaving China, he was not vaccinated for yellow fever. On [25 Apr 2016] he entered China via Beijing Capital Airport. At the time he did not have abnormal health conditions. According to information sent from Beijing to Luoyang Inspection & Quarantine Bureau, specialists were arranged to follow up on this worker's health condition.When it became known that this worker had developed fever, health inspection and quarantine personnel were immediately dispatched, in conjunction with local public health agencies, to the patient's location, carrying out an epidemiological survey, and taking blood and urine samples.Because this patient had high fever and jaundice, and was in critical condition, rapid confirmation of the cause of illness was urgently needed to carry out treatment. Luoyang Inspection & Quarantine Bureau arranged for personnel to work overtime to conduct tests, finally confirming falciparum malaria. Currently, the patient is in hospital receiving treatment and his condition has improved.Since the outbreak of yellow fever in Angola, Luoyang Inspection & Quarantine Bureau has followed the requirement sent by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the PRC and Henan Inspection & Quarantine Bureau, reinforcing disease prevention & control work at Luoyang Airport:- first, investing in updates to body temperature monitoring equipment for several tens of thousands of yuan, increasing the number of inspection staff, and reinforcing the strength of infectious disease inspection and control work at the border;- second, conducting key check-ups and health follow up for personnel returning to China from yellow fever epidemic areas and reporting in timely fashion to local public health agencies;- third, obtaining extra funds for construction of additional airport health inspection laboratories, increasing to 10 the number of infectious diseases for which rapid testing can be done.[Byline: Tu Bin]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver[The case illustrates how easy it is to import infectious diseases between continents. The fact that the person was not immunized against yellow fever should prompt a review of the immunization status of Chinese guest workers in Angola and indeed the rest of Africa.Currently, a yellow fever epidemic is evolving in Angola and the DR Congo spreading into East Africa (Woodall JP, Yuill TM: Why is the yellow fever outbreak in Angola a 'threat to the entire world'? Int J Infect Dis. 2016. pii: S1201-9712(16)31044-X. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2016.05.001. [Epub ahead of print]; <http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(16)31044-X/pdf>). Spread to Asia, which is currently free of yellow fever, is a major concern (Wasserman S, Tambyah PA, Lim PL: Yellow fever cases in Asia: primed for an epidemic. Int J Infect Dis. 2016. pii: S1201-9712(16)31043-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2016.04.025. [Epub ahead of print]; <http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(16)31043-8/pdf>).Luckily, the patient had malaria, which is easy to diagnose and treat (he probably did not take prophylaxis), but the case demonstrates that advanced malaria and yellow fever can not be distinguished by clinical signs and symptoms alone, that laboratory tests are needed. - Mod.EPMaps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6787>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
