IANS New York [edited]<http://www.thestatesman.com/news/science-and-tech/novel-compound-protects-monkeys-from-ebola-virus/127746.html>In an advance towards an effective treatment against the deadly Ebola virus disease, researchers have found that an antiviral compound that blocks the virus's ability to replicate can fully protect monkeys when treated 3 days after infection.The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest that the compound, known as GS-5734, should be further developed as a potential treatment. ""It inhibits Ebola virus by blocking the virus's ability to replicate its own genetic material,"" said study 1st author Travis Warren, principal investigator at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). ""With this process inhibited, the virus can't make copies of itself. Additionally, we saw no evidence from genetic sequence analyses that the virus was able to generate resistance to GS-5734,"" Warren noted.In animal studies, treatment initiated on day 3 post-infection with Ebola virus resulted in 100 percent survival of the monkeys. The animals also exhibited a substantial reduction in viral load and a marked decrease in the physical signs of disease.""GS-5734 has several favourable characteristics for potential treatment of Ebola virus disease in humans. It is made using well controlled chemical synthesis procedures, is stable, and can be made on a large scale,"" said senior author on the study Sina Bavari, science director, USAMRIID. ""It shows substantive post-exposure protection against Ebola virus in non-human primates, even when treatments were started after virus had spread to the blood in some animals,"" Bavari noted.Taken together, the robust therapeutic efficacy observed in primates, the favourable drug-like properties, and the potential for broad-spectrum antiviral activity suggest that further development of GS-5734 for the treatment of Ebola virus and other viral infections is warranted, Bavari said.In cell culture studies, the compound was active against a broad spectrum of viral pathogens. These included Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Marburg virus, and multiple variants of Ebola virus, including the Makona strain causing the most recent outbreak in Western Africa, the researchers said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*******[2] Prevention4 Mar 2016 Nigeria: Knowledge, attitude and perception of Ebola virus disease among secondary school students in Ondo State, Nigeria, October 2014<http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/knowledge-attitude-and-perception-of-ebola-virus-disease-among-secondary-school-students-in-ondo-state-nigeria-october-2014>[An interesting survey.

Leone<http://news.yahoo.com/expelled-pregnant-girls-back-school-leone-220540942.html>[According to the education ministry on Thursday [3 Mar 2016], 5000 girls expelled from Sierra Leone (SL) schools because of pregnancy during the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak have returned to the classroom. As part of government efforts to decrease the spread of EVD, all SL schools were closed from June 2014 to April 2015. When the schools reopened in April 2015, girls were assessed using invasive methods to check whether they were pregnant or had recently given birth. Student ""K,"" in her 3rd year of secondary school in southern SL, told AFP: ""My breasts were lumped together to find out whether they contained milky substances before I was allowed to continue my tuition."" If girls were found to be pregnant, or had become mothers, they were given the choice of attending temporary alternative classes funded by the British and Irish governments. In spite of this, many girls missed entrance exams to gain entrance to a higher secondary school, university or college.]4 Mar 2016 Sierra Leone: 28 Ebola cases linked to single funeral in Sierra Leone in 2014<http://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/online/%7Bb9fd1f84-51a7-419b-bf65-cc646f6008f3%7D/twenty-eight-ebola-cases-linked-to-single-funeral-in-sierra-leone>Citation.

According to Kathryn G. Curran PhD of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, and colleagues reported, instead of using the services of an Ebola burial team, relatives of the pharmacist buried him; 8/28 Ebola patients linked to the funeral later died, all of them males who had touched the corpse. Investigators wrote: ""Immediate, safe, dignified burials by trained teams with appropriate protective equipment are critical to interrupt transmission and control Ebola during times of active community transmission.""][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>.
