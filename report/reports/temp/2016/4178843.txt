Elyoum Elsabie [in Arabic, trans. Mod.MM, edited]<http://bit.ly/1MLcDe4>In a press communique to Elyoum Elsabie newspaper, the director of Preventive Medicine, Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt, has mentioned that the total number of registered brucellosis (Malta fever) cases in humans reached 4065 cases during last year (2015). He also stressed the need for community health education about the practices of drinking raw milk and cheese preparations and related products from unpasteurised milk; in addition to training of animal farm workers and butchers about safe handling of animal products.--communicated by:ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[The number of human brucellosis cases in Egypt during the previous 2 years, as reported to the OIE, were: 2013 - 3766; 2014 - 3951 (no Egyptian data for earlier years available in OIE's WAHID archive). In view of 2015's figures (4065), as given above, a trend of a slight increase seems to be observed in officially reported human brucellosis cases in Egypt. The number of actual cases in humans is considered to be several times higher.Brucellosis is endemic in Egypt's livestock, reported from cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and camels. The prevailing brucella species are _B. melitensis biovar (bv) 3_, _B. abortus bv 1_ and _B. suis bv 1_.

Mod.AB, summ. edited] <http://www.aps.dz/sante-sciences-tech/40490-gharda%C3%AFa-819-cas-de-brucellose-humaine-diagnostiqu%C3%A9s-dsp>Algerie Presse Service [APS] learned on [Sat 16 Apr 2016] from the Services for Prevention and Local Management [DSP] that 819 cases of human brucellosis were diagnosed since the beginning of the year [2016] throughout various localities of the province of Ghardaia. All people affected by this anthropo-zoonosis, also known as Malta fever, were supported by health facilities, and their health is out of danger, according to the head of the DSP, Dr Tahar Semache.The disease is considered a ""rare"" disease in several Mediterranean countries, thus this upsurge in cases of human brucellosis observed in the province of Ghardaia since the beginning of the year represents a matter for concern, said the head of prevention. He added that cases are contracted through contact with livestock, consumption of raw milk or dairy products including ""Kamaria"", a traditional cheese popular in Ghardaia.According to the DSP statistics, the number of registered cases, amounting to 819 up until [April 2016], exceeded the cumulative number recorded during the last 3 years (427 cases in 2015, 277 in 2014 and 116 in 2013).Veterinary services, for their part, confirmed 80 cases of bovine brucellosis circumscribed in 13 clusters in the provinces of Ghardaia, Zelfana, Guerrara, Beriane, and Metlili & El-Menea since the beginning of the year [2016], and indicated that brucellosis detection is going on in bovines, sheep, goats and camels, and those animals found reactive [probably to a serological test not specified] are culled.According to epidemiological investigations launched by Ghardaia veterinary services, this upsurge of human brucellosis is attributed to non-compliance with regulations and lack of hygiene, as well as the refusal of some farmers to vaccinate their livestock, arguing (without proof) that vaccination causes abortion in pregnant females. Also, the frequent use by some breeders of a potentially infected male parent for reproduction is incriminated.The sale of unpasteurized cow, goat and camel milk in plastic bottles intended for mineral water, the lack of control in the marketing of raw milk of dubious origin, and ""kamaria"" cheese sold on public roads all contribute to the resurgence of the disease. Many consumers in Ghardaia province believe firmly in the virtues of natural raw milk, which is considered to be a ""naturally sanitized product"" that they can drink without boiling. Health care practitioners believe that raw milk and derivative products manufactured and sold without labeling are of doubtful safety, calling on consumers to avoid such products. ""It is imperative to boil milk,"" said Dr K Mustapha, explaining that milk from sick animals transmits germs to humans (such as tuberculosis, brucellosis).The ""alarming"" increase of human brucellosis throws light on the absence of strict control of animals and the failure of prophylaxis, including vaccination in livestock, and this causes significant economic losses through direct effects on animals (abortions, infertility, decreased production), say many local veterinarians.Brucellosis constitutes ""a heavy financial burden for hospitals and the economy,"" said acting DSP Bashir Bahaz, warning that the disease may spread wider and further with deficiencies in disease control measures in livestock, hygiene measures, and a lack of regulations on the transportation of livestock and vaccination.--communicated by: ProMED-MENA <promed-mena@promedmail.org>[Ghardaia province is experiencing a real brucellosis epidemic with such a high cumulative number of cases over only 4 months. It seems that cases are addressed and receive proper treatment, but the nature of treatment and possible brucellosis complications are not disclosed. - Mod.AB][Algeria's (fluctuating) earlier statistics of human brucellosis cases, as available on OIE's WAHID interface, are the following:2010 - 84452011 - 44452012 - 52982013 - 41702014 - 6132Another Mediterranean country which has recently been subject to ProMED-mail's coverage is Israel, where _B. melitensis_ is similarly endemic (in contrast to _B. abortus_ (bovis), eradicated there decades ago).In October 2015, one of Israel's 10 leading dairy cattle operations, Revivim (southern Israel), counting more than 2000 animals including about 1300 lactating cows, was found infected by _B. melitensis_ following the reporting of human infection among its personnel (see 20151031.3757610 and subsequent postings). Control measures, including movement restrictions, have been applied and a ""test and slaughter"" policy applied. A secondary infection was discovered in another dairy farm which had purchased calves from Revivim, earlier.So far, more than 200 positive animals have been culled and the test-and-slaughter regime is being continued. Reportedly, a 5th human case has recently been identified among the farm's personnel. Vaccination of calves with brucellosis S19 vaccine, discontinued in Israel 2 years ago, has been recently resumed in the Revivim dairy farm following the analysis of epidemiological data; this includes vaccination of calves above the age limit of 6 months, with a reduced dose. Its application elsewhere is under discussion.The leakage of _B. melitensis_ into dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening of the brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. This should not surprise; in south European and other Mediterranean countries (for example, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Turkey) _B. melitensis_ has been regularly isolated from cattle in contact with infected sheep and goats.The following data on the total annual number of human ""Malta fever"" (cases) have been published by Israel's Ministry of Health: 2005 (141); 2006 (138); 2007 (152); 2008 (149); 2009 (136); 2010 (139); 2011 (127); 2012 (183); 2013 (336); 2014 (596); and 2015 (430).Several new _B. melitensis_ human cases in north Israel, following their consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, have recently been published in the media (<http://www.mynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4784628,00.html>; in Hebrew). In 2 of the patients, osteomyelitis was recorded. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32014>.]
