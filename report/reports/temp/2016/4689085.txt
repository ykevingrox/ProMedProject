Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h7n9-avian-influenza-case-reported-guangdong-china-76692/>The Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong province has reported an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9).The male patient aged 81 from Meizhou is the 1st human case of H7N9 reported in Guangdong this winter [2016-17].From 2013 to date, 778 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported on Mainland China. In addition to the 778 cases reported on the Mainland, 23 cases imported from China have been reported in Canada (2), Hong Kong (16), Malaysia (1), and Taiwan (4).According to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP), avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death.People mainly become infected with avian influenza through close contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings. Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian flu. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.[Byline: Robert Herriman ]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Human cases of influenza A/H7N9 continue to be reported sporadically from China and adjoining regions. Most cases have a documented history of exposure to poultry. As there are few or no signs of apparent infection in poultry, it is difficult to provide concrete advice to individuals handling poultry and therefore surveillance activities need to be continued. - Mod.UBAMaps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11274>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
