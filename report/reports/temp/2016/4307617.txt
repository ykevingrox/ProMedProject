"" ... 2 patients -- diagnosis confirmed. All the people are in stable condition. They are getting medical aid,"" she said.As for the situation in Karaganda region, she said the yards in Yerkindik [Erkindik] village have been fully checked. 62 people had been in contact with the sick people. ""The condition of the 7 hospitalized people is stable, they are getting treatment,"" she said.Commenting on the message about the deceased man in Yerkindik village, he applied for medical aid too late. ""The man came to hospital and said about a cut, there was no information about anthrax. The main problem is late application for medical aid; secondly, the medical organization had no information that the man had cut his hand in the time of butchering. We have sent the inspection there. The actions of the hospital will be checked,"" she said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Kazakhstan can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Kazakhstan> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56>.To find Zharma in east Kazakhstan, go to <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KZ/15/Zharma.html>.Cutaneous anthrax carries a lethality risk of 10 percent without antibiotic treatment. A characteristic of this lesion, before the black ulcer develops, is that the inflamed area is without pain but it itches and has small vesicles; the draining lymph nodes will be inflamed. Though anthrax is not unknown in eastern Kazakhstan -- outbreaks occurred there in 2008 and 2011 -- if the medical team at Zharma had not seen such a lesion before, they will miss the characteristic itching. - Mod.MHJ]
