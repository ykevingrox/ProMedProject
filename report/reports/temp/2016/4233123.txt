Nearly 3/4ths [75 percent] of them did not receive a vaccination against the virus, and an additional 14 percent did not receive the recommended number of doses, according to the health department, which says 2 doses of the vaccine are 98 percent effective.The city sent out an alert to physicians reminding them to make sure children are up to date with their vaccinations.The city in September [2015] urged Orthodox schools and parents to vaccinate their children after a whooping cough outbreak.Some yeshivas have the lowest reported vaccination rates among schools in the city, according to state data.In 2013, the city health department reported 48 cases of measles in the Orthodox Jewish community residing in Borough Park and Williamsburg [neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York City].[Byline: Dan Goldberg]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Vaccines work on the theory of herd immunity, i.e., that disease outbreaks can be prevented if a population has a high proportion of people who are immune to a given disease. Large numbers of people who opt out of vaccination lower a population's level of herd immunity. ""If you have a community where the herd immunity is very, very low and also if there's crowding or very, very large families ... then the disease could spread rapidly,"" C Gill [Associate Professor at Boston University's Center for Global Health & Development and a specialist in infectious diseases and vaccines] said.Since the mid 1990s -- when the vaccine became mandatory for children entering public grade school -- chickenpox rates have predictably plummeted. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccine prevents 3.5 million cases, 9000 hospitalizations, and about 100 deaths caused by the illness every year. And despite the ongoing ruckus made by anti-vaccination activists, 90 percent of children from the ages of 19 to 35 months have gotten their 1st dose of the vaccine as of 2010. The 2nd dose is recommended at 4 to 6 years old.Whether a similar anti-vaccination sentiment explains the current outbreak is difficult to say, however. Prominent rabbis within more restrictive sects of the Orthodox community have spoken out against vaccination, and a Brooklyn measles outbreak in 2013 centered around 2 Orthodox Jewish communities in the neighborhoods of Borough Park and Williamsburg.But other voices in the community have loudly rebuffed these vaccine skeptics, and there's seemingly no Jewish law that discourages vaccination. In 2013, a representative from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told Jewish publication Forward that 96 percent of Brooklyn students who attended yeshivas, the traditional form of education for Orthodox children, had received their necessary shots. More likely than not, then, the outbreak is the result of an isolated pocket of resistance.Because chickenpox is highly contagious, though, health officials are advising medical providers throughout the city to stay on high alert. And to make sure that their patients and staff are fully up to date on their own shots. While the chickenpox vaccine isn't foolproof, 2 doses are about 90 percent effective at preventing the disease. People suspected of contracting chickenpox but who haven't yet shown any symptoms can also be given the vaccine up to 3 days after they were 1st exposed.(From <http://www.rawstory.com/2016/05/chickenpox-outbreak-hits-nyc-orthodox-jewish-community-mostly-in-unvaccinated-kids/>)A map of Williamsburg, New York can be accessed at <http://www.aaccessmaps.com/images/maps/us/ny/brooklyn_n/brooklyn_n.gif>.

The warm temperature that we see these days helps in activating viruses and bacteria that attack people, especially with low immunity,"" says Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, department of medicine, Moolchand Hospital.People at high risk are those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, blood pressure, cancer, chronic kidney ailment, HIV or tuberculosis and people on steroids or other immunity-suppressing medicines.Normally, red-coloured rashes appear within 24 hours of a person getting fever, up to 102 Fahrenheit, which turn into fluid-filled blisters, before finally crusting over. The blisters are itchy and take about 10 days to crust over. A person develops relative immunity toward chickenpox for life.""The virus lies dormant. There may be a local infection at some point that makes skin to flare up, but the disease per se happens only once in a life time,"" said a doctor from the paediatrics department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The chickenpox virus Varicella-zoster uses droplets in the air to travel. If a person with the infection coughs or sneezes near a healthy person, he or she might contract it.A person may also contract the infection if exposed to the fluid from the eruptions.Chickenpox is a common childhood disease. But when people catch the disease for the 1st time as adults, the symptoms tend to be severe.Earlier there was no specific treatment for chickenpox, but these days certain anti-viral drugs are available that minimise its magnitude significantly. The disease is mostly treated at the symptomatic level, to reduce severe itchiness and to bring down fever.Due to its highly contagious nature, doctors advise people to stay away from those who have developed rashes on skin, usually within 24 hours of getting fever.The vaccine Varicella costs about Rs 1500 [about USD 22] and is the widely used protection against chickenpox. However, due to its high cost, doctors feel it is not feasible for everyone to use it. ""It's not part of the national immunisation programme purely because of its high cost and also the disease normally is not of very serious nature. The vaccine is good for those who can afford it, otherwise it should be given mainly to high-risk people,"" said Dr Sharma.According to the doctors, it takes about 2-3 days to develop immunity against the disease, hence, it is important to take the vaccine shot immediately after a near one has developed symptoms.Symptoms of chickenpox----------------------- A rash that usually begins on the body and face and later often spreads to the scalp and limbs- The rash is often itchy- It begins as small red spots which develop into blisters in a couple of hours- After a couple of days, the blisters turn into scabs- New blisters may appear after 3-6 days- High grade fever- Severe head and body ache- Loss of appetite- Children have mild symptoms- In children, the symptoms last 7-10 days, and longer in adults.- Adults get severe symptoms and take longer to recover. They are also more likely than children to suffer from complications.[Byline: Rhythma Kaul]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, India can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/330>. - Mod.LK]
