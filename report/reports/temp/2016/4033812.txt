Angola Press Agency (Angop) [in Spanish, trans.

These data were presented in a meeting between health technicians and the Huila vice governor for the political and social sector, Maria Joao Chipalavela, to evaluate the proposed contingency plan for control of the disease.Telma Diogo indicated that the Caluquembe municipality with 10 cases and 4 deaths was the 1st to report the outbreak, an similar case number as in Lubango, which has 2 deaths, followed by Caconda with 11 cases and one death, Quipungo with 5 reported cases and one death (in this municipality, the [affected] families refused to hospitalize their patients due to traditional practices).Telma Diogo also confirmed that one case had been registered in each of these localities: Humpata, Gambos, Chicomba (the patient fled), Matala, and Quilengues, where the patients came [to?] the capital of the country in an advanced stage of the disease. ""Although the 1st cases appeared in Caluquembe, we can state that the entire province is at risk of [yellow fever] occurrence, as much for movement in as for individuals who live here seeking care"", said the official.Telma Diogo lamented, however, the absconding of some patients from hospital units in order to receive traditional treatment, a situation that causes the health technical personnel and other entities such as traditional and religious people to call attention to the danger that this represents in the heart of the communities. According to what she said, 22 patients with the disease are currently hospitalized in hospital units in the province.Huila province has an estimated population of more than 2 354 398, inhabitants according to data provided by the 2014 census.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A 15 Feb 2015 report indicated that of the 1 500 000 expected to be vaccinated in the Luanda area, about 60 per cent have received the vaccine (<http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/es_es/noticias/saude/2016/1/7/Campana-combate-fiebre-amarilla-Viana-con-balance-positivo,21a4c0ea-e97a-4ce1-ba20-66bd199ca467.html> in Spanish). An additional 15 Feb 2016 report stated that, ""theminister of health, Jose Van-dunem, stated on [Sun 14 Feb 2016] that due to an insufficient quantity of vaccine, priority will be given to children and to those individuals not previously vaccinated, without neglecting that in cases of epidemics, all the people must be immunized (<http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/es_es/noticias/saude/2016/1/7/Escasez-vacuna-exige-racionalizacion-campana,ee21b25a-db33-4e40-9c5e-3450401fde6b.html> in Spanish).A shortage of yellow fever (YF) vaccine in the face of an ongoing outbreak is worrisome. One hopes that fresh vaccine supplies will arrive very soon. Curiously, there appears to be no vaccination campaign going on in Huila province yet, and contingency plans are just now being drawn up. In a yellow fever outbreak, time is he enemy.ProMED-mail subscriber Stephen J Seligman, MD (adjunct professor, Casanova Lab, St Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> ) commented, ""specimens suitable for virus isolation should be sent to the African reference laboratories for yellow fever (enabling the sequencing of the virus to distinguish between a case of yellow fever from viscerotropic disease [YEL-AVD]) and the freezing of specimens to enable sequencing of the patient's DNA (facilitating the determination of genetic defects predisposing to YEL-AVD). In a report of 38 million vaccinees in Africa in which highly competent investigators were involved, in no instances were such specimens obtainable. The task is not trivial.""Viscerotropic YF from vaccination has been estimated to occur in one of one million vaccinees, a health risk far lower than that of wild YF cases. A YF virus repository would be desirable not only to distinguish between YEL-AVD wild YF virus but also to provide virus isolates collected in different outbreaks, over time, for genomic analysis that would be of epidemiological value.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32978>. - Mod.TY]
