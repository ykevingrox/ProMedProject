HIVISASA [edited]<http://www.hivisasa.com/garissa/health/156680>Even as the tuberculosis [TB] survey promises a different picture ailment, current data shows that Nairobi, Garissa, and Mombasa counties have the highest cases of drug-resistant TB.According to the statistics from the National Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Lung Disease [NTLD] Programme, Nairobi leads in the drug resistant strain of TB with 74 cases, Garissa with 69 cases and Mombasa closing the top 3 affected counties with 17 cases of the disease that takes at least 6 months to treat. [Duration of therapy for isoniazid (INH)/rifampin-susceptible TB is 6 -9 months; duration of therapy for MDR [multidrug-resistant] TB is 18-24 months (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab16>).Acknowledging the just released data, NTLD head, Masini Enos, said there is a general improvement as far as the ailment is contained. The counties that recorded the highest improvement are Isiolo and Kisumu counties.Tuberculosis, a bacterial airborne disease, is presently ranked as Kenya's 5th killer ailment, having claimed about 10,183 lives since 2015.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Of all the countries that report their tuberculosis (TB) statistics to WHO, there are 20 countries with the highest burden in terms of absolute number of cases plus another 10 countries with the most severe burden in terms of case rates per capita; these countries are referred to as the TB ""high burden"" countries (HBC) (<http://www.tbfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/high_tb_burdencountrylists2016-2020-1.pdf>). There are 3 HBC lists, one for TB, one for TB/HIV coinfection and one for multidrug resistant TB (MDR TB). Each list accounts for 85-89 percent of the global burden.Kenya is among HBC countries in all 3 lists. In 2014, Kenya reported a TB prevalence of 120 000 cases and a TB incidence of 110 000 cases. Kenya's TB incidence rate was 245.5 per 100 000 persons. For comparison, the US reported a TB incidence of 9421 TB cases in 2014 with a TB incidence rate of 2.96 cases per 100 000 persons.The GeneXpert MTB/RIF is an integrated, automated, closed system, which enables rapid detection of DNA sequences present in sputum samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, as well as mutations in a gene that confer resistance to rifampin. Rifampin resistance is used as a surrogate marker for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Testing is completed within 2 hours, with minimal biohazard and performed by low-skilled workers who have very little technical training required to operate the equipment (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0907847>). A 4-module GeneXpert can process 16-20 specimens per 8-hour working day (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740172/>). Because the equipment is expensive, and requires regular maintenance, uninterrupted electrical line power, plus a temperature-controlled operating environment, it is unsuitable for more remote settings.In May 2016, Kenya reported that there were at the time 70 GeneXpert machines installed and were to start using GeneXpert as first test in facilities where it is available (<http://nltp.co.ke/genexpert/>). The presence of the GeneXpert system in Kenya will likely increase the number of cases of TB and MDR TB detected, and its reduced turnaround time for TB diagnosis and rifampin resistance, will reduce the time that untreated or inappropriately treated patients can continue to spread TB in the community.Kenya, with a population of about 45 million residents, is a country in East Africa that is bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, South Sudan and Ethiopia to the north, and Somalia and the Indian Ocean to the east (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya>). Kenya is divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties: Nairobi County, in south central Kenya, with a population of about 3.4 million residents, includes the city of Nairobi, Kenya's capital and largest city; Mombasa County, with a population of 1.2 million residents, is on the Indian Ocean coast; its capital is the city of Mombasa; Garissa County with a population of about 623 000 borders Somalia; its capital is Garissa.
