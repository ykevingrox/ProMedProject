World Health Organization, OPGA/WHO/FAO/OIE joint news release [edited]<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/commitment-antimicrobial-resistance/en/>World leaders today [21 Sep 2016] signalled an unprecedented level of attention to curb the spread of infections that are resistant to antimicrobial medicines.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) happens when bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi develop resistance against medicines that were previously able to cure them.For the 1st time, Heads of State committed to taking a broad, coordinated approach to address the root causes of AMR across multiple sectors, especially human health, animal health and agriculture. This is only the 4th time a health issue has been taken up by the UN General Assembly (the others were HIV, noncommunicable diseases, and Ebola). The high-level meeting was convened by the President of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, H.E. Peter Thomson.""Antimicrobial resistance threatens the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and requires a global response,"" Mr Thomson said. ""Member States have today agreed upon a strong political declaration that provides a good basis for the international community to move forward. No one country, sector or organization can address this issue alone.""Countries reaffirmed their commitment to develop national action plans on AMR, based on the ""Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance"" -- the blueprint for tackling AMR developed in 2015 by WHO in coordination with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) [available at: <http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/drug_resistance/resources/global_action_plan_eng.pdf>]. Such plans are needed to understand the full scale of the problem and stop the misuse of antimicrobial medicines in human health, animal health and agriculture. Leaders recognized the need for stronger systems to monitor drug-resistant infections and the volume of antimicrobials used in humans, animals, and crops, as well as increased international cooperation and funding.They pledged to strengthen regulation of antimicrobials, improve knowledge and awareness, and promote best practices -- as well as to foster innovative approaches using alternatives to antimicrobials and new technologies for diagnosis and vaccines.""Antimicrobial resistance poses a fundamental threat to human health, development, and security. The commitments made today must now be translated into swift, effective, lifesaving actions across the human, animal, and environmental health sectors. We are running out of time,"" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO.Common and life-threatening infections like pneumonia, gonorrhoea, and post-operative infections, as well as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are increasingly becoming untreatable because of AMR. Left unchecked, AMR is predicted to have significant social, health security, and economic repercussions that will seriously undermine the development of countries.The high levels of AMR already seen in the world today are the result of overuse and misuse of antibiotics and other antimicrobials in humans, animals (including farmed fish), and crops, as well as the spread of residues of these medicines in soil, crops, and water. Within the broader context of AMR, resistance to antibiotics is considered the greatest and most urgent global risk requiring international and national attention.""AMR is a problem not just in our hospitals, but on our farms and in our food, too. Agriculture must shoulder its share of responsibility, both by using antimicrobials more responsibly and by cutting down on the need to use them, through good farm hygiene,"" said Dr JosÌ© Graziano da Silva, Director-General of FAO.""Effective and accessible antibiotics are as vital for protecting animal health and welfare and good veterinary medicine as they are for human health. We urge national authorities to strongly support all sectors involved, through promotion of responsible and prudent use, good practices and implementation of established standards and guidelines,"" said Dr Monique Eloit, Director-General of OIE.Leaders at the UN meeting called on WHO, FAO and OIE, in collaboration with development banks such the World Bank and other relevant stakeholders, to coordinate their planning and actions and to report back to the UN General Assembly in September 2018.Countries called for better use of existing, cost-effective tools for preventing infections in humans and animals. These include immunization, safe water and sanitation, good hygiene in hospitals, and animal husbandry. Putting in place systems to ensure more appropriate use of existing and new antibiotics is also essential.In addition, they highlighted market failures, and called for new incentives for investment in research and development of new, effective and affordable medicines, rapid diagnostic tests, and other important therapies to replace those that are losing their power.They stressed that affordability and access to existing and new antibiotics, vaccines and other medical tools should be a global priority and should take into account the needs of all countries.For more information, please contact:Tomas PicoOffice of the President of the UN General AssemblyNew York<picot@un.org>Sarah RussellWorld Health Organization<russellsa@who.int>Sudeshna ChowdhuryFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations<sudeshna.chowdhury@fao.org>Catherine Bertrand-FerrandisWorld Organisation for Animal Health<c.bertrand-ferrandis@oie.int>Olivia Lawe-DaviesWorld Health OrganizationGeneva/Rome<lawedavieso@who.int>Christopher EmsdenFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations<christopher.emsden@fao.org>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The ""Overview"" of the WHO ""Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance"" is extracted below:""At the 68th World Health Assembly in May 2015, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance, including antibiotic resistance, the most urgent drug resistance trend.""Antimicrobial resistance is occurring everywhere in the world, compromising our ability to treat infectious diseases, as well as undermining many other advances in health and medicine. The goal of the draft global action plan is to ensure, for as long as possible, continuity of successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with effective and safe medicines that are quality-assured, used in a responsible way, and accessible to all who need them.""To achieve this goal, the global action plan sets out 5 strategic objectives:- to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;- to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research;- to reduce the incidence of infection;- to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents; and- [to] develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.""""Objective 1: Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training (<http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/awareness/en/>)""Raising awareness of antimicrobial resistance and promoting behavioural change through public communication programmes that target different audiences in human health, animal health and agricultural practice as well as consumers is critical to tackling this issue. Including the use of antimicrobial agents and resistance in school curricula will also promote a better understanding and awareness from an early age.""Making antimicrobial resistance a core component of professional education, training, certification, continuing education and development in the health and veterinary sectors and agricultural practice will help to ensure proper understanding and awareness among professionals.""""Objective 2: Strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research (<http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/surveillance/en/>)""To better understand and respond to antimicrobial resistance patterns and key drivers, information about antimicrobial resistance incidence, prevalence, and trends must be gathered.""There are significant gaps in the information available on the development and global economic implications of antimicrobial resistance. Stronger networks of information sharing and a global strategic research agenda would improve global understanding of antimicrobial resistance.""National governments, intergovernmental organizations, agencies, professional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, industry and academic should pursue research on the causes and impacts of antimicrobial resistances. A global emphasis on surveillance and evidence based research will inform policies and actions that Member States and intergovernmental agencies can take to address the growing health security challenges of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, increased information about antimicrobial resistance can assist research and development of medical and agriculture alternatives to antimicrobials.""""Objective 3: Reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures (<http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/infection-prevention-control/en/>)""Stronger hygiene and infection prevention measures, including vaccination, can limit the spread of resistant microorganisms and reduce antimicrobial misuse and overuse.""Infection prevention measures such as sanitation, hand washing, food and water safety, and vaccination can decrease the spread of microorganisms resistant to antimicrobial medicines. By preventing infectious diseases whose treatment would require antimicrobial medicines and viral infections which are frequently mistreated with antimicrobial medicines, the global community can better steward these essential medicines.""Sustainable antimicrobial use extends beyond human well-being to animal production. Antibiotics are frequently used to stimulate growth and prevent infections in farms and slaughterhouses. Sustainable animal husbandry practices can reduce the risk of resistant bacteria spreading through the food chain to humans.""""Objective 4: Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health (<http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/optimise-use/en/>)""To increase the longevity of antimicrobials, clinical, pharmacy, and veterinary practices must eliminate unnecessary dispensing.""Evidence based prescribing through effective, rapid, low-cost diagnostic tools are needed to optimize use of antimicrobials for humans and animals. In addition to better prescribing practices, the global community must adjust patients' and the agricultural industry's inappropriate and unregulated use of antimicrobial agents.""Stronger compliance to antibiotic treatment regimes, quality assurance measures to prevent consumption of substandard medications, and restrictions of non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics within agriculture will provide a foundation for antimicrobial stewardship. Regulations for antibiotic distribution, quality, and use could preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics as a public good.""""Objective 5: Develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions (<http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/research-development/en/>)""Research and development of new antimicrobial medicines, diagnostic tools, and vaccines must be reinvigorated.""The global community must encourage sustainable investments in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines, and alternative interventions. The majority of pharmaceutical companies are no longer researching a new antibiotic which is a global concern for human and animal health. Research and development is needed to produce new treatments that can be deployed against multi-drug resistant infections.""To stimulate the development and production of affordable, equitable access to new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines, and alternatives, these medications may need to be de-linked from price and sales volume."" - Mod.ML]
