One pertinent example is the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of Ebola during the West African Ebola outbreak. Zachariah and Harries (1) write: ""...the specificity of the WHO case definition was strikingly low at 31åá5 percent (95 percent CI 26åá0-37åá6). This implies that 68 percent of patients who would be selected for admission to a holding unit would not actually have Ebola virus disease (false-positive results); indeed, a toss of a coin might have yielded a better chance of an accurate result.""The criteria for establishing disease causality are well established. Lujo virus [LUJV] has definitely been shown to be the cause of Lujo hemorrhagic fever. LUJV has been grown in culture and causes a hemorrhagic fever in guinea pigs and non-human primates (2-4). In contrast, the WHO investigation of the illnesses that occurred in the Bas-Congo district [now Kongo Central] of DR Congo concluded that the 5 cases who died among the 13 cases investigated did not die of a hemorrhagic fever (5, 6). Sequences of Bas-Congo virus [BASV] were isolated from only one of these cases, a nurse whose disease responded rapidly to antibiotic treatment (7). BASV has not yet been reported to have been isolated or grown in culture, nor has it been shown to cause any disease in an animal. BASV is a tibrovirus of the family Rhaboviridae. Tibroviruses have been reported to make harmless incursions into humans (8) and cattle (9). We dispute the claims that BASV is a deadly virus that causes a hemorrhagic fever (10). This has not been established by virology community standards.[References]1. R. Zachariah, A. D.
