Four states have reported more than 100 cases this year: IA, IN, IL and MA.Although mumps cases have seen a sharp decline since the CDC began recommending a 2-dose vaccine prevention plan in 1988, outbreaks are still prevalent, particularly in high-contact social settings like college campuses. Mumps is transmittable through the air or by touching unwashed, contaminated surfaces, and the rising cases bring into question vaccination practices, waning immunity, and college healthcare.Concerns unique to colleges---------------------------Mumps outbreaks can be difficult to detect at 1st because doctors are not always thinking about the disease, said Susan Even, MD, executive director of the University of Missouri Student Health Center and chair of the American College Health Association (ACHA)'s Vaccine Preventable Disease Advisory Committee. ...One dose of the MMR vaccine affords 78 per cent protection, while 2 doses provide 88 per cent effectiveness, according to the CDC. The vaccine is the best prevention for mumps, and Even encourages colleges to ask for proof that their students are immunized and not just assume they are.The disease is contagious at least 5 days before symptoms appear, and not all students experience or report symptoms.[Excerpted from <http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/04/early-reports-show-mumps-rise-2016-including-campuses>]A map of Nebraska, USA, may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229>. - Mod.LK]******[2] USA (Michigan)Date: Thu 30 Jun 2016 Source: WTVB [edited]<http://wtvbam.com/news/articles/2016/jun/30/health-agency-warns-of-mumps-exposure/>Health agency warns of mumps exposure-------------------------------------The Branch-Hillsdale-St. Joseph Community Health Agency is asking health care providers to be on alert for potential exposures to mumps, particularly in Hillsdale County [Michigan].
