SBS News, AAP (Australian Associated Press) report [edited]<http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/05/13/sa-confirms-11-cases-meningococcal>South Australia [SA] Health says 11 meningococcal cases have been confirmed so far this year [2016], an unusually high number.Health Minister Jack Snelling says the patients are aged between 1 and 94 years and that 4 of those cases have developed over the past 2 weeks.SA Health chief medical officer Paddy Phillips says it compares with 7 meningococcal cases this time last year [2015] and a total of 30 throughout 2015.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[South Australia (SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. Its population of 1.7 million people is the most highly concentrated, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs; other population centers in the state are relatively small (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia>).We are not told in the news report above any of the characteristics of the 11 cases. For example, are the cases sporadic or part of an outbreak? If it is an outbreak, is it community- or organization-based? What are the ages of the cases, ethnic group, or sexual orientation? How many of the cases are primary (i.e., no known close contact with another patient with meningococcal disease) and how many are secondary (i.e., close contacts of another patient with meningococcal disease)? What are the serogroups of the meningococcal isolates? If they are the same serogroup, have the isolates been genotyped? ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/286>.]
