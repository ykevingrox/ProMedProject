EpiCore Surveillance Project [edited]As reported by the Ministry of Health in the media, we are currently experiencing an outbreak of undiagnosed illness in 2 nearby districts of Dodoma Region. The 1st 2 cases were twin boys, 11 years old, who presented with history of vomiting, diarrhoea, deep jaundice, and massive ascites; they were admitted at Dodoma Regional Referral Hospital on [5 Jun 2016] and they both died within 48 hours after progressing very fast to fulminant liver failure.A day after the deaths [9 Jun 2016], 5 other patients from the same family were admitted with the same symptoms and one of them, a 21-year-old male, died on the same day after presenting with symptoms of fulminant liver failure as well. [None of the patients reported a history of fever], and the monitoring in the hospital did not record a rise of temperature [in any of them]. The index family had a history of eating uninspected meat, however more than 8 families ate the same meat and did not report any symptoms.A few days later, patients with similar symptoms and deaths were reported to appear from nearby villages, who didn't consume the meat and were unrelated to the index family.As of today, 22 Jun 2016, a total of 28 patients have been reported, with 7 deaths. 21 patients are still in observation and most of them are improving with symptomatic management.Comment-------With the observation of these cases, they all have the same presentation mainly abdominal discomfort followed by vomiting, diarrhoea (sometimes blood stained), jaundice, and progressive abdominal distension due to ascites, with no fever. It has been observed that patients are affected in family clusters, since the index family had 9 patients, others with 4, 3, or 2 family members presenting with the same symptoms, which can point to sharing a certain kind of the same exposure.So far there is no definitive diagnosis, however there is evidence of acute hepatocellular injury (probably due to hepatotoxins), with documented elevation of liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and low total protein, with normal renal function tests (serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), and normal haemogram in all patients.Preliminary results have ruled out viral hepatitis E while still working on hepatitis A, haemorrhagic fevers (yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, etc.) and enteric infections; however further analyses are ongoing.A multidisciplinary team is working on all the other possibilities, including finding common exposures for toxicological tests, meanwhile testing for aflatoxins [please see Mod.TG's comment in the original post].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As more laboratory investigation results become available, the disease pathology may become clearer.One thing is apparent: there is evidence of severe liver disease in an acute presentation. A common source for the distributed cases must be identified based on epidemiological investigation, so that preventive/control measures may be instituted as soon as possible. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9564>.]
