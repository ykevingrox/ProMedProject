6ABC WATE, WIAT report [edited]<http://wate.com/2016/05/14/swimming-in-alabama-lakes-connected-to-sores-outbreak-in-children/>Dozens of parents have been sounding off on social media after their kids started breaking out in sores after swimming in the lake. Lewis Smith Lake [in north Alabama] is now another body of water where parents said their kids are catching ""staph [staphylococcal] infection."" What started off as a sore nose ended in sores all over 4-year-old's body after swimming in Smith Lake. ""It just started oozing like goo and stuff and it just looked really red and nasty and then sores started popping up all over his body,"" his mother said.This complaint about Smith Lake comes just after people were complaining about painful sores after swimming in Lake Logan Martin [in east central Alabama]. Dr Darrel Dawkins says staph infection is pretty well contained, but the younger the child, the higher the risk. ""The younger the child, the more potential you can have problems and when we get into the blood stream that is when we get into a critical situation,"" said Dawkins. [The 4-year-old's] infection didn't enter his blood stream, but he did have sores everywhere. His pediatrician linked his staph outbreak to Smith Lake.""She confirmed that it was impetigo that he got swimming in the lake. I'm not putting my kids back in the lake,"" said [the 4-year-old's mother].The Alabama Department of Environmental Management said that they only test Smith Lake for _Escherichia coli_, and that goes for all the other lakes in Alabama as well. With the recent fluctuation in weather, there is a strong possibility that lakes can back up with waste, which in turn breeds bacteria.""It would be nice if they put warnings out there and warned people. Whatever he touched we had to clean it to make sure no one else got it because it was very contagious,"" [the 4-year-old's mother] said. The risk you run swimming in a lake gives ""swim at your own risk"" a whole new meaning. According to Dawkins, who has treated a few kids for staph this summer, the healing process can be lengthy and painful. ""The thing that we have to do then is relieve the pressure and size it, cut it with a needle and drain it and sometimes we have to leave something in there to keep it open so that it will continue to drain,"" Dawkins said. Dawkins suggests Clorox baths for kids that have had this infection more than once, and also to not swim in any of these lakes if you have an open sore.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report above says that swimming in an Alabama lake caused impetigo and what may be boils. Impetigo is a common, highly contagious, very superficial skin infection caused by either _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (also called group A streptococci or GAS). Impetigo mainly affects infants and children and usually appears as red sores on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, which can spread over the rest of the body. The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts. Boils (also called furuncles) that occur under the skin are red, swollen, painful and warm to the touch; they later fill with pus. Most boils are caused by _S. aureus_.GAS and _S. aureus_ are not commonly found in water and it is unlikely that infections due to these organisms were acquired from exposure to contaminated lake water. The CDC reports that no illnesses due to these organisms were among those infections acquired from recreational water, which includes lakes (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6424a4.htm?s_cid=mm6424a4_w#Tab>).However, GAS and _S. aureus_ infections can be spread at recreational water facilities. Most likely impetigo and boils were acquired by direct and indirect contact with infected persons. Direct contact happens by touching another person's infection. Indirect contact happens when contaminated items (like towels) are shared or contaminated surfaces are touched (like hand rails or locker room benches).Lewis Smith Lake is a reservoir in north Alabama that was created with the construction of the Lewis Smith Dam, one of the largest earthen dams in the eastern United States; the lake covers over 21 000 acres [about 8500 ha] in Cullman, Walker, and Winston counties (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Smith_Lake>).The state of Alabama can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53239>.
