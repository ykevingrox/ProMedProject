WHO Media centre [edited]<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/emergency-committee-zika-microcephaly/en>WHO Director-General summarizes the outcome of the Emergency Committee on Zika----------------------------------------------------------------------WHO statement on the 1st meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee on Zika virus and observed increase in neurological disorders and neonatal malformations I convened an Emergency Committee, under the International Health Regulations, to gather advice on the severity of the health threat associated with the continuing spread of Zika virus disease in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Committee met today by teleconference.In assessing the level of threat, the 18 experts and advisers looked in particular at the strong association, in time and place, between infection with the Zika virus and a rise in detected cases of congenital malformations and neurological complications.The experts agreed that a causal relationship between Zika infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is strongly suspected, though not yet scientifically proven. All agreed on the urgent need to coordinate international efforts to investigate and understand this relationship better.The experts also considered patterns of recent spread and the broad geographical distribution of mosquito species that can transmit the virus.The lack of vaccines and rapid and reliable diagnostic tests, and the absence of population immunity in newly affected countries were cited as further causes for concern.After a review of the evidence, the Committee advised that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes an ""extraordinary event"" and a public health threat to other parts of the world.In their view, a coordinated international response is needed to minimize the threat in affected countries and reduce the risk of further international spread.Members of the Committee agreed that the situation meets the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.I have accepted this advice.Public Health Emergency of International Concern.-------------------------------------------------I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.A coordinated international response is needed to improve surveillance, the detection of infections, congenital malformations, and neurological complications, to intensify the control of mosquito populations, and to expedite the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines to protect people at risk, especially during pregnancy.The Committee found no public health justification for restrictions on travel or trade to prevent the spread of Zika virus.At present, the most important protective measures are the control of mosquito populations and the prevention of mosquito bites in at-risk individuals, especially pregnant women.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is very bad news for Brazil, likely to reduce the number of foreign visitors arriving for Carnival and the Rio Olympics, and the attendance of some female athletes, and further damage Brazil`s already rocky economy. It is also a cause of great anxiety to women that are pregnant, or hoping to be pregnant, in the next 2 years, which is the time that some countries are advising their women of fertile age to abstain from having children. At least 36 people have returned from infected countries to the USA after having been infected with Zika virus, and many others to Europe, while 24 countries in the Americas are already infected, the latest being Jamaica & Peru.There are calls for governments to do more in the area of mosquito control, in which they have spectacularly failed over decades, because of failure of the public to support clean-up programs for reducing mosquito breeding sites on their own property. Mosquito control cannot succeed without the whole-hearted co-operation of the whole community.- Mod JWA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8854>.]
