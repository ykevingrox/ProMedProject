In Africa, meningitis causes each year sporadic cases in many countries and outbreaks in countries along the meningitis belt in West and Central Africa. In 2012, _Neisseria meningitidis_ was the cause of the epidemic with a predominant serogroup NmW135 in Cote d'Ivoire. In 2016 _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was confirmed to be the main agent of the meningitis epidemic in Ghana. This article aims to bring forward the features of the circulating serotypes of this epidemic that caused 50% mortality in order to contribute to the therapeutic and immunization response to the serotypes components of vaccines.A total of 66 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected from the National Reference Center of Meningitis in Pasteur Institute of Cote d'Ivoire, which were coming from areas affected by the epidemic germs. The identification of the germs was made through conventional bacteriology and by the PCR method. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) [was determined for] penicillin G and ceftriaxone. The _S. pneumoniae_ serotypes [were determined] by region based on differences in the [capsular] polyssacharides. The molecular serotyping of pneumococci was done according to the Rekha et al, 2006 Protocol. Out of the 66 CSF collected from the patients suspected to have meningitis, 28 were positive with a rate of 42.4%: 71.4% (20/28) [were positive for] _S. pneumoniae_, 17.8% (5/28) [for] _N. meningitidis_ and 7.1% (2/28) _H. influenzae_ b.The MIC [for an isolate of _S. pneumoniae_] was 0.015 to penicillin G and 0.06 mg/L for the ceftriaxone. The strains were very sensitive, allowing treatment according to the national protocol.Serotyping (PCR) of _S. pneumoniae_ shows a distribution of 50% (10/20) for serotype 1, 5% (1/20) for serotype 12 and 5% (1/20) for the serotype 5.These results confirm the predominance of serotype 1 _S. pneumoniae_ in Cote d'Ivoire. This is a polyclonal epidemic. The [molecular?] sequencing will clarify the characteristics of the serotype 1 strains.--Dr. Clarisse Kouame Elogne AttachÌ© de recherche Unite de Bacteriologie Clinique Responsable qualitÌ© et biosÌ©curitÌ© Institut Pasteur de CICote d'Ivoire<nzolecla@yahoo.fr>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Clarisse Kouame Elogne for submission of data on the etiology of bacterial meningitis in Cote d'Ivoire, a country in the African meningitis belt.The usual pathogen in this region has been _Neisseria meningitidis_. However, several other bacterial species, including _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Hemophilus pneumoniae_, have noted to be involved in bacterial meningitis outbreaks in the African meningitis belt before (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1699486>). Some studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season, especially in older children and young adults (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha> and <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>). _S. pneumoniae_ serotype 1 from a single clonal complex (ST 217) has predominated in several outbreaks, but other pneumococcal serotypes are also isolated. The case-fatality rate for pneumococcal meningitis has been high; over 40 percent of cases are fatal, regardless of age group.Identifying the specific microbial causes of a bacterial meningitis outbreak is critically important, because prior meningococcal immunization programs with a particular serogroup vaccine in the region may have resulted in replacement of a previous serogroup with other meningococcal serogroups or the outbreak may actually be due to non-meningococcal bacterial species.Use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine could be beneficial in an outbreak where pneumococcal etiology predominates. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce carriage of serotypes of _S. pneumoniae_ contained in the vaccine and thus person-to-person transmission of these pathogens, which occurs by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. However, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was found to include serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) protective against only 8 percent of the isolates in one study in Burkina Faso (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.full>). The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar 13, which covers serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, may be more effective, especially when serotype 1 predominates. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52>.][See Also:Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: (Kebbi) fatal, sg C 20160221.4037676Meningitis, pneumococcal - Ghana (02): (BA) fatal, RFI 20160120.3950154Meningitis, pneumococcal - Ghana: (BA) fatal 20160107.39162852015---- Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (05): serogroup C, fatal, vaccine shortage 20150802.3552463Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (04): serogroup C, fatal, WHO, update 20150724.3533998Meningitis - Sudan (Khartoum) RFI 20150531.3398711Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (03): serogroup C, fatal, WHO, update 20150517.3368315Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (02): fatal, update 20150506.3344024Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger: fatal, serogroups C, W 20150430.3332448Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria (02): serogroup C, MSF, 2013-2014, follow-up 20150325.3252914Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: serogroup C, WHO 20150317.32361962014---- Meningitis, meningococcal - Ethiopia (02): RFI 20140816.2695255Meningitis, meningococcal - Ghana: susp, fatal, RFI 20140318.2339213Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (PA) fatal, college, sg.
