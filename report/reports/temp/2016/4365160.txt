Le Progres [in French, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.leprogres.fr/loire/2016/07/14/incomprehension-chez-le-fromager>The Puillet cheese factory, located in Roanne [Loire Department, France], withdrew its products from sale after detection of _Listeria monocytogenes_, a bacterium causing listeriosis. 2 people from the retirement home of Belmont-de-la-Loire have been infected._Listeria_ bacterium has been detected in Camembert cheese made from cow's milk from a local dairy.The presence of bacteria was detected after 2 people from the retirement home of Belmont-de-la-Loire, returned after a festive meal on 23 Jun [2106]. The investigation by the DDPP Loire (Department for Protection of Populations) revealed that the infection had come from cheese consumed during the meal. The 2 seniors are on antibiotic treatment and were supported by the ARS (Regional Health Agency).Cheese had been made from raw cow's milk and mixed cow and goat milk under the name of ""Camembel"" from the cheese maker Puillet. The cheese has been recalled and production had been stopped. Cleaning and disinfection of the entire manufacturing process is underway. Different surface sampling and monitoring products have yet to be analyzed. The establishment will resume production when the safety will be assured and validated by the DDPP. ""The controls are very strict, since consumer safety is at stake,"" said Patrick Rubi, deputy director of the DDPP.The manager of the dairy remains dubious: ""We do not know where it comes from or how it could be contaminated. It's been over 20 years since we started (the business) and it never happened before. It is really hurting our business.""Patrick Rubi says that the management of the cheese business is fully cooperating: ""The management has implemented all necessary measures to find the best possible level of hygiene. He has been very cooperative. This causes big problems for him and it's quite sad. But it was an industrial accident that may happen."" The village mayor, Jean-Luc Matray, himself a farmer, said he was ""reassured that there was no epidemic.""Note: The last case of listeriosis was detected in a dairy in Sainte-Agathe-la-Bouteresse, in July 2015, almost a year to the day.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Roanne, on the Loire River with a population of 45 105 residents (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanne>), and Belmont-de-la-Loire, with a population of about 1500 residents (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont-de-la-Loire>), are towns in the Loire Department in central France.
