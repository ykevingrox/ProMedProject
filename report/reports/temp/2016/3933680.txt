He said that the cases were reported between December 2015 and January 2016.Dr Tahir said that the cost of Lassa fever treatment is high, saying that the kits cost at least N 20 000 [USD 100] each, and the hospital had a limited number at present.He lamented that the testing centre for Lassa was far away from the state and that patients suffer waiting for the result to come out before proper treatment could commence.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Edo stateDate: Mon 11 Jan 2015Source: The Nation [edited]<http://thenationonlineng.net/lassa-fever-kills-one-in-edo/>One person has been confirmed dead in Edo State after being diagnosed with Lassa fever infection.Doctors at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo State are battling to save another victim currently on admission over Lassa fever.The state's Commissioner for Health, Dr. Heregie Aihanuwa, who confirmed the death, said 5 persons were hospitalized because of Lassa fever.

We are also working with medical experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) who are assisting the state to curb the spread."" He added: ""As you are all aware, the Federal Ministry of Health has confirmed that the country has been experiencing a Lassa fever outbreak in the past few weeks in some states, including Bauchi, Nassarawa, Niger, Taraba, Kano, Rivers, Edo and Oyo states. Lassa Fever is a zoonotic disease, which means that humans become infected by contact with infected animals. The animal host of the virus is a rodent (rat), which spreads the virus through its urine and faeces. Person-to-person transmission occurs in communities where people live in clusters and spreads faster in such crowded environments, especially under poor sanitary conditions [where the rodent reservoirs occur].""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Specific dates for when these infections were acquired or when the patients were hospitalized are not given. Presumably, these are December 2015 and January 2016 cases. Some of the December 2015 cases likely are included in the last Weekly Epidemiology Report, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160110.3924977).As noted in the comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150228.3199551: ""Lassa fever virus [LFV] is endemic in Nigeria, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country.""LFV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with an infected individual's viremic blood in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Several cases of transmission have occurred in hospitals.As the late Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived posting 20130131.1524034: ""In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multisystem disease. Rarely, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients.""The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the reservoir rodent host. In the absence of adequate infection control measures, person-to-person virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments, or in laboratories testing samples from patients.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
