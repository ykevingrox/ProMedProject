WHO Emergencies, yellow fever situation report [edited]<http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/situation-reports/2-june-2016/en/>A yellow fever outbreak was detected in Luanda, Angola late in December 2015. The 1st cases were confirmed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa on 19 Jan 2016 and by the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IP-D) on 20 Jan [2016]. Subsequently, a rapid increase in the number of cases has been observed.Summary-------Angola: 2893 suspected casesAs of 1 Jun 2016, Angola has reported 2893 suspected cases of yellow fever with 325 deaths. Among those cases, 788 have been laboratory confirmed. Despite extensive vaccination campaigns in several provinces, circulation of the virus persists.Cunene and Malanje provinces have reported, for the 1st time since the beginning of the outbreak, 5 autochthonous cases.Democratic Republic of The Congo: 52 laboratory confirmed casesOn 22 Mar 2016, the Ministry of Health of DRC confirmed cases of yellow fever in connection with Angola. The government officially declared the yellow fever outbreak on 23 Apr [2016]. As of 1 Jun [2016], DRC has reported 3 probable cases and 52 laboratory confirmed cases: 44 of those are imported from Angola, reported in Kongo Central, Kinshasa and Kwango (formerly Bandundu) provinces, 2 are sylvatic cases in Northern provinces, and 2 other autochthonous cases in Ndjili (Kinshasa) and in Matadi (Kongo Central). The possibility of locally acquired infection is under investigation for at least 4 non-classified cases.Uganda: 68 suspect casesIn Uganda, the Ministry of Health notified yellow fever cases in Masaka district on 9 Apr 2016. As of 1 Jun [2016], 68 suspected cases, of which 3 are probable and 7 are laboratory confirmed, have been reported from 3 districts: Masaka, Rukungiri and Kalangala. According to sequencing results, those clusters are not epidemiologically linked to Angola.The risk of spreadThe virus in Angola and DRC is largely concentrated in main cities; however there is a high risk of spread and local transmission to other provinces in both countries. There is also a high risk of potential spread to bordering countries especially those previously classified as low-risk for yellow fever disease (i.e. Namibia, Zambia) and where the population, travellers and foreign workers are not vaccinated against yellow fever.3 countries have reported confirmed yellow fever cases imported from Angola: Democratic Republic of The Congo (DRC) (44 cases), Kenya (2 cases) and People's Republic of China (11 cases). This highlights the risk of international spread through nonimmunised travellers.A further 3 countries have reported suspected cases of yellow fever: Republic of Congo (one case), Sao Tome and Principe (2 cases) and Ethiopia (22 cases). Investigations are ongoing to identify the vaccination status of the cases and determine if they are linked with Angola.Risk assessmentThe outbreak in Angola remains of high concern due to:- Persistent local transmission in Luanda despite the fact that approximately 8 million people have been vaccinated.- Local transmission has been reported in ten highly populated provinces including Luanda. Luanda Norte, Cunene and Malenge are the provinces that most recently reported local yellow fever transmission.- The continued extension of the outbreak to new provinces and new districts.- High risk of spread to neighbouring countries. As the borders are porous with substantial crossborder social and economic activities, further transmission cannot be excluded. Viraemic travelling patients pose a risk for the establishment of local transmission especially in countries where adequate vectors and susceptible human populations are present.- Risk of establishment of local transmission in other provinces where no autochthonous cases are reported.- High index of suspicion of ongoing transmission in hard-to-reach areas like Cabinda.- Inadequate surveillance system capable of identifying new foci or areas of cases emerging.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org> [As new cases are reported, the need for rapid response with vaccination efforts grows. The status in vaccination coverage in the affected countries is not mentioned. Previous reports have raised concerns about vaccine availability.

The Lunda Norte Provincial Health Director, Buagica Mambelo, told Lusa Monday [30 May 2016] that confirmation had come last week and that the Ministry of Health had already dispatched a team of specialists to the region to analyse the extent of the outbreak. Mambelo maintained that the situation was under control, with vaccination already ongoing and due to extend throughout the province following 4 cases of local transmission out of 9 suspected cases. The diamond mining province of Lunda Norte had been yellow fever free until 2 weeks ago with the 10-day long vaccination campaign reported to have covered 10 553 persons in the meanwhile. Angola has been coping with a yellow fever epidemic since December 2015, 1st breaking out in the capital of Luanda but having since spread to other provinces and claiming in the region of 300 lives thus far.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The spread of yellow fever to previously unaffected provinces is worrisome. The prompt vaccination of 10 553 individuals is encouraging, but the population of the province is not stated, so one does not know the proportion of the population is covered. Because the province is a diamond mining area bordered on the north and the east by the Congo DR, one might assume that there is significant cross-border movement or workers with the related risk of movement of YF virus-infected individuals.A map showing the location of Lunda Norte province can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/angola.gif>. - Mod.TY]******[3] Ghana, Brong-Ahafo and Volta regionsDate: Sat 4 Jun 2016Source: Joy Online [edited]<http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2016/June-4th/yellow-fever-strikes-in-brong-ahafo-volta-regions.php>[The Ghana Health Service issued the following press release:]Confirmed Cases of Yellow Fever (YF) -- Brong-Ahafo and Volta Regions---------------------------------------------------------------------Over the past 4 weeks, the Ghana Health Service has received reports of confirmed yellow fever (YF) cases from the Brong-Ahafo and Volta regions. A total of 4 cases with no deaths have been reported.[Of these,] 3 are from Jaman South district in the Brong-Ahafo region and one from Central Tongu district in the Volta Region.There is no need to panic as the cases are confined to a few communities in the aforementioned districts, and previous widespread vaccination in 2011 in those districts provided most people with immunity against yellow fever.Signs and Symptoms of Yellow FeverYellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease. It causes bleeding which may come out from any of the body openings (e.g.: the nose, mouth, bloody stools, vomiting blood at the end stage). The symptoms may also include fever with jaundice in the early stages and with multiple organ dysfunctions resulting in kidney and liver failure.TreatmentTreatment is mostly symptomatic.Mode of SpreadSpread is through the bite of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes.Preventive Measures1. Prevention is by vaccination -- The vaccine is very effective. One injection of the vaccine protects one for life.2. Avoidance and protection against mosquito bites.Containment Measures and Response Actions Done1. Public education on signs, symptoms and prevention.2. Yellow fever vaccination coverage in the affected districts has been assessed and found to be high in those districts. Preventive vaccination coverage was done in the affected communities in 2011 and yellow fever vaccination protects one for life.3. Planned selective reactive mop up vaccination in the affected communities/sub-districts.4. Alert sent to all regions and nearby districts of the affected areas.5. Surveillance has been enhanced across the country.Way ForwardThe risk of further transmission is low due to high yellow fever vaccination coverage in routine EPI and previous preventive vaccination campaign. However, we need to sustain enhanced surveillance, intensive public education of the disease, preventive measures and what to do if one suspects yellow fever.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not clear if the containment measures listed above have been implemented already. A delay of 4 weeks or more could provide ample time for continued ongoing transmission of the yellow fever (YF) virus if there are unvaccinated individuals in these 2 localities. The proportion of individuals in these areas who are unvaccinated is not mentioned. The reason for delaying official reporting for 4 weeks is not given. It is not clear if these cases are spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission, are imported from elsewhere, or are locally acquired cases from the urban transmission cycle. One hopes that these are isolated cases, and do not represent the beginning of another African YF outbreak.
