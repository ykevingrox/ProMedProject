Radio New Zealand [edited]<http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/300423/fiji-pink-eye-outbreak-sees-5000-cases-in-two-weeks>Health authorities in Fiji are urging people to observe strict personal hygiene as the country goes through a massive outbreak of conjunctivitis or pink eye.In the past 2 weeks [last 2 weeks of March 2016] alone the number of cases of the virus in one district of Suva [the capital of Fiji; located in Central Division] jumped from 700 to 5000 cases...Dr Kama said health authorities were not associating the outbreak with Cyclone Winston but were urging people with the virus to stay away from work and school and to only seek medical assistance if they developed bacterial infections.  ""You know personal sanitation is primary and that is what we are trying to advise to the community instead of running for antibiotics, which is probably unnecessary at this point in time if it is a virus,"" said Dr Kama. ""It should really take its course and personal sanitation is really important to adhere to.""Meanwhile, many health centres in Fiji are running out of eye drops, and it could be this weekend before stocks are replenished as the country deals with the conjuctivitis outbreak. FBC News reports the chief pharmacist, Apolosi Vosanibola, as saying replacement stocks of eye drops, such as chloramphenicol, which were due to arrive yesterday [31 Mar 2016], have been delayed. He said supplies should arrive in health centres and hospitals from this weekend.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[Photo from Fiji Sun:<http://fijisun.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Eye-decease-4-680x365.jpg>. - Mod.JWThe following has been extracted from my comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Conjunctivitis - Somalia: (BN) Mogadishu 20141207.3016591:Conjunctivitis is commonly referred to as ""red"" or ""pink"" eye, a sign of inflammation that is usually accompanied by a discharge of varying viscosity. Conjunctivitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, or toxins (such as chlorine in swimming pool water). A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis. A thick, yellow-green sticky discharge, often associated with morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids, strongly suggests a bacterial infection. Pain, photophobia, or blurred vision suggests a more serious disease process such as keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea and is accompanied by conjunctivitis.Large outbreaks of conjunctivitis, as is now occurring on Fiji, are commonly due to viruses (e.g., adenoviruses and enteroviruses), adenoviruses being most common (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf>). Conjunctivitis due to adenoviruses is spread through hand-to-eye contact or by contact with objects, such as ophthalmologic equipment contaminated with infectious tears, eye discharge, or respiratory discharges. There may be prolonged shedding of adenovirus; a person can be contagious a few days before developing symptoms to approximately 14 days after symptom onset, and adenovirus may be resistant to many common disinfectants and can remain viable for long periods in the environment (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf>). Treatment of viral conjunctivitis is supportive, which does not include antibiotics. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic and could be used as an eye drop for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis, not viral conjunctivitis. In addition, chloramphenicol is absorbed systemically from the eye and toxicity has been reported following its use. Bone marrow hypoplasia, including aplastic anaemia and death, has been reported, although rare, following topical use of chloramphenicol. Fiji is an island nation of more than 330 islands in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 1100 nautical miles (2000 km; 1300 mi) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji#Independence_.281970.29>).
