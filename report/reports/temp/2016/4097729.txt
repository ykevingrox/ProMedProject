The cough gets worse, and severe bouts of uncontrollable coughing can develop. Coughing bouts can be followed by vomiting, choking or taking a big gasping breath which causes a whooping sound.[Byline: Lisa Herbertson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Sat 5 Mar 2016Source: Daily Telegraph [edited]<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/whooping-cough-rise-booster-at-18-months-to-help-repel-rise-of-potential-killer/news-story/1b4da2e47a0392d51266d860889a50fa>The NSW Vaccine Centre has begun sending the vaccine to doctors, and all children born after 1 Oct 2014 will be required to have an 18 month booster for pertussis from April 2016, on top of jabs at 2, 4 and 6 months.There have been 2369 cases of whooping cough -- known medically as pertussis -- so far in 2016, compared with 1036 during the same period in 2015.The extra vaccination has been added to the national immunization schedule because immunity wanes between the 1st trio of vaccinations and the next at 4 years old. There has been an increase in the number of 2-9-year-olds catching the disease. Most immunized children in that age group do not develop severe cases, but they can transmit the disease to babies with no or little immunity.Almost all whooping cough deaths occur in babies too young to have received more than adequate doses of the vaccine, according to the federal government.""Parents are advised to ring the (medical) practice in advance to ensure that the vaccines have arrived,"" NSW Health said. Meanwhile, there has been a shortage of the vaccine available for non-essential recipients, such as carers and grandparents. ""In regards to supplies for other groups, NSW Health has been advised by vaccine manufacturers that a small amount of whooping cough vaccine has been released into the private market, and the situation with regard to the overall private supply should improve within the next few months,"" NSW Health said.Vaccination rates are improving since a Sunday Telegraph campaign prompted the federal government to stop parents who refuse vaccinations claiming tax subsidies for childcare or family benefits.[Byline: Jordan Baker & Keely McDonough]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The increase in pertussis cases in many areas around the world is no doubt multifactorial, relating to the up and down nature of pertussis over years, the waning immunity of the currently used acellular vaccine, the selection of _Bordetella pertussis_ strains less protected by the current vaccine, and the presence of non-vaccinated children. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/284>.]
