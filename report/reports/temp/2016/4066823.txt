If the article is indeed focusing on acute cases, then it does not acknowledge the relatively small number of adult acute cases that will develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Only 5-10 percent of adult acute cases will progress to chronic infection. The increase in hepatitis B cases, acute or chronic, is absolutely a cause for concern, but it can be expected that many of these cases will go on to resolve their acute infection.Thanks for all the work you do!
