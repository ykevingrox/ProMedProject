AllAfrica, Premium Times report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201604180040.html>The Katsina State Government said on Sunday [17 Apr 2016] that only 2 people died following the outbreak of Lassa fever in the area.Kabir Mustapha, the permanent secretary in the state's Ministry of Health, made this known to journalists in Katsina. He said that the disease was imported from neighbouring Kaduna state by the relatives of a deceased victim of the disease.Mr Mustapha said that 3 other people, who took active part in the burial of the corpse of the deceased victim, contracted the disease. According to him, the those infected were immediately taken to the isolation centre at Babbar-ruga, to avoid spreading the disease. He told reporters that another case of the disease was imported to the state from Gwagwalada, Abuja although the patient later died at the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina.The permanent secretary said that 11 medical staff of the centre had been quarantined and 7 of them tested negative following laboratory tests that were carried out on them. Mr Mustapha said that out of 54 blood samples that were taken for laboratory test, 6 tested positive to Lassa fever. He stated that the infected people who responded to treatment were discharged.The permanent secretary, who urged members of the public not to stigmatise those that were treated and discharged, advised them to report any suspected case of the disease to the nearest medical facility to prevent the disease from spreading further.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These cases are related to an earlier case reported on 6 Apr 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160407.4143654). In that instance, a man tested positive to Lassa fever in Katsina city in Katsina state following contact with the corpse of his brother who died from the disease in Kaduna city in Kaduna state. The samples of the man and 7 others who participated in the burial rites were taken and his turned out positive. Now, 2 of these individuals died and 3 others are in isolation. Fortunately, none of the medical staff had become infected.Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures, as apparently was the case with the individual who died in Kaduna where family members were in contact with the corpse. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protective equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety. Direct contact with the corpses of individuals who died of Lassa fever is to be avoided.Images of mastomys mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1321>. - Mod.TY]
