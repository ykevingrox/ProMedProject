She said 43 patients are being treated at medical centers in Sakow town, and 21 in Bu'ale. Mohamed added the government is doing its best to handle the health conditions of the patients, and will bring medical assistance to those towns as soon possible. However, the insecure situation in those towns might prevent health officials from providing medical assistance to those affected since the regions are currently under Al-Shabaab control.Analysts say that enhanced rainfall related to El Nino in Somalia early this year [2016], leading to some flooding and displacement of families, can precipitate the outbreak of a number of diseases, including diarrhea, cholera and typhoid. This is due to exposure to contaminated water as well as disruption or destruction of vital infrastructure such as health clinics, schools and roads.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera: Southern SomaliaDate 26 Mar 2016Source: Horseed Media [edited]<https://horseedmedia.net/2016/03/26/cholera-kills-over-20-people-as-drought-crisis-deepens-in-somalia/>At least 20 people have been confirmed dead in Southern Somalia following an outbreak of cholera, Horseed Media reports. The outbreak of the epidemic is linked to the shortage of water in the middle Shabelle region, with the popular river Shabelle drying up. Most of the people died in the villages of Mandera, Ba'adley and Raqeyle.Earlier this month [April 2016], at least 5 children died of a cholera outbreak in the same region, with residents complaining about a lack of assistance from the aid agencies and government. Residents are worried that the small villages could be just as vulnerable to the outbreak due to lack of sufficient medicines and hospitals in the area.Cholera, a highly contagious intestinal infection, is transmitted by water soiled by human waste. The disease leads to diarrhoea, dehydration and death if untreated.Meanwhile, Somalia is facing its worst drought in decades. The humanitarian crisis has hit many regions in Southern, Central and Northern Somalia, with many people needing emergency aid.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to 5 days, and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients, according to WHO.These reports of cholera in south Somalia reveal the cause of death of the children there posed in ProMED-mail as ""Undiagnosed illness - Somalia: (JD) fatal, RFI"" [20160423.4178912]. Provision of clean water is vital to health and should be the top priority of public health programs worldwide. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/125>.]
