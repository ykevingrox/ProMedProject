Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/yellow-fever-update-the-numbers-namibia-imported-case-local-transmission-in-kinshasa-32006/>The Angola yellow fever outbreak continues to grow and expand as UN health officials put the number of suspected cases at 2023 since the outbreak began in December [2015]. Of these cases, 650 have been laboratory confirmed. Of the total, 258 deaths have been reported. In the week to 24 Apr [2016], 115 new suspect cases, 8 new deaths and 36 new confirmed yellow fever cases were reported.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 3 countries have reported yellow fever cases exported from Angola: China (11 confirmed cases), Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (16 confirmed cases) and Kenya (2 confirmed cases).In the DRC, as of 26 Apr [2016], a total of 37 yellow fever cases (16 confirmed and 21 probable) were reported in DRC. All 16 confirmed cases previously travelled to Angola. The results for the 21 probable cases are pending. In addition, at least 2 probable cases of locally acquired yellow fever infection have been reported in Kinshasa and in Matadi (Kongo Central province).In Uganda, 39 suspect cases of yellow fever cases have been reported in 7 districts as of 27 Apr [2016] and 6 cases have been laboratory confirmed (5 in Masaka and one in Rukungiri). Based on available information, the clusters of yellow fever in Uganda do not seem to be epidemiologically linked to Angola.WHO states that ""No suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported in Congo, Namibia or Zambia"". However, media accounts report Namibia, which shares a long and porous border with Angola, has reported the 1st imported yellow fever case. Namibia health minister, Bernard Haufiku, said Wednesday [27 Apr 2016] that a case was reported in Ohangwena in northern Namibia. Haufiku said the patient had been to Lubango in Angola.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There are now 3 African countries with ongoing yellow fever (YF) transmission: Angola, Uganda and the DR Congo. This has raised serious concerns about vaccine availability, especially if the outbreaks grow outside Luanda, Angola; Uganda; and the DR Congo. So far, Angola has been the only reported source of YF cases imported into other countries. However, if the outbreaks in Uganda and the DR Congo are not brought under control quickly, these countries could become sources of exported cases as well. There is no mention of the reported YF case in Mauritania ex Angola in the above summary. One hopes that the Namibia case, ex Angola, remains at just one.The URL above has a map of Africa showing the location of the countries mentioned. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>.]
