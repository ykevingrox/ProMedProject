Saudi MOH [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-03-23-001.aspx>As of noon today [23 Mar 2016], there have been a total of:1358 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including577 deaths [reported case fatality rate 42.5%],761 recoveries, and20 currently active cases, including 3 asymptomatic infections.In the past 24 hours there have been:2 newly confirmed cases0 newly reported fatalities2 newly reported recoveries.Information on newly confirmed cases (2):1. A 57 year old Saudi male from Buraidah, non-healthcare worker, currently in a critical condition. Classification under investigation but reported as no contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.2. An 84 year old Saudi female from Alrass, non-healthcare worker, currently in a stable condition. Classification under investigation but reported as no contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.Information on newly reported recoveries (2):1. A 72 year old Saudi male from Riyadh, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities. [I could not find a 72 year old Saudi male from Riyadh reported in 2016; there was a 72 year old male reported from Ruwaidah Alard on 26 Feb 2016 and one from Alartawia on 29 Feb 2016, both locations in Riyadh province. - Mod.MPP]2. A 47 year old Saudi male from Taif, non-healthcare worker, no history of co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 14 Mar 2016 at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At the time of initial confirmation was classified as a secondary household contact. - Mod.MPP].--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Cases continue to be identified in Buraidah (Qassim province). Alrass is located in Qassim province, approximately 94 km to the south west of Buraidah, so it is possible that the individual reported from Alrass may have had contact in Buraidah where there has been ongoing transmission in the healthcare setting. On the daily map of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of daily reported MERS-CoV cases [available at the source URL], deaths and recoveries, the map shows 2 newly confirmed cases in Buraidah, supporting this hypothesis. Since 3 Mar 2016, there have been 31 cases of laboratory confirmed infection with MERS-CoV in Buraidah. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia - WHO update 23 Mar 2016Date: 23 Mar 2016Source: WHO Global Alert and Response Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/23-march-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Between [15 and 16 Mar 2016], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including one death.
