UCLA Newsroom [edited]<http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/increase-in-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-hinders-treatment-of-kidney-infections>The increase in illnesses and deaths linked to medication-resistant bacteria has been well-documented by researchers and received extensive public attention in recent years. Now, UCLA-led research shows how these bacteria are making it more difficult to treat a common but severe kidney infection.Pyelonephritis -- infection of the kidney usually caused by _Escherichia coli_ bacteria and which can start as a urinary tract infection -- causes fever, back pain and vomiting. About half of people infected require hospitalization. If not treated with effective antibiotics, it can cause sepsis and death.In a UCLA-led study based on data from 10 large hospital emergency departments around the country, almost 12 per cent of people diagnosed with pyelonephritis had infections resistant to the standard class of antibiotic used in treatment, fluoroquinolone (for example, ciprofloxacin [Cipro]). That's up from 4 per cent in a similar study conducted a decade ago. In some cities, and among some people with certain risk factors -- such as international travel or recent hospitalization or treatment with an antibiotic -- fluoroquinolone resistance rates exceeded 20 per cent.The new study [1], published in the September [2016] issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, also documents the emergence of infections caused by a specific strain of _E. coli_ that is resistant to additional types of antibiotics, severely limiting treatment options. That strain, dubbed ESBL for the antibiotic-destroying enzymes it produces (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases), was not detected in the previous study. The enzymes were 1st detected in 1979 and are most often found in developing nations.Currently, there are only a few intravenous antibiotic options to treat ESBL-related infections, and no oral antibiotics that are consistently effective.""This is a very real example of the threat posed by the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, which greatly complicates treatment of infection,"" said Dr David Talan, the study's lead author and a professor in the department of emergency medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He is also a professor in the department of medicine, division of infectious diseases.The study included 453 people diagnosed with kidney infection. The study participants were diagnosed between July 2013 and December 2014 in 10 emergency departments at large hospitals around the country, including Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar, which is operated by Los Angeles County.Researchers reported that:The rates of ESBL-related infections varied from 0 per cent to more than 20 per cent, depending on the location of the emergency room and patient risk factors. About one in 3 people infected with ESBL-producing _E. coli_ had no traditional risk factors for antibiotic resistance, suggesting the bacterial strain is now endemic in the United States and healthy people are also at risk. About 3 of every 4 people infected with ESBL-producing _E. coli_ were initially treated with antibiotics ineffective against that particular strain of bacteria, placing them at risk for poor outcomes. Talan and his research colleagues recommended the development of new medications and new guidelines calling for treatment with different types and combinations of antibiotics. They also recommended physicians evaluating treatment options pay close attention to antibiotic resistance rates in their regions and quickly test bacteria samples to determine specific strains.The research was supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by Merck.[1.

Available at <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/9/pdfs/16-0148.pdf>.][byline: Phil Hampton]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In the study reported by the news report above, of 521 patients who sought care for acute pyelonephritis (that is, a kidney infection) in hospital emergency rooms (emergency departments or EDs) in the US between July 2013 and December 2014, 85.6 per cent patients had a community-acquired infection; _E. coli_ caused 86.9 per cent of the infections (453); 29 of the 453 (6.4 per cent) _E. coli_ produced an ESBL; and 84.6 per cent (22) of 26 ESBL-producing _E. coli_ were the CTX-M-15 ESBL type [1]. About 12 per cent were cipro resistant overall, but among the 29 ESBL-producing _E. coli_, 81.5 per cent were resistant to ciprofloxacin. No carbapenem resistance was detected. Of the 29 patients with ESBL infection and 53 with fluoroquinolone-resistant infection, 22 (75.9 per cent) and 24 (45.3 per cent), respectively, were initially treated with in vitro inactive antimicrobial drugs. The investigators conclude that the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance exceeds treatment guideline thresholds for alternative antimicrobial drug strategies and community-acquired ESBL-producing _E. coli_ infection has emerged in some U.S. communities.The results of this study are consistent with those of other studies that show an increasing incidence of community-acquired infection due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producing _E. coli_. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the commonest infection caused by ESBL-producing _E. coli_, but these organisms are also seen in other types of infections, such as intra-abdominal infections (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897323/>).There are multiple types of ESBLs, such as TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and OXA, each with multiple subtypes (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/18/4/657.full>). Community-acquired ESBL-producing _E. coli_ have frequently been CTX-M-type ESBLs (<http://www.jwatch.org/id201303130000003/2013/03/13/community-acquisition-esbl-producing-e-coli>, <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/7/07-0094_article>).ESBL-producing _E. coli_ are resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, except carbapenems. The genes encoding ESBLs are located mainly on transferable plasmids, often associated with other antibiotic-resistance genes, including genes that encode resistance to fluoroquinolones (for example, ciprofloxacin), aminoglycosides (for example, gentamicin), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. ESBL-producing _E. coli_ that cause urinary tract infection have frequently remained susceptible to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin, 2 oral drugs (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21706226>).Because of increasing rates of antibiotic resistance of _E. coli_ to current standard empiric antibiotic regimens, guidelines for the management of community-acquired infections have been revised. For example, fosfomycin or nitrofurantoin are now recommended for the 1st-line empirical oral treatment of community-acquired uncomplicated UTIs (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/e103.full>). Selecting an appropriate antibiotic regimen to prevent or empirically treat infections after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy has also become problematic because of the high prevalence of rectal carriage of antibiotic-resistant strains of _E. coli_ (<http://jcm.asm.org/content/50/12/4157.full>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
