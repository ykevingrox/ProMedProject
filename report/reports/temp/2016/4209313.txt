CIDRAP [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/05/ebola-scan-may-05-2016>A study of Ebola virus disease survivors in Guinea has added to previous evidence that the virus can persist for as long as 9 months in the semen of survivors, reinforcing the concern about a risk of sexual transmission for months after recovery.An international team of researchers tested 98 semen samples from 68 Ebola survivors in Conakry and Macenta, Guinea, from March through October 2015, according to their 3 May 2016 report in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for Ebola RNA were positive for 10 samples collected from 8 men up to 276 days (9 months) after their 1st symptoms.The proportion of specimens that tested positive decreased over time, with positive results for 28.6% of specimens (4 of 14) obtained between 1 and 3 months after disease onset, 16.7% (3 of 18) collected at 4 to 6 months, and 6.5% (2 of 31) obtained at 7 to 9 months, the report says.The researchers did not determine whether the samples contained infectious virus. ""Semen probably does not remain infectious during the whole period, and viral isolation and sequencing will soon be performed ... to determine the infectivity of samples,"" they wrote.In a study published in October 2015, Ebola RNA was found in the semen of 11 of 43 Ebola survivors who were tested between 7 and 9 months after their illness. And reports published in 2015 suggested that an Ebola case in a Liberian woman was probably caused by sexual transmission from her husband, an Ebola survivor.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that Ebola survivors abstain from sex or use condoms for up to 6 months after Ebola infection if semen testing is unavailable.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Also see a 2nd report on findings: 5 May 2016 Guinea: Ebola virus can reside in a survivor's semen up to 12 months, study finds<http://www.africanews.com/2016/05/05/ebola-virus-can-reside-in-a-survivor-s-semen-up-to-12-months-study-finds/>. A new study conducted in Guinea confirms the Ebola virus (EBOV) may remain in a survivor's semen up to one year. The new report confirms the study conducted in October 2015 in Sierra Leone. Researchers believe that fragments of the virus could remain permanently in the body of survivors and pose a danger for their sexual contacts [those who had contact, intimate and otherwise, with the recovering EVD males]. The French and Guinean researchers who have followed the 450 healed patients have performed 98 levels of sperm testing on 68 men. The Ebola virus has been detected on 8 of them 9 months after they were healed. The researchers also noted that the persistence of the virus in the seminal fluid decreased with time.According to researchers, the virus was present in 28.5 percent of samples collected between 1-3 months [following being declared free from EVD]. Between the 10th and the 12th month, it was estimated that 3.5 percent of the samples tested positive for Ebola virus before disappearing completely at the end of one year.Prior to the outbreak, Ebola virus had only been detected in the semen of a few male survivors by cell culture (maximum duration 82 days after disease onset).According to the Institute of Research for Development based in Guinea in collaboration with other agencies, these results ""put the emphasis on the need to recommend, at the international level, the use of condoms by survivors in the months following their healing.""Citation:MS Sow et al.

It appears rare that individuals [3.5% (1 of 29]) have detectable RNA up to one year in the semen, and 0% (0 of 6) beyond 12 months.An earlier report on survivors in Sierra Leone found viral RNA up to 284 days (9 months) after onset of disease, with a decreasing trend in both in proportion of PCR-positive semen specimens and viral quantity over time [Deen GF et al. Ebola RNA persistence in semen of Ebola virus disease survivors--preliminary report. N Engl J Med 2015; doi:10.1056/ NEJMoa1511410]. This current report from Guinea adds further evidence of long-term persistence of viral RNA for up to 9 months among survivors, with the same decreasing trend over time. As in Sierra Leone, [the authors] cannot yet draw conclusions about the infectivity of the semen.I recommend reading the commentary by Dr. Ian Crozier cited below which discusses the findings.Commentary:Ebola Virus RNA in the Semen of Male Survivors of Ebola Virus Disease: The Uncertain Gravitas of a Privileged Persistenceby I Crozier, J Infect Dis.
