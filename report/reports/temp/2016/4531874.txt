The pathogenic bacteria live in mice and mongooses, and rivers and soil become infected by their urine.

They advise people to visit a doctor if they develop a headache or fever within 2 weeks after an activity that puts them in contact with a possible source.--Communicated by:Jenny Dixon<Dixon.jenny@gmail.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Jenny Dixon for her contribution.Leptospirosis is endemic to Okinawa with periodic outbreaks in August or September following significant rainfall.
