""You just don't think about anything jumping at you in your yard and biting you,"" she told WDBJ7 Monday [18 Jul 2016] afternoon.She said she was working on the plants behind her home last Thursday, when a coyote came at her from another yard.""I heard nothing until the coyote had leaped over the fence and was in my face and knocked me over backwards,"" she said in an interview, ""and in the meantime when I put my hands up, he or she bit my finger.""She says the animal was light grey, bigger than a dog and very thin. She screamed, and the animal ran away.""Do you think you'll kind of keep an eye over your shoulder,"" we asked? ""I'm quite positive I will,"" she said. ""Maybe I'll work in the front yard a while. Somebody can at least see me as they drive by,"" she laughed.This victim has had the 1st of 4 [post exposure prophylaxis, PEP] rabies shots.She's a pianist and piano teacher, and her right index finger is still tender, but she expects to be playing again soon.[Byline: Joe Dashiell]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Pennsylvania - fox, human exposure [This incident occurred in Hall County, Georgia, not Pennsylvania.

That treatment includes post-exposure treatment of immune globulin injection at the site of the bite along with a series of 4 rabies vaccine injections in the arm muscle (deltoid) over a 14-day period.The cat was humanely euthanized. [Yet if the woman's dog was also attacked by the cat, what has happened to the dog? Was it vaccinated against rabies? Is it in quarantine? - Mod.TG]Anyone who may have had contact with the white, grey and black cat on or before 13 Jul 2016 is being asked to call the Niagara County Department of Health Environmental Division at 439-7444. A public health expert will evaluate and advise any caller on a course of action.The cat was the 1st positive case of rabies in a domesticated animal in the county since 2010 and tested positive on the same day as a bat from Hartland and a raccoon from Niagara Falls. In total, 7 animals (5 raccoons, a bat and a cat) have tested positive for the rabies virus in 2016: Two in Niagara Falls, 1 in Youngstown, 1 in Royalton, 2 in Hartland and 1 in Wheatfield.Rabies is an incurable, fatal disease caused by a virus that attacks the central nervous system.Public Health Director Daniel Stapleton warns, ""Avoid contact with all stray domestic animals and wildlife. Do not feed or touch them. Do not feed your pets outside. Cover your garbage cans with tight-fitting lids. I cannot emphasize this enough. Stray and wild animals can carry dangerous diseases, as well as cause serious injuries.""Animals exhibiting strange or sickly behavior should be reported to a local law enforcement agency or call the Environmental Health Division at 439-7444.The Niagara County Department of Health Environmental Division offers free rabies vaccination clinics for dogs, cats and ferrets several times a year. The next free clinic is scheduled for 9 a.m. on 17 Sep 2016 at the Town of Lockport Highway Department, 6560 Dysinger Road.

[Animals may also be lethargic and quiet. Not all animals may demonstrate choking or drooling, especially if it is early in the course of the disease. Please refer to the information later in this posting. - Mod.TG]The Health Department is also reminding residents to keep their pets' rabies vaccinations up to date.

The cat was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on Monday and was confirmed to have rabies on Tuesday [26 Jul 2016].""Please play it safe and give animals their space, particularly wild and stray animals,"" said Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services (BEHS). ""Hundreds of South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies every year. Rabies is a deadly virus that is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body, usually through a bite or contact with an open wound or areas such as the mouth or eyes,"" said Craig.In addition to being cautious around wild or stray animals, keeping your pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family and your pets from this fatal disease.The cat is the 3rd animal in Spartanburg County to test positive for rabies in 2016. There have been 63 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide this year [2016]. In 2015, Spartanburg County had 5 rabies cases out of 130 statewide. [This marks quite an increase in the county. Is it better reporting and record keeping, or is there a need for rabies baiting of wild animals? Should rabies reminders about pets and rabies drives be more frequent? These are questions the authorities should be asking regarding the increase in the number of cases this year (2016) vs last year. - Mod.TG]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The best way to protect yourself and your family is to vaccinate your animals, your pets, and any farm stock you come in contact with regularly. Farm stock or large animals are not immune to rabies. Sadly, when horses or cattle become infected with rabies, it often has very tragic situations associated with it. If you have show animals, please vaccinate them. It may save your pet, your investment and your life, or the life of your child.Some of these articles mention rabies drives. Counties and municipalities having rabies present should be having frequent clinics and client education public service announcements on local stations regarding reminders to vaccinate pets and where the clinics are.Rabies does not always produce a vicious animal. Sometimes the animals may be quiet and withdrawn. Information regarding the usual appearance of animals is provided below.There are 2 forms of rabies: furious and paralytic (sometimes referred to as dumb). The signs described herein are characteristic of the different forms, but an individual rabid animal would not necessarily show all the signs.Furious rabies- The animal displays signs of extreme restlessness and aggression.- It attacks objects, other animals, and even its own limbs.- Fits of furious rabies generally alternate with periods of withdrawal.Paralytic (dumb) rabies- The animal may become withdrawn and seek seclusion.- It may no longer be afraid of humans.- A generally nocturnal animal may become active during the day.- Signs of paralysis: Head and neck paralysis may result in an abnormal facial expression, excessive salivation, slackness of the head and jaw, and the making of strange sounds. Body paralysis normally begins with the hind legs and spreads to the rest of the body. Species-specific signsThe signs described above are common to all species. Nevertheless, more specific signs can be observed in certain species of domestic animals infected with the rabies virus.CattleCattle rarely develop furious rabies but, when they do, they may attack humans. A characteristic sign of rabies in cattle is abnormal bellowing, which may be continuous or intermittent, and lasts until the animal dies. Milk production in dairy cows infected with rabies will drop off suddenly.HorsesHorses may show signs of distress and agitation. These signs, accompanied by rolling, give the appearance of colic. Rabid horses can be prone to aggression and self-mutilation.PigsRabid pigs display rapid chewing, lack of coordination, and repetitive headshaking.SheepSheep infected with the rabies virus have a hoarse bleat, tend to lick objects, and become aggressive.TreatmentThere are no treatments for wild or domestic animals exposed to the rabies virus. Death generally occurs within 10 days of the onset of clinical signs.The clinical signs in the various animals have been extracted from: <http://www.rage.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?formes-de-rage-en>. - Mod.TG]
