La RepÌ¼blica [in Spanish, trans by K, Soderholm edited]<http://larepublica.pe/impresa/sociedad/765091-orepuche-virus-que-avanza-en-cusco>The Oropouche virus gained ground in the district of Pichari [La ConvenciÌ n Province, Cusco Region] with 36 confirmed infected, followed by Echarate with 6; Kimbiri, 2; Yanatile, 2; Quellouno, 1; Yuveni, 3; and Palma Real, 1.The specialist Dario Mendoza Navarro, executive director of Health Intelligence of the Regional Health Authority (Diresa), admitted that the progress of infection is accelerated in the jungle areas of Cusco. ""We are entering the (highest) peak of the disease. We do not know if this will continue. That will depend on the results of the work we are doing,"" he said.It is the 1st time an outbreak has occurred in the Cusco region. It generally occurs in Madre de Dios and the neighboring country of Brazil.Navarro explained that Oropouche is transmitted by the blood-sucking mosquito [biting midge] _Culicoides paraensis_. A virus-infected patient develops symptoms similar to those of dengue fever. That is, its onset is abrupt, accompanied by headache, loss of appetite, muscle aches, joint aches, and vomiting. In some patients it can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis, but in general, this kind of evolution does not occur.The mosquito has been present in the Cusco jungle since last year [2015]. Health reported 2 imported cases from Madre de Dios in Pichari and Kimbiri 6 months ago.Navarro said that while Oropouche has similar characteristics to dengue, is not ultimately fatal. While dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses are transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, Oropouche is transmitted by the vector _Culicoides paraensis_. _Aedes_ live in places where there is stagnant water, and _Culicoides_ live in organic waste such as fruit peels and excrement.The Regional Health Authority (Diresa) launched a plan to control the outbreak. A brigade of doctors and other specialists is working to identify patients to control the outbreak. ""Hopefully it will not become an epidemic, because as you know, the mosquito has begun to spread unchecked,"" noted the expert.The team has already begun to recruit people who develop any of the symptoms caused by the virus. In addition, it is informing the public about the characteristics of the mosquito. Navarro advised the inhabitants of La ConvenciÌ n to ""avoid exposure in the evenings because that's when the mosquitoes come out to do their work.""According to Dr Pablo Grajeda, of the area of epidemiology, the mosquito may also be present in the district of Lares in Calca province. Grajeda expressed concern, because the budget allocated to prevent its spread is minimal.[Byline: JosÌ© VÌ ctor Salcedo]--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[In addition to Peru, outbreaks of the Oropouche fever virus have been described in rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. As the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has noted, ""the Oropouche virus exists in nature in 2 cycles, the wild and urban-epidemic cycles. In the wild cycle, wildlife such as primates, sloths, and certain arthropods serve as reservoirs, with the flies acting as vectors. In the urban epidemic cycle, the infection cycle remains vector-human-vector, with humans acting as the principal hosts. Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group.""The disease produces symptoms similar to dengue. It has an incubation period of 4-8 days, with a range of between 3-12 days. The onset of symptoms is sudden, usually with a fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, chills, sometimes nausea, and persistent vomiting up to 5-7 days. Meningoencephalitis has been known to occur occasionally. Symptoms last from 5-7 days; however, full recovery can take up to several weeks in some patients"" (see PAHO Epidemiological Alert<http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3084&Itemid=2206>). Fortunately, Oropouche fever is not fatal. - Mod.TYMaps of Peru can be seen at <http://www.geographicguide.com/pictures/peru-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/26874>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
