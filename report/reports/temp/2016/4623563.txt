New York Times, Reuters report [edited]<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/world/measles-children-unicef.html>Despite vaccination efforts measles kills 350 children a day, report says--------------------------------------------------------------------The number of deaths from measles has fallen by 79 per cent worldwide since 2000, thanks mainly to mass vaccination campaigns, but more than 350 children still die from the disease every day, global health experts said on Thu 10 Nov (2016).In a report on global efforts to ""make measles history,"" the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, the World Health Organization and other health agencies said the fight against measles was being hampered not by a lack of tools or knowledge, but by a lack of political will to get every child immunized against measles. ""Without this commitment, children will continue to die from a disease that is easy and cheap to prevent,"" said Robin Nandy, UNICEF's head of immunization.The report said measles vaccination campaigns and a global increase in routine vaccine coverage had saved about 20.3 million young lives from 2000 to 2015. But coverage is patchy, and, in some countries, a majority of children are not vaccinated. In 2015, about 20 million babies missed their shots, and about 134 000 children died from the disease. According to the report, half of all unvaccinated babies and 75 per cent of deaths from measles occur in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan.Measles is a highly contagious virus that can spread by direct contact or through the air. It can be prevented with a widely available and inexpensive vaccine.Published by UNICEF, WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the report said that outbreaks of measles in various countries -- caused by gaps in immunization -- are still a major problem. In 2015, outbreaks were reported in Egypt, Ethiopia, Germany, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia, the report said, with those in Germany and Mongolia mostly affecting older people. Those outbreaks, the report went on to say, highlighted the need to immunize young people who had missed out on vaccinations.Measles, the report added, also tends to flare up during conflicts or humanitarian crises, evidenced by outbreaks last year in Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Political will is critical to pushing forward with resources and a program to vaccinate all children against measles (and mumps and rubella). Until that happens, outbreaks will continue to occur. - Mod.LK]******[2] Canada (British Columbia)Date: Fri 4 Nov 2016Source: CBC News [edited]<http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/northern-health-investigating-measles-warning-from-prince-george-school-1.3836850>Northern Health is investigating a possible measles outbreak in Prince George [British Columbia (BC) province] but says a letter informing parents the disease has been confirmed is ""premature."" On Thursday [3 Nov 2016], parents of children at Foothills Elementary [school] received a letter informing them a student had been infected with measles. ""A confirmed cases of measles has come to our attention,"" read the letter from principal L Bryce. The letter asked parents to inform the school if their own children were to contract measles.Disease 'unlikely': Northern Health-----------------------------------""Unfortunately that letter was sent out a bit prematurely,"" said Dr Raina Fumerton of Northern Health. ""It's unlikely given the history this is indeed going to be a measles case."" Dr Fumerton explained that people in Canada usually get measles from travel and it doesn't appear the student in this case has been abroad or in contact with anyone who has been abroad. She said Northern Health is taking a ""precautionary approach"" and testing for the disease and that results from the tests could arrive as early as next week. I always use these as good opportunities to remind people that it's a good idea to make sure that your kids are up-to-date for all their vaccines in the event that measles does get [reintroduced].""Letter was sent as a precaution: school district------------------------------------------------School District 57 [superintendent] Marilyn Marquis-Forster said the letter confirming a case of the measles was sent out as a precaution. ""The information that got relayed to the principal led her to believe that it was a confirmed case. She wanted to be sure she got on top of it, but it turned out that it hadn't been fully investigated."" Marquis-Forster said a new letter would be sent to parents today informing them of the mistake.'Leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths'---------------------------------------------Measles was thought to have been virtually eliminated from North America over a decade ago, but outbreaks like a recent one in the Fraser Valley [2014: see <http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/measles-outbreak-in-b-c-s-fraser-valley-declared-over-1.1796208> and ProMED-mail. Measles update (15) 20140416.2406909. - Mod.SH ] have reinforced the need for education around the dangers of the disease.The Canadian Medical Association has advocated for rules that would allow schools to force parents to disclose their children's immunization status. Last year [2015] there were only 10 confirmed cases of measles in all of BC. But measles remains ""one of the most contagious communicable diseases"" and ""the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children worldwide,"" according to the BC Centre for Disease Control [BCCDC].In 2015 the BCCDC worked with Immunize BC and regional health authorities to warn parents about the risk of measles and the importance of getting a vaccine. The campaign was launched following an outbreak of more than 400 cases of measles in the Fraser Valley in 2014. Measles was thought to have been virtually eliminated from North America over a decade ago, but outbreaks like a recent one in the Fraser Valley have reinforced the need for education around the dangers of the disease.[byline: Andrew Kurjata]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Prince George is the largest city in northern British Columbia.
