EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]re: Rabies, animal, human (08): South Africa (GT) RFI 20160812.4413319-----------------------------------------------------In response to the RFI (request for information) sent to EpiCore members in South Africa, we received the following information:The 2 people were receiving post-exposure prophylaxis, according to contacts in the NICD [National Institute for Communicable Diseases].In 2016, up to 27 Jul 2016, there have been 2 human rabies cases in South Africa (<http://www.nicd.ac.za/assets/files/Update%20rabies.pdf>).--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We are very grateful to the EpiCore member who provided the above information.The following information addresses the rabies situation in South Africa as of July 2016.Communicable Diseases CommuniquÌ©, July 2016, Vol. 15(7): Update on rabies in South Africa <http://www.nicd.ac.za/assets/files/Update%20rabies.pdf>""The National Institute for Communicable Diseases confirmed the diagnosis of rabies in a 6 year old girl from Clocolan in the eastern Free State Province on 20 Jul 2016. She presented with symptoms in keeping with rabies and passed away on 19 Jul [2016] at a Bloemfontein hospital. Neither the patient prior to her death, nor her family, reported or recalled exposure to a suspected rabid animal. However, rabies is endemic in South Africa amongst dogs, jackals and mongooses, and can be transmitted from infected animals to humans through minor, seemingly harmless exposures to rabid animals. Scratches to the skin, or licks of mucous membranes such as the eyes or nose, may constitute an exposure. Sequencing of the patient sample identified the rabies virus as canid biotype. It is therefore most likely that the infection was contracted from a rabid dog, cat or other domestic animal. This is the 2nd human case reported for South Africa for 2016 to date. The 1st case was diagnosed in KwaZulu-Natal Province in January 2016.""A countrywide shortage of human rabies immunoglobulin (or HRIG) has been reported since May 2016. As the shortage is expected to last several months, provision has been made for the emergency importation of equine-derived rabies immunoglobulin (or ERIG) under Section 21 licensing. The indication for the use of ERIG is the same as for HRIG -- that is, category 3 rabies virus exposures. The dosage of ERIG is 40 IU/kg (versus 20 IU/kg for HRIG) and it is important to observe recipients of the product for at least 30 minutes due to very small risk (1 in 150 000 administrations) of anaphylactic shock. More information about ERIG and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis can be obtained from the guidelines section of the NICD website (<http://www.nicd.ac.za/?page=guidelines&id=73>).""Since 16 Apr to 7 Jul 2016, rabies has been confirmed in 10 jackals, 4 cattle, 2 dogs and 1 honey badger in Gauteng Province by Gauteng Veterinary Services and Agriculture Research Council - Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. Although sporadic cases of rabies are reported from Gauteng Province historically, the spike in the jackal cases in the past 2 months is concerning. Efforts to vaccinate pets in the affected areas have been ongoing and pet owners are reminded that they are responsible to ensure that their cats and dogs are vaccinated for rabies according to the required schedule.""Source: Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases, NICD-NHLS [National Health Laboratory Service]; <januszp@nicd.ac.za>"". - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3070>.]
