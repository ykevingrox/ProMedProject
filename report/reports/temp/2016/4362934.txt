EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited][The following response was received from an EpiCore Surveillance Project member regarding norovirus in Palermo, Sicily, Italy. - Mod.LL]I received preliminary information about this event by media. I live in the same district of the resort where the incident occurred. It looks like the hypothesis that the Health Authorities thought more plausible was cross-transmission mediated by objects or surfaces starting from a child with diarrhoea. In the same interval of time, however, it was forbidden to drink municipal water of some areas near the resort and [samples were] submitted for repeated microbiological tests. No new cases were apparent since the opening of the resort.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail thanks the EpiCore Surveillance Project member who submitted the comment. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54422>.]
