Hawaii News Now [edited]<http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/32714584/department-of-transportation-employee-infected-with-hepatitis-a>The [Hawaii] State Health Department has confirmed a case of hepatitis A in a State Department of Transportation employee, raising the number of confirmed cases to 135.The Department of Health [DOH] said on Monday [8 Aug 2016] that it is getting closer to finding out what is causing the outbreak. ""The indications are that whatever it is, this is not a fresh product; it's probably something that keeps for a while, so [it is] frozen or dried or something,"" state epidemiologist Dr Sarah Park said. All Department of Transportation employees, who may have been exposed, have been contacted [and] are being offered vaccinations.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 3 experts from epidemiology, infectious diseases and clinical care are in Hawaii assisting the DOH with the investigation.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There are likely many more cases that are subclinical (without symptoms) or anicteric (without jaundice). It is clear that the peak time for infectivity with hepatitis A is before symptoms occur when virus concentrations in the stool are at their highest. If the epidemiological curve shows cases occurring outside the incubation period of a point source exposure and such cases are not linked to other cases, the suspicion (as stated in the post) must be raised that the reservoir is a product that has a longer shelf life than fresh produce. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/214>.]
