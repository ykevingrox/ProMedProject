WVVA [edited]<http://www.wvva.com/story/32249837/2016/06/17/hepatitis-outbreak-at-raleigh-heart-clinic-widens>The hepatitis outbreak that officials said started with 12 patients at the Raleigh Heart Clinic in Beckley has widened.According to Beckley (WV) attorney Stephen New, his law firm has 60 clients who he believes contracted hepatitis from the clinic. ""The majority of them, if not all, had zero risk factors. They were going there strictly to have a stress test. But for unknown reasons, they contracted hepatitis.""2300 patients of the clinic received letters from the Dept. of Health and Human Resources in March 2016, saying they may have been exposed to hepatitis B, C, and HIV.At the time, health officials said they believed the outbreak was confined to 2 clusters of 12 patients. But after more positive tests following the letters, Health and Human Resources officials announced they were widening the notification pool to anyone who received a stress test at the clinic.Raleigh County Commissioners have also been working to recover some of the costs to the Beckley Raleigh County Health Dept. for testing. In May 2016, commissioners billed the Raleigh Heart Clinic for USD 8607 to cover the cost of equipment. As of Fri 17 Jun 2016, they had still not received a payment.[Byline: Annie Moore]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Associated Press report from March 2016 (<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/03/26/officials-12-cases-hepatitis-linked-to-west-virginia-clinic.html>) stated that officials had investigated at least 12 cases of hepatitis linked to a heart clinic in West Virginia. The infections were linked to injectable medications given during cardiac stress tests at the Raleigh Heart Clinic, local news media outlets reported; 8 patients receiving cardiac stress tests have tested positive for hepatitis C, and 4 others have tested positive for hepatitis B, with no evidence of HIV transmission.The investigation had started in November 2014, after a patient with no risk factors for hepatitis C was diagnosed with the virus. The WV State Health Commissioner Dr. Rahul Gupta had said: ""There are single-use vials. You have a drug in one vial for a patient's one-time use. But we found that it is often used for multiple uses. So that's one way of transmitting it, because you can change the needle, but there's always a risk with the vial.""The number of those infected appears, on additional screening, to have risen to 60, but a timeline of when the cardiac stress test was done in these infected people is not shown. A breakdown of HBV and HCV numbers is also not given. Certainly, the reuse of single dose vials is an infection prevention nightmare. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/249>.]
