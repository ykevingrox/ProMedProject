According to medical and police sources in this country the disease is unknown. The suspected [cow] was being treated in a cow pasture at Rushangi-Burambo, the police said. The consumption of this meat has already resulted in the death of a person in KAUSA, reports the customary chief Bashali-Kaembe.The veterinarian who treated the sick cow would have, unsuccessfully, prohibited the residents to eat its meat.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The information in this report does not allow to get a clear idea about the cause of death and more than 100 cases of illness. The symptoms are not described neither in the cow suspected of being the cause of the incident nor in the affected people. This could, among other infections, be anthrax but more information is needed to support this hypothesis.Masisi is a territory of the province of North Kivu.
