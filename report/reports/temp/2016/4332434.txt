It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, as reported in the above case. Even though small clusters of cases have been reported, including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.Influenza A/H7N9 is an evolving animal virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect repeatedly since 2013 and must be monitored closely for genetic changes that may render it more favorable for human-to-human spread. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/345>.]
