EJInsight [edited]<http://www.ejinsight.com/20160113-three-women-suffer-food-poisoning-after-eating-french-oysters/>3 women suffered food poisoning after eating raw oysters imported from France, Ming Pao Daily reported Wed, 13 Jan 2016, citing the Center for Health Protection (CHP).The trio, all 27 years old, experienced symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever 20-40 hours after eating oysters at Mr. & Mrs. Fox, a restaurant in Quarry Bay on 3 Jan 2016. They each went to hospital, but given their stable condition, did not need to be admitted. After an investigation, the CHP found that the raw oysters involved were harvested in Catch Area 50-04 in France. Oysters from this region have been barred from being imported or sold in Hong Kong.The CHP has notified the French authorities about the import ban. It said it will continue to follow the issue and take further necessary action if needed. The supplier of the batch of oysters is Longino & Cardenal. The company's distributors in Hong Kong said it has no stocks of the oysters at the moment.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The etiology of this small cluster of oyster-associated illness is unclear but could be viral such as norovirus or bacterial such as vibriosis.  Toxin-induced illness such as diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) could also be the etiology here. DSP is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_), and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_) <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20020>.The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins, which also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins. The term diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is sometimes used, but this moderator prefers to use diarrheal shellfish poisoning to avoid any confusion between the almost-homophones diarrhetic and diuretic.DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1-2 days. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.]
