Of interest, the TB/HIV rate is low, about 3% of the cohort are co-infected, with high percentages tested.[South Fly, with a population of 46 407 at the 2000 census, is a district of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea. Its capital is Daru, with a population of 20 524 (2009), on an island that goes by the same name, which is located near the mouth of the Fly River on the western side of the Gulf of Papua, just north of Torres Strait and Far North Queensland, Australia.

Extrapulmonary (EP) sites include lymph nodes, pleura, bones/joints, kidneys, brain, pericardium, meninges, and abdomen. EPTB occurs in about 10-20% of HIV-negative patients with TB, but in HIV-positive, 40 to 80% of HIV-infected people with TB have EPTB (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/Supplement_3/S223.long>). 39% of TB patients in South Fly, Papua New Guinea reportedly have EPTB. However, only 3% of TB patients in South Fly are reported to have HIV-coinfection._Mycobacterium bovis_ infection is also more frequently associated with EPTB, perhaps reflecting the consumption of _M. bovis_-contaminated animal products, such as milk and cheese (<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/3/10-1111_article>). Other risk factors for EPTB include female gender and younger age (<http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/44/Suppl_58/P1443>). It would be interesting to find out why the frequency of EPTB is so high in South Fly. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52261>.]
