We analysed the observed prevalence and intensity of infections and compared these with the relevant results of earlier surveys in Burkina Faso.Findings_S. haematobium_ was detected in 287/3514 school children (adjusted prevalence: 8.76 percent, range across sentinel sites: 0.0-56.3 percent; median: 2.5 percent). The prevalence of _S. haematobium_ infection was higher in the children from the Centre-Est, Est and Sahel regions than in those from Burkina Faso's other 8 regions with sentinel sites (P <0.001). The adjusted arithmetic mean intensity of _S. haematobium_ infection among all children was 6.0 eggs per 10 ml urine. Less than 1 percent of the children in 6 regions had heavy _S. haematobium_ infections -- i.e. at least 50 eggs per 10 ml urine -- but such infections were detected in 8.75 percent (28/320) and 11.56 percent (37/320) of the children from the Centre-Est and Sahel regions, respectively. _Schistosoma mansoni_ was detected in only 2 regions and 43 children -- i.e. 1 (0.31 percent) of the 320 from Centre-Sud and 42 (8.75 percent) of the 480 from Hauts Bassins.Conclusion By mass use of preventive chemotherapy, Burkina Faso may have eliminated schistosomiasis as a public health problem in 8 regions and controlled schistosome-related morbidity in another 3 regions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is impressive that the schistosomiasis control program, SCP, has managed to reduce the prevalence in schoolchildren to 1 percent or less in 8 provinces. The national SCP was initiated in 2004, when baseline data found a point prevalence of 18.4-84.2 percent among all children investigated, depending on the study region. The results show that a determined effort using well-proven technologies -- biannual mass distribution of praziquantel 1st to children and from 2006 also to adults, effectively reduced the disease burden of schistosomiasis. - Mod EP A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/49>.]
