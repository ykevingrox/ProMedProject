On Saturday evening [23 Jul 2016], he was tested positive for RVF.The patient is currently in critical condition and is receiving treatment, NHFPC said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley[Although ProMED-mail has not posted cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in humans or in animals in Angola, it is not surprising that the virus is found there. RVF is endemic across wide areas of sub-Sahara Africa from Mauritania and Sudan to South Africa. There have been outbreaks in Egypt and Saudi Arabia as well.There is no indication of the circumstances under which the man acquired his infection.Farm animals are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus. RVF outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. Animal handlers and veterinarians are at particular risk for RVF virus infections. RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.As Mod.AB noted: ""Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_."" - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.]
