Shanghai Daily [edited]<http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=325268>A 10-member Chinese medical team started epidemic research and vaccinated over 120 Chinese nationals working in Angola as part of the bilateral cooperation between the 2 countries to combat an ongoing outbreak of yellow fever in the African country.The team, sent by China's State General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine, conducted physical checks over 200 Chinese in the clinic under the Group 14 of the China's Railway Construction Company in southern Luanda and diagnosed one Chinese woman as a new victim of yellow fever which had killed at least 8 Chinese working in the African country.The team was expected to vaccinate Chinese against yellow fever and conduct education and prevention campaigns for Chinese companies working in Angola, and to carry out epidemic studies and evaluation of the impact of the disease in the country, said Jin Xia, a leading epidemic expert in the team.At least 189 Angolans, in the capital city of Luanda alone, were killed by yellow fever, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, since the 1st cases were reported in Luanda since the end of 2015. The disease is highly preventable by vaccination.The Angolan government has ordered some 5.7 million doses of vaccine and vaccinated over 75 percent of the population in Luanda against yellow fever, while vaccination campaigns were conducted in other provinces, according to local press reports.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Yellow fever cases and deaths in Angola continue to increase. A 29 Mar 2016 report stated that there are now 1311 cases with 185 deaths <http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4739261&Itemid=1>.   An earlier news report claimed WHO said 250 deaths: ProMED archive (21) below but it does not appear on the WHO website.It is good to see Chinese medical teams vaccinating Chinese workers in Angola. However, there is no indication of how many Chinese workers are in that country. Of these, how many are in areas of the country where yellow fever virus is being transmitted, and what percentage coverage is provided by vaccination of the over 120 vaccinees reported?Earlier reports indicated that there were over 20 000 Chinese workers in Angola. This situation illustrates the importance of vaccination of individuals going into endemic yellow fever areas such as Angola before they travel. Companies employing workers sent abroad have the responsibility to see that their employees are adequately vaccinated and informed of health risks that should be avoided. Not only do these measures protect the workers while away, they protect against infected workers traveling home with pathogens such as yellow fever virus and initiating an outbreak.The dengue fever season is fast approaching in southern China, bringing with it the risk of ongoing yellow fever virus transmission initiated by infected returning travelers, since these viruses are transmitted by the same vector mosquito.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map for Angola can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY/JW]
