The deceased has been identified as a boy in the Badali village in Korukonda. Earlier in the morning a 5-year-old boy died at Malkangiri district HQ hospital. Health Minister Pradeep Amat and Secretary Arti Ahuja on Thursday [27 Oct 2016] visited some villages in Malkangiri district and took stock of the situation arising out of the deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus there.The district Collector and the CDMO accompanied the Minister and the Secretary on their visit. On the other hand, the JE virus has now been found in pigs of Koraput district [see the report below].While 28 blood samples from 6 blocks in the district were sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Uttar Pradesh, 8 tested positive for the Japanese encephalitis virus which has raised an alarm. The 8 positive cases are from Jeypore, Kotpad and Boipariguda blocks, sources said.Meanwhile, the sources said 3 children were admitted at the Koraput District Headquarters Hospital reportedly due to JE virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the Joint Director of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr Kalpana Baruah, said the disease has been brought under control and that ""Now there are sporadic cases of the disease. The situation has improved,"" cases continue to slowly mount, increasing from 66 on 26 Oct 2016, now, 3 days later, the fatal case count is 72. Although a previous report indicated that a vaccination campaign was going to be considered in November 2016, no further mention is made in the above report. Bed nets have been distributed, which will provide some protection from mosquito bites. However, immunity from vaccination provides the best barrier to JE virus infection.A 27 Oct 2016 report indicated that the fatal case count is now up to 74 (<http://odishatv.in/odisha/body-slider/encephalitis-claims-two-more-lives-in-malkangiri-toll-74-173519/>).Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]******[2] PigsDate: Thu 27 Oct 2016Source: The Indian Express [edited]<http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/blood-samples-of-pigs-in-koraput-test-positive-for-japanese-encephalitis-virus-3105254/>After tribal-dominated Malkangiri district where a Japanese encephalitis outbreak has claimed 63 lives [now 72 lives], the virus has now been found in pigs of neighbouring Koraput district in Odisha. Of the 28 blood samples sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, 8 samples tested positive for the JE virus, according to the report received by the Koraput district administration yesterday [26 Oct 2016].Officials said of the 8 positive cases, 2 are from Jayanagar in Jeypore, 2 from Ghotorla village in Kotpad block and 3 in Kadalipadar village and one from Chipakur village under Boipariguda block.""In the 2nd phase, we have sent blood samples of 79 pigs to Bareilly and its report are yet to be received. Also, 40 more blood samples will be sent for laboratory tests,"" Sub-Divisional Veterinary Officer (Koraput), S K Takri, said.Awareness drive against the vector-borne disease has already started in the district and JE affected pigs are being kept 3 kilometres [1.9 miles] away from the villages in special enclosures, the officer said.The deadly disease which originates in pigs gets transmitted to humans, particularly children, through mosquitoes, officials said. The disease has so far claimed at least 63 lives in Malkangiri district where 6 out of 7 blocks have been affected by the disease, they said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promedmail.org>[This report does not indicate if the pig samples were positive for presence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus or for antibodies to the virus, which seems more likely. The statement that the virus originates in pigs is only partially correct. Pigs are amplifying hosts for JE virus, but the reservoirs are birds, especially herons. Moving the pigs away from the villages is a prudent way to provide some distance between the amplifying hosts and humans in the villages. - Mod.TY][ ]
