Hartford (CT) Courant [edited]<http://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-ecoli-lebanon-0325-20160324-story.html>The [Connecticut] state's Department of Public Health [DPH] [has been] investigating an outbreak of 7 cases of _Escherichia coli_ [infection] that may have originated from a local [goat] farm. Officials said on Thu 24 Mar 2016, that 6 of the 7 patients had visited the Oak Leaf Dairy Farm, [in Lebanon, CT - Mod.LL] and as a precaution the farm is not allowing people to visit the animals. The 7 patients are between 2 and 25 years old, according to the DPH.""Earlier today [24 Mar 2016], DPH was informed of several patients from southeastern Connecticut who have become ill with _E. coli_,"" said DPH commissioner Raul Pino in a statement. ""We are closely monitoring the situation and working with our partners at the CDC and other relevant stakeholders. We will continue to work diligently to provide the public with the information it needs as we investigate.""In addition the DPH was notified of 2 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which affects the kidneys and the blood's ability to clot, officials said. It can develop in patients who have contracted [certain strains of] _E. coli_.""We strongly encourage anyone who visited the farm in March 2016 and developed symptoms of this illness to contact their physician,"" Pino said. DPH was working with the CDC, as well as a local health district and the state's Department of Agriculture, to figure out how these 7 people got sick.A call to the farm Oak Leaf Dairy Farm was not immediately returned.[byline: Nicholas Rondinone]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although not specifically stated, a presumed animal reservoir and cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome make this outbreak most probably due to an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either the prototypic serotype O157:O7 or otherwise. Cattle are the commonest reservoir implicated -- most commonly via ingestion of undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized dairy products, or manure contaminated produce, or direct contact with a contaminated environment. Other bovine species (including bison, water buffalo, and yak), however, and other ungulates such as goats, sheep, and deer can harbor the organisms and be associated with human disease (ref: Lutwick LI.
