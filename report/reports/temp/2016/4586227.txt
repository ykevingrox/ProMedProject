Food Safety News [edited]<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/10/eu-members-say-salmonella-outbreak-linked-to-polish-eggs/#.WBC0CmeV_cs>It's unclear how many members of the European Union received eggs from Poland that have been implicated in an ongoing salmonellosis outbreak that began in July 2015 and has sickened almost 150 people.Belgium, France, and Germany received some of the eggs, according to information filed with the European Commission's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). As many as 10 countries may have received the eggs, according to reports from Radio Poland.Croatia and the Netherlands filed official notifications last week [week of 17 Oct 2016] with RASFF. Chicken eggs from Poland were sampled [12 Oct 2016] for _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis and the eggs have been withdrawn from the market in Croatia, according to its notification. After testing a large number of eggs, Croatian health authorities have not isolated salmonella in any samples taken, according to the country's agriculture officials.""Following the official information provided by the Health Ministry about a case of food poisoning caused by _Salmonella_ believed to have come from eggs and a notification received through the EU RASFF food and safety alerts system about a possible salmonellosis outbreak in several member states, Minister Tomislav Tolusic, acting in agreement with the Health Minister, is notifying the public that eggs originating from Poland are being recalled from the market,"" the Croatian Agriculture Ministry said in a news release.The European Commission set up a meeting with representatives from several EU countries to discuss the situation. The Polish Agricultural Ministry reported the eggs had been sent to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Croatia, according to Radio Poland. Although distribution details remain unclear, Belgium officials reported the eggs did not go to retailers.However, [according to] the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain in Belgium, ""several shipments of Polish eggs contaminated with _Salmonella_"" were distributed to 7 EU countries, including hundreds of restaurants in Belgium, from ""various Dutch suppliers.""Health, agriculture, and food safety officials in 6 EU countries have been watching the _Salmonella_ outbreak since July 2015. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) thought the outbreak was over early in 2016, but a surge of new cases that began in April 2016 refocused attention, with the case count estimated at 150 in recent weeks. Amidst the ongoing outbreak, the ECDC reported in August 2016 that salmonellosis declined from 2006 through 2010.""There was an 8.8 percent reduction in the number of confirmed cases between 2009 (with) 108 618 confirmed cases and 2010 (with) 99 020 confirmed cases. This decline has been attributed to the successful implementation of _Salmonella_ control programs in poultry populations,"" according to the August 2016 report.That good news is tempered this week [by a] publication of research in the European journal on infectious diseases, Eurosurveillance, that while control measures have been somewhat successful they have not addressed all laying hens whose eggs are produced for sale.""Despite the overall decrease in outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infection in the EU, surveillance data since 1991 in Poland have shown that egg products play a pivotal role in the occurrence of salmonellosis outbreaks in humans, with 63 percent of the outbreaks between 2005 and 2010 being linked to this source,"" according to the research abstract.""The most striking increase has been in the proportion of outbreaks due to _S._ Enteritidis infection linked with the consumption of home-produced eggs: surveillance data show an increase from 76 percent of all _S._ Enteritidis outbreaks in 2004 to 82 percent in 2010.""

The trade should also stop using or selling the products concerned immediately should they still possess them.""The CFS has learned that a batch of eggs produced in Poland with the marking code '3PL30221321' might have been contaminated with _Salmonella_ under the routine Food Incident Surveillance System. Our investigation revealed that 2 Hong Kong importers, Yee Tai Trading Company and Winbo Trading International Company Limited, had imported in different batches a total of 4730 cartons and 961 cartons of the affected eggs from Poland respectively.The affected batches of product all have the marking code '3PL30221321' with expiry dates of 2 Nov 2016, 8 Nov 2016, 9 Nov 2016, 16 Nov 2016, 23 Nov 2016, and 30 Nov 2016. The CFS has contacted the 2 importers. According to the information provided by them, they have no remaining stock of the affected eggs and the products have been sold to wholesalers. The CFS has instructed the 2 importers to initiate a recall of the affected products. For enquiries about the recall, members of the public may call Yee Tai Trading Company at 2547 5274 and Winbo Trading International Company Limited at 2271 4862 during office hours. Besides, the CFS is also tracing the distribution of the affected products,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.The spokesman said that the CFS had contacted the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the European Commission over the incident and would alert the trade to stop using or selling the affected products immediately should they possess them.Eggs should be thoroughly cooked until the yolk and white are firm. Consumers should choose pasteurized eggs or egg products or dried egg powder to prepare dishes not requiring heat treatment. He urged members of the public to stop consuming the affected products if they have purchased any, and to seek medical advice if they feel sick upon consumption.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Serotype Enteritidis is often associated with undercooked eggs or egg products. Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. However, most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and are contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell is formed. - Mod.LL]
