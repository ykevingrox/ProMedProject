Brown Sr., with the help of Save the Children International, orphans and children who have lost a parent are provided services which help them recover from the lack of parenting, schooling and care as a result of the EVD outbreak. As of 4 Apr 2016, the total number of deaths of Liberians is 4810.Mr. Brown also said the charity has provided improvement in the children's well-being, and has sent some of the children to school. Some of these children are benefiting from a pending back-to-school program this year [2016]. He also said that the provided assistance includes food and non-food items, such as school materials, to keep the children in school. Mr. Brown has been working with the Ministry of Health to ensure the children are in school and their health is addressed.]Vaccine-------1 Sep 2016: STRIVE: Sierra Leone trial to introduce a vaccine against Ebola<http://www.ehealthafrica.org/latest/2016/9/1/strive-sierra-leone-trial-to-introduce-a-vaccine-against-ebola>[In 2014, eHealth Africa was approached by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist in the implementation of the 1st clinical trial in Sierra Leone. This trial was to test the efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola virus disease [EVD]. At the time, Sierra Leone was facing a nationwide [EVD] outbreak. Combined with cases in neighboring Liberia and Guinea, the epidemic had already become the worst in recorded history. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international public health emergency, and Sierra Leone declared a national state of emergency. In a health care system already lacking adequate staffing, health-care workers and front-line workers were at extreme risk for contracting the disease.In partnership with the CDC, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) and clinical leadership from the College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (COMAHS), eHealth Africa led the operations for the Sierra Leone trial to introduce a vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE). STRIVE enrolled and vaccinated over 8000 health-care and front-line workers. Over 350 Sierra Leonean clinicians were trained to enroll, vaccinate, and provide surveillance, and also build a functioning cold chain to support -80 degree centigrade temperatures to keep the vaccine viable.Some of the innovations eHealth Africa facilitated for the STRIVE program include a mobile electronic participant registration system, a toll-free line hosted by a 24-hour call center for participants enrolled in the trial, operational and logistical support to the 7 enrollment and vaccination sites, renovation of the enrollment and vaccination sites prior to opening, and contract creation with hospitals around the country to provide free medical care to 8000+ enrolled participants for the duration of the trial.]4 Sep 2016 (Guinea): The story of the Canadian vaccine that beat back Ebola<http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-story-of-the-canadian-vaccine-that-beat-back-ebola>[See story of an individual who was vaccinated and a video of citizen reporter Elizabeth Payne who travelled to Guinea to research the impact of the Canadian-developed Ebola vaccine, VSV-EBOV.

The Ebola clinical trials: a precedent for research ethics in disasters. Journal of Medical Ethics. Peer-reviewed article. doi:10.1136/medethics-2016-103474.Abstract.The West African Ebola epidemic has set in motion a collective endeavor to conduct accelerated clinical trials, testing unproven but potentially lifesaving interventions in the course of a major public health crisis. This unprecedented effort was supported by the recommendations of an ad hoc ethics panel convened in August 2014 by the WHO. By considering why and on what conditions the exceptional circumstances of the Ebola epidemic justified the use of unproven interventions, the panel's recommendations have challenged conventional thinking about therapeutic development and clinical research ethics. At the same time, unanswered ethical questions have emerged, in particular: (i) the specification of exceptional circumstances, (ii) the specification of unproven interventions, (iii) the goals of interventional research in terms of individual versus collective interests, (iv) the place of adaptive trial designs and (v) the exact meaning of compassionate use with unapproved interventions. Examination of these questions, in parallel with empirical data from research sites, will help build pragmatic foundations for disaster research ethics. Furthermore, the Ebola clinical trials signal an evolution in the current paradigms of therapeutic research, beyond the case of epidemic emergencies.] 31 Aug 2016: Liberian malaria cases declined following mass drug administration during Ebola outbreak<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-08-liberian-malaria-cases-declined-mass.html>[Mass drug administration may have reduced malarial incidence during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia, according to a study:Citation.Kuehne A, Tiffany A, Lasry E, et al.

PLoS ONE 11(8): e0161311 . <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161311> Background----------In October 2014, during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia healthcare services were limited while malaria transmission continued. MÌ©decins Sans FrontiÌ¬res (MSF) implemented a mass drug administration (MDA) of malaria chemoprevention (CP) in Monrovia to reduce malaria-associated morbidity. In order to inform future interventions, we described the scale of the MDA, evaluated its acceptance and estimated the effectiveness.Conclusions----------The reduction in self-reported fever cases following the intervention [artesunate/amodiaquine] suggests that MDAs [mass drug administrations] may be effective in reducing cases of fever during Ebola outbreaks. Despite high coverage, initiation of ASAQ-CP [artesunate/ amodiaquine chemoprevention] was low. Combining MDAs with longer term interventions to prevent malaria and to improve access to healthcare may reduce both the incidence of malaria and the proportion of respondents saving their treatment for future malaria episodes.]31 Aug 2016: Ebola stayed in semen of man for 565 days, raising new concerns <http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/nationworld/ct-ebola-man-semen-20160831-story.html>[Researchers initially thought once people survived Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] they were immune and could no longer get sick and transmit the virus to others, as is the case with many other infectious diseases, such as chickenpox.One of the biggest mysteries about Ebola has been about viral persistence and how long fragments can remain in bodily fluids, such as breast milk, saliva, urine and semen. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] warned late Tuesday [30 Aug 2016] that Ebola lingers in semen much longer than previously believed, underscoring how much we still don't understand about the virus. The issue is one of the most critical in the aftermath of the EVD epidemic.The report out Tuesday [30 Aug 2016] in the Lancet Global Health journal finds even that was a low estimate. The study, the largest to date to look at Ebola virus persistence in men who survived infection, comes from a Liberian public health program run in coordination with the World Health Organization [WHO] and the CDC, involving data collected between July 2015 and May [2015]. It shows that of the 429 men who were tested, 9 percent, or 38 Ebola survivors, had fragments of the Ebola virus in their semen.Of the 38, 63 percent had semen samples that tested positive for Ebola one year later. One man was found to still carry Ebola a shocking 565 days after he recovered from illness: a full year and 200 days.An intriguing finding in the study, raising more questions than it answers, is men who were older than 40 were more likely to have a semen sample test positive. The researchers were not able to explain why this may be the case.Citation.Soka MJ, Choi MJ, Baller A, et al. (EPUB 31 Aug 2016).

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). doi: 10.1093/cid/ciw601.Abstract. We report on an Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivor who showed Ebola virus (EBOV) in seminal fluid 531 days after onset of disease. The persisting virus was sexually transmitted in February 2016, about 470 days after onset of symptoms, and caused a new cluster of EVD in Guinea and Liberia. ...more... we provide evidence that the persisting virus remains viable and infectious during the long-term persistence. Evidence for sexual transmission of the persisting EBOV in February 2016, about 470 days after onset of symptoms in the survivor, is compelling. The absence of other cases in Guinea around this time, the epidemiological link between the survivor and case 1, and the identity of strains in the survivor's seminal fluid and the acute cases strongly argue for the survivor being the source of the new infections. ...moreThe reduced evolutionary rate of the virus during persistence is plausible, given the presumed low level of replication in immune privileged sites such as the testes in the absence of detectable viremia. The few mutations that accumulated during the 500 days are of interest and deserve further functional investigation. Nevertheless, the data presented here indicate that this strain retained its pathogenic properties during persistence, as evidenced by transmissibility, replication capacity (Ct values around 20 in the acute cases of the cluster), and fatality ratio of 80%.][This is very concerning since it exacerbates control efforts. - Mod LK][Submitted by Rapporteur Mary Marshall]2 Sep 2016: New model could help improve prediction of outbreaks of Ebola and Lassa fever <http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-09/uoc-nmc090216.php>[Potential outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola and Lassa fever may be more accurately predicted thanks to a new mathematical model developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge. This could in turn help inform public health messages to prevent outbreaks spreading more widely.Citation.Iacono GL, Cunningham AA, Fichet-Calvet E, et al. (2 Sep 2016). A unified framework for the infection dynamics of zoonotic spillover and spread. PLOS NTD. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004957Abstract.A considerable amount of disease is transmitted from animals to humans and many of these zoonoses are neglected tropical diseases. As outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza and Ebola have demonstrated, however, zoonotic diseases are serious threats to global public health and are not just problems confined to remote regions. There are 2 fundamental, and poorly studied, stages of zoonotic disease emergence: 'spillover', i.e. transmission of pathogens from animals to humans, and 'stuttering transmission', i.e. when limited human-to-human infections occur, leading to self-limiting chains of transmission. We developed a transparent, theoretical framework, based on a generalization of Poisson processes with memory of past human infections, that unifies these stages. Once we have quantified pathogen dynamics in the reservoir, with some knowledge of the mechanism of contact, the approach provides a tool to estimate the likelihood of spillover events. Comparisons with independent agent-based models demonstrate the ability of the framework to correctly estimate the relative contributions of human-to-human vs animal transmission. As an illustrative example, we applied our model to Lassa fever, a rodent-borne, viral hemorrhagic disease common in West Africa, for which data on human outbreaks were available. The approach developed here is general and applicable to a range of zoonoses. This kind of methodology is of crucial importance for the scientific, medical and public health communities working at the interface between animal and human diseases to assess the risk associated with the disease and to plan intervention and appropriate control measures. The Lassa case study revealed important knowledge gaps, and opportunities, arising from limited knowledge of the temporal patterns in reporting, abundance of and infection prevalence in, the host reservoir.]3 Sep 2016: Virus genomes reveal the factors that spread and sustained the West African Ebola epidemic.<http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/02/071779>[Citation.Dudas G, Carvalho LM, Bedford T, et al. (EPUB 2 Sep 2916; preprint, not peer-reviewed). Virus genomes reveal the factors that spread and sustained the West African Ebola epidemic BIORxV. doi: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/071779>Abstract.The 2013-2016 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in West Africa was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Extensive collaborative sequencing projects have produced a large collection of over 1600 Ebola virus genomes, representing over 5 percent of known cases, unmatched for any single human epidemic. In this comprehensive analysis of this entire dataset, we reconstruct in detail the history of migration, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region. We test the association of geography, climate, administrative boundaries, demography and culture with viral movement among 56 administrative regions. Our results show that during the outbreak viral lineages moved according to a classic 'gravity' model, with more intense migration between larger and more proximate population centers. Notably, we find that despite a strong attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, localized cross-border transmission beforehand had already set the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures relatively ineffective in curbing the epidemic. We use this empirical evidence to address why the epidemic did not spread into neighboring countries, showing that although these regions were susceptible to developing significant outbreaks, they were also at lower risk of viral introductions. Finally, viral genome sequence data uniquely reveals this large epidemic to be a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help inform approaches to intervention in such epidemics in the future.][Highly recommended reading providing insight into Ebola spread. - Mod LK][Submitted by Rapporteur Mary Marshall][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at: <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png> - Mod.LKHealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54> Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>][See Also:Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.3908196].................................................lk/msp/dk"
