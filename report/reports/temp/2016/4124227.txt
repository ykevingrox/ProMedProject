GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology Network) [edited]<http://www.gideononline.com>Re: ProMED-mail Lyme disease - Finland: underreporting 20160328.4122126----------------------------------------------------------------------A recent report on ProMED-mail that Lyme disease is an under-reported disease in Finland is disturbing. Officially-reported rates have been increasing rapidly since the year 2000, and already exceed those of the United States by more than 300 percent! [1,2].

Gideon e-books, <http://www.gideononline.com/ebooks/country/infectious-diseases-of-finland/>.--Communicated by:Dr Steve BergerGeographic MedicineTel Aviv Medical CenterIsrael<mberger@post.tau.ac.il>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for his continued contributions.The reported incidence for confirmed Lyme disease in the US for 2014, the most recent year for which data are available, is 25 359 (incidence rate 7.9 per 100 000) (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>). The reported incidence for Lyme disease given in the news report for Finland in 2015 is 1900 (about 35 per 100 000); this incidence rate in Finland is over 4-fold higher than the reported US incidence rate, as Dr Berger points out.However, the CDC estimates that the total number of people who develop Lyme disease each year in the US is actually 10 times higher than the yearly reported number or 253 590 (79 per 100 000) for 2014 (<http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html>). The news report says that one estimate for the actual number of Lyme cases in Finland in 2015 is 4000-5000 (74-93 per 100 000) and another estimate is 8000 (148 per 100 000), that is, the estimates for the actual yearly incidence rate of Lyme cases in Finland may be up to almost 2-fold higher than the estimate for the actual incidence rate of Lyme cases in the US. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/118>.]
