Colouenos Aires [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.colonbuenosaires.com.ar/semanariocolondoce/cgi-bin/hoy/archivo/2016/00000453.html>The death of a 35-year-old man from [a] hantavirus [infection] is generating worry in the Junin area of Buenos Aires [province]. There is an attempt to determine whether the victim contracted the disease in this city or whether it happened on one of his trips, because he worked as a truck driver.Tests done at the Instituto Maiztegui in Pergamino finally confirmed that the man died of [a] hantavirus [infection] and not of dengue, as was believed earlier, according to the local newspaper La Verdad.This information was confirmed by the head of the Intensive Care Unit of the Junin Hospital, Carlos Rodriguez, who said that the case could have been locally acquired.The 35-year-old man had been admitted to the hospital with a severe clinical picture of respiratory insufficiency, and he was sent immediately to the intensive care unit, where he finally died on Tuesday [10 May 2016]. In the beginning, it was thought that he might have been a dengue case, since the symptoms are similar, but thanks to the tests, he was finally confirmed as [a] hantavirus [infection] case.It is worth noting that this week a report was issued on the death of a 12-year-old girl from [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Azul locality of Buenos Aires [province], which caused the local health authorities to proceed with rodent control in the school where it occurred, although the acquisition of the infection in the facility was discarded (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160513.4220892).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There is no indication of the specific hantavirus involved in this case or the previous one of the 12-year-old girl.There were 3 previous fatal cases of a hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province last year (2015). There were several cases of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province during 2014, 3 of which were fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The hantaviruses involved in the report above and in the previous cases are not identified, and ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus has been laboratory identified.Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 4 years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these recent Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at <http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg>.A map of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.argentina.org.au/images/mapa-politico-argentina.jpg>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/723>.]
