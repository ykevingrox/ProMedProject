He was hospitalized on 13 Sep 2016.The hospital initially concluded he died of illness. But the police decided to conduct an autopsy on his body after NY was found to have died of poisoning last week. The 2 patients had been confined to their beds and medical drips including a nutrition supplement had been administered.The police are examining the inside of some of the drip bags attached to SN, although no holes were found, according to the sources.The police have detected a surfactant compound in one of the drip bags attached to NY that is of the same composition as that contained in disinfectant stored at the nurses' station on the 4th floor.--Communicated by:Karyn Bishoff<klb72@cornell.edu>[To find this many holes in the rubber stopper of the bags looks very deliberate. The next question is who had access to the closet of cleaning supplies as well as access to the patient IV fluids?The article does not tell us what kind of surfactant was found. Surfactant has a very broad definition. Surfactants are compounds capable of lowering the surface tension between liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. Soap can function as a surfactant. There are so many compounds or combinations of compounds in a cleaning closet that it would be impossible to speculate on which one or ones could have been added to a bag of fluids.We hope a full investigation will provide illumination into what the surfactant was as well as catching the perpetrator. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.].................................................tg/msp/dk"
