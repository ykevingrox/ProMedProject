Daily Mail [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3608637/Queensland-syphilis-outbreak-causes-death-three-children-167-infected.html>So far, 3 Aboriginal children have died from congenital syphilis in Queensland's worst outbreak in 30 years. Since 2015, 167 new cases of congenital syphilis have been diagnosed in North Queensland, prompting health minister Cameron Dick to announce on [Wed 25 May 2016] a 5 year AUD 5.7 million [about USD 4.1 million] plan to tackle the sexually transmitted disease, according to The Brisbane Times.Congenital syphilis infects babies when a pregnant woman contracts the disease and passes it along to her child. It can be treated with penicillin if diagnosed early.The North Queensland's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Sexually Transmissible Infections Action Plan will disperse 8 new specialists to North Queensland to increase the amount of regular sexual health screenings. Sexual health education will also be administered in remote areas such as Doomadgee and Kowanyama.Mr Dick said that he hopes the plan will stabilise the outbreak within 5 years but the Queensland government has given themselves 18 months to stop the increase in cases. 'This is an unacceptable situation and we need to ensure health services are working with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their communities,' Mr Dick said.The plan predicts that some children will continue to die from congenital syphilis will continue until December 2017.[byline: Brianne Tolj]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There are several different on-going syphilis outbreaks in Queensland, Australia.One outbreak involves men who have sex with men (MSM) in the city of Brisbane in south eastern Queensland (see ProMED-mail. Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) MSM, indigenous 20151115.3792153).Another outbreak involves indigenous people, complicated by congenital infection, in remote communities in north western Queensland that ProMED-mail first reported in 2012, which spread to the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region in the north eastern part of Western Australia (see ProMED-mail posts: Syphilis - Australia (04): (QL) MSM, bisexual, indigenous, RFI 20151213.3856016; Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) MSM, indigenous 20151115.3792153; Syphilis - Australia (02): (NT,WA) increase, indigenous, congenital, fatal 20151102.3760394; Syphilis - Australia: (NT) increased incidence, indigenous people, RFI 20150713.3507530; Syphilis - Australia (02): (QL) RFI 20141204.3011086; and Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) indigenous, RFI 20120808.1234631).Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people (Indigenous Australians) make up about 30 per cent of the population in the Northern Territory, 4.2 per cent of the population in Queensland, and 3.75 per cent of the population in Western Australia. 70 per cent of the Indigenous population live outside major cities, of which about a third live in remote communities, where access to health services is likely to be poor (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians>): ""Only 20 per cent of Aboriginal people who live in remote communities of more than 50 people have access to a doctor on a daily basis according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures from 2006.
