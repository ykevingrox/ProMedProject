It is the 3rd case doctors have diagnosed in the past week.""It is important that anyone travelling to areas prone to measles including Southeast Asia is certain that they have received the 2-dose measles vaccination,"" SA Health's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Paddy Phillips, said in a statement.""Measles is highly contagious among people who are not fully immunised, and is spread through coughing and sneezing. The illness begins with fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes, followed by a blotchy rash, which begins on the head and then spreads down the body.""If anyone suspects they may be ill, Professor Phillips is urging them to contact their GP ahead prior to scheduling an appointment.""It is very important that people phone their GP ahead of any visit and mention why they are attending so that precautions can be taken to avoid spreading disease to others,"" Professor Phillips said. ""Immunisation provides the best protection against measles, and it's vital that everyone makes sure they've had 2 doses of the measles vaccine to protect themselves and the community.""There have been 5 cases of measles in South Australia so far this year [2016].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>A HealthMap of Australia can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/286> - Mod.LK]******[2] Australia (South Australia) local transmissionDate: 21 Sep 2016Source: 9 News [edited]<http://www.9news.com.au/health/2016/09/21/17/49/two-more-cases-of-measles-diagnosed-in-south-australia>Another 2 cases of measles have been diagnosed in South Australia, with a woman and a baby boy contracting the disease through the local community.SA Health's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Paddy Phillips, said the 22-year-old woman and 9-month-old boy were in a stable condition in hospital.""We have identified that the 2 latest cases of measles were contracted locally, most likely after being in the same location as one of the previously notified cases,"" Prof. Phillips said.People who believe they have the symptoms should contact their doctor before visiting to minimise the spread of the disease.Those who were at the locations [listed in the URL above] at the times listed should be alert for symptoms and contact their doctor if they are feeling unwell.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Japan: insufficient vaccine stockDate: 21 Sep 2016Source: The Asahi Shimbun [edited]<http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201609210056.html>Measles is rapidly spreading in Japan, with 115 confirmed cases this year [2016] so far, but the nation appears to hold insufficient stocks of an immunization vaccine for everyone who needs it.""Some experts and medical organizations are complaining that there is not enough vaccine,"" said members of an expert panel at the health ministry. The nation's measles vaccination program should be given top priority, the panel members added.Of the 115 cases confirmed this year by 11 Sep [2016], 96 of those occurred within the last 4 weeks, according to preliminary figures released on 20 Sep 2016 by the Tokyo-based National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). That compares to just 35 cases of measles recorded in Japan in 2015.The current outbreak of the infection gathered pace at Kansai International Airport, Osaka Prefecture, where it spread among workers from mid-August [2016]. Many of those infected work at counters for international flights.According to the NIID, Osaka Prefecture currently has the highest number of cases at 43, followed by Hyogo and Chiba prefectures with 21 each and Tokyo with 11. The confirmed cases are mainly among babies, toddlers and children. 90 percent of those infected are under 40 years old.Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by an airborne virus. The vaccination shot is effective in preventing its spread.[Byline: Yusuke Ogawa]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Japan can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/cities_of_japan_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.The pending shortage of vaccine may be due to the offer of free vaccination to 900 workers at Kansai International Airport; see: Measles update (46): Japan (OS) Kansai airport 20160909.4478118.The common theme running through all the measles outbreak reports is the importance of vaccination. Two doses are required for protection. After one dose of measles vaccine, 85 per cent of children 9 months of age and 95 per cent over 12 months of age are immune. Nearly all of those who do not develop immunity after a single dose develop it after a 2nd dose. - Mod.LK]
