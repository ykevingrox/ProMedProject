The district says students who attend class or rode the bus with the affected student will be getting a letter from the Tulsa Health Department offering a free tuberculosis test [tuberculin skin test or interferon gold?].Parents are advised if their child does not receive a letter, a test will not be necessary. Jenks Public Schools stresses the risk of other students getting tuberculosis is extremely low, adding that the disease can only be transmitted through close, prolonged contact.Earlier this month [November 2016], a Jenks High School student was diagnosed with the disease.--Communicated by:Morgan MuellerOUHSC<Cuevas.morgan@gmail.com>******[2]Date: Fri 11 Nov 2016Source: Newson6 [edited]<http://m.newson6.com/story/33686476/no-evidence-of-tuberculosis-exposure-in-jenks-schools>Jenks Public School officials say they have no evidence of exposure to tuberculosis in classrooms or on the district's school buses. This comes after a high school student was diagnosed with the disease earlier this month [November 2016].School officials say several students did have a positive [tuberculin] skin test, but state health officials say they believe they were likely false positives.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Mon 7 Nov 2016.Source: Newson6 [edited]<http://m.newson6.com/story/33649536/free-tb-tests-offered-after-jenks-student-diagnosed-with-tuberculosis>Jenks High School and the Tulsa Health Department are planning free tuberculosis testing for some students who they think may have come in contact with a student diagnosed with TB.The Health Department confirmed with the district Monday [7 Nov 2016] morning that one high school student tested positive. The high school student has missed the last 3 weeks of class, and the health department says recovery can take at least 6 months.Rob Loeber with Jenks High School said that since learning about the student with tuberculosis, the school has been in touch with the teen's family. ""We know that the student is okay and hopefully can return to school as quickly as possible,"" he said.The Tulsa Health Department says the risk of tuberculosis spreading to anyone at the school is ""extremely low,"" but the infection is serious. Tulsa City-County Health Department [THD] Donna Durant-Macon with THD said: ""Left untreated, it can lead to death.""Durant-Macon manages the tuberculosis program with the health department and said anyone who has had close, repeated contact with the affected student needs to take their health seriously. Students who rode the bus or went to class with the affected student are being contacted by the Tulsa Health Department and are encouraged to get tested for TB. ""If the test is positive, then we will offer chest X-rays here at the Tulsa Health Department, and there's no charge for those,"" Duran-Macon said.The health department said that so far this year [2016], there have been 61 cases of tuberculosis statewide. Last year [2015], there were 67 cases, 16 in Tulsa County. But Durant-Macon said that it might be more common than people realize. ""I think statistically, about 1/3rd of the population is infected with the dormant infection,"" she said. She added that in some cases, active tuberculosis can take 18 to 24 months to recover from. ""We wish the student well; we wish the family well,"" Loeber said. ""I know it's a trying thing for kids and families to go through.""Free testing is available Tuesday [8 Nov 2016] at the high school for students who the health department reached out to.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail thanks Morgan Mueller for submission of the news report of an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) in an Oklahoma high school.TB is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. TB exists in 2 forms: latent TB infection (LTBI) and clinically active infection (TB disease). Those with recent exposure to a person with contagious TB (e.g., pulmonary or laryngeal TB with positive sputum smear) should be evaluated immediately for LTBI because of the risk for progression to TB disease. Testing for LTBI is done by either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or a blood test known as an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). If the TST or IGRA result is positive, and there is no evidence of TB disease, they should be treated for LTBI. Those who initially have negative results should be retested in 8-10 weeks after exposure has ended. Medical evaluations for TB disease include a TST or an IGRA, a chest x-ray and physical examination.TST is the preferred method for testing children under the age of 5 years (<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm>) because of limited data on the use of IGRAs in this age group (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf>). TST will detect _M. tuberculosis_ infection as well as prior exposure to BCG vaccine or non-tuberculous mycobacteria. IGRAs, however, are unaffected by BCG and most non-tuberculous, environmental mycobacteria. IGRAs should be used if there is a question of false positive reaction to TST in the exposed Jenks high school students.TB in children, either as LTBI or as TB disease, is an indication of recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_, usually from an adult with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis, who was in close contact with the children, for example, at school, or in the home. Case finding should identify these sources. In addition, in the U.S., TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who have acquired the infection in countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk from _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis Rep 2008, 10(6): 444-6 and Dankner WM, Davis CE: _Mycobacterium bovis_ as a significant cause of tuberculosis in children residing along the United States-Mexico border in the Baja California region. Pediatrics. 2000; 105(6): E79; abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835092>)._M. bovis_ is resistant to the anti-TB drug pyrazinamide (PZA), an essential component of the initial 8-week phase of the 6-month drug treatment regimen for active TB disease. If the initial phase of treatment does not include PZA, treatment must be continued for a total of 9 months, rather than 6 months (<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm>).Tulsa, with a metropolitan area population of about one million residents, is located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma>). The city is the county seat of Tulsa County, the most densely populated county in Oklahoma. Jenks, the location of Jenks High School, is a suburb of Tulsa in Tulsa County. As of the 2010 census, the Jenks population was 16 924. Oklahoma is located in the South Central region of the U.S. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/238>.]
