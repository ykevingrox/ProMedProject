A total of 6 434 316 must be vaccinated in the province of Luanda.The provinces of Benguela, Bie, Cabinda, Cunene, Cuanza Sul, Huambo and Huila also reported cases, all linked to Luanda.Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and causes fever, muscle pain, loss of appetite, vomiting and nausea that can lead to death.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alertsproved@promedmail.org[The vaccination campaign in the Luanda area continues.  On although the numbers of cases reported on 9 Mar 2016 were the same as those reported above, about 2/3 of the population has been vaccinated. ProMED-mail subscriber Stephen Seligman (<sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu>)  commented, ""The attempts to vaccinate the entire population older than 6 months are impressive. The fact that the epicenter is the capital Luanda suggests that this is an outbreak of urban yellow fever and that the vector is _Aedes aegypti_. The hot, rainy season is supposed to last from February to April, but urban yellow fever can occur even in the dry season. Are there any data to corroborate that _Ae. aegypti_ is the vector in the current outbreak and that expected rainy season is present?"" Stephen J. Seligman, M.D.Adjunct Professor, Casanova Lab, St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, The Rockefeller University New York, NY 10065Interestingly, none of the yellow fever reports from Angola mentions efforts to control the vector mosquito. Given the logistical challenges of mounting a major vaccination campaign as quickly as possible, it is not surprising that vaccination is the focus of efforts in Angola.
