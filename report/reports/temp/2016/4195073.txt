Wandsworthsw18 [edited]<http://www.wandsworthsw18.com/shared/conmeasles001.htm>Wandsworth Town Hall has been covered with images of measles spots as public health experts warn that London is in the grip an outbreak of the disease.This week, Public Health England has warned that the capital has seen more than 60 cases of measles in the last 2 months, in a period when there would usually be fewer than 10. Of these, 48 were in people aged 15 and over. In Wandsworth, there have been 3 confirmed cases since February [2016].They are urging people to get vaccinated, stressing that parents and young adults as well as children should get the MMR jab.In Wandsworth, images of measles spots were projected onto the 1930s town hall building on Tue night [26 Apr 2016] to mark the World Health Organization (WHO) European Immunisation Week. Banners promoting the jab will be displayed all week.The aim of the stunt was to communicate the important message that measles can be a serious threat to health. As well as spots, the hashtag #MMR was projected, because the only way to protect yourself and your children against the disease is to get the MMR vaccination. Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England London regional director, came along to support the campaign and spoke about the importance of being innoculated.Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. It is spread through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.It is now less common in the UK because of the effective MMR vaccination programme. Vaccine uptake rates in England are currently among the highest in Europe, but an increase is still needed to reach the WHO's 95 per cent target for MMR vaccination in 2 year olds. The current rate in London is just over 87 per cent.Those who are unvaccinated, or not fully vaccinated, remain susceptible to the disease. The MMR vaccination also provides protection against 2 other common highly infectious diseases: mumps and rubella.The council works with local GPs to ensure that people in Wandsworth receive recommended jabs. The council's public health team is keen to ensure that enough people are vaccinated to prevent an outbreak.If enough people are immunised, they help to protect vulnerable members of their communities by reducing the spread of the disease. If rates fall, so-called ""herd immunity"" can break down, leading to an increase in the number of new cases.People at risk are those that have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine or haven't had the infection before, particularly babies, those with weakened immune systems, or who are pregnant.""Projecting spots onto the town hall may appear to be a light-hearted stunt, but behind it there is a very serious message,"" said Wandsworth's director of public health Houda Al-Sharifi.""Make sure you and your children are fully vaccinated. In some cases, people who contract measles go on to develop pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). It's never too late to get vaccination. Just talk to your GP.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In March 2016, it was noted that measles infections in the UK, many of which resulted in hospital admissions, were predominantly in those aged 14-40. Dr Kevin Brown, deputy director of Public Health England's virus reference department, said: ""The cases we have seen recently have been confirmed mainly in adolescents and young adults. He advocated receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty about vaccination history (<http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/11/sudden-increase-uk-measles-cases-warning-mmr-vaccination>). - Mod.LK]******[2] Measles: USA (TN)Date: Mon 25 Apr 2016Source: Fox 13 [edited]<http://www.fox13memphis.com/news/6-confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-shelby-county-health-officials-in-outbreak-mode/239813109>Just days after confirming 2 cases, the Shelby County Health Department confirmed an additional 4 cases of measles. ""We have received confirmation of 6 cases of measles in Shelby County,"" Dr. Helen Morrow said.Dr. Morrow addressed the public on Mon [25 Apr 2016] during a news conference meant to update the community on the 1st 2 confirmed cases from last week. She also confirmed the 4 new cases and said the department is now in ""outbreak mode. We are having a lot of activity, yes,"" Dr. Morrow said.Dr. Morrow told FOX 13 that the Shelby County Health Department has teamed up with state and national leaders to stop the spread of measles in our area. ""It is very easily transmitted through the air,"" Dr. Morrow explained. The disease can cause fever, a skin rash, and can even end in death in some cases.There is now an effort underway to contact those who have unknowingly been in harm's way, in order to bring an end to the growing problem. ""We may not get to everybody, so I would not be surprised if we do have some more cases,"" Dr. Morrow said. ""But, we are continuing the investigation and outreach.""Health experts said being vaccinated is your best defense against measles.The 6 infected are said to be recovering at home. None of the identities of those affected were released during the conference, but officials did confirm those affected fall into a ""widely diverse age range."" Officials also said they have not determined the source of the 1st case.There have only been 9 confirmed cases of measles in Tennessee over the past 12 years before the outbreak, according to Morrow.Locals with questions concerning measles and vaccines are encouraged to call the measles hotline at 901-222-9299.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The county's cases involve a diverse group of patients in terms of age, gender and place of residence, said Dr. Helen Morrow, the Shelby County Health Department's health officer. All of the patients diagnosed so far in the Memphis area had not had a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, generally administered to children around their 1st birthdays and again before they go to school.Measles, once a rite of childhood with more than 90% of Americans infected by age 15, was eliminated in the United States in 2000, according the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But agency officials note that the disease is still common in some countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Pacific.""The reason we see outbreaks is a larger number of children are being unvaccinated,"" an infectious disease doctor said. ""That population is highly vulnerable because measles is so contagious""(<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/04/27/tennessee-measles-outbreak/83611214/>). - Mod.LKA HealthMap of the United Kingdom may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>.A HealthMap of Tennessee in the USA may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/244>.]
