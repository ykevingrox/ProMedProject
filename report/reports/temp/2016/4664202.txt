CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) News [edited]<http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/nova-scotia/iwk-nova-scotia-health-authority-warning-about-infection-risk-1.3871278>More than 4000 Atlantic Canadians who underwent heart surgery at 2 Halifax [Nova Scotia] hospitals are being warned they may have been exposed to a rare bacterial infection from contaminated medical equipment. The province's 2 health authorities said [Mon 28 Nov 2016] the QEII [Queen Elizabeth II] Health Sciences Centre and the IWK Health Centre have found a link between a device used to heat and cool blood during cardiac surgeries to a bacterial infection caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria or NTM.It's possible the equipment was exposed to the bacteria during manufacturing, the Nova Scotia Health Authority and the IWK Health Centre said in a joint news release. The devices have been used since 2010 at the IWK and since 2012 at the NSHA [Nova Scotia Health Authority]. ""There is a slight possibility that contaminated water contained in these devices has been transferred through the air into operating rooms,"" the release said. There have been no reports of local infections and the risk is ""very low, less than one per cent,"" the release said.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alerted doctors and hospitals to the same issue in mid-October [2016]. American officials linked the contamination to at least 28 cases, including 4 deaths.Other hospitals in Canada have issued similar alerts and hospitals in Montreal diagnosed 2 patients with a related infection in October [2016]. Health Canada says the bacteria are ""typically not harmful"" but can ""cause infections in very ill patients, including those with compromised immune systems, and chronic diseases or health conditions."" After exposure in an operating room, infections may take months or even years to develop.Symptoms may include: unexplained and persistent night sweats; muscle aches; weight loss; fatigue; and fever.The Nova Scotia Health Authority said it has sent a letter to 3746 former patients from Nova Scotia, as well as 296 people from PEI [Prince Edward Island], 20 people from New Brunswick and 5 from Newfoundland and Labrador. The authority said it has also reached out to 11 people in others parts of Canada and 2 people from the UK. The IWK sent letters to 146 people in Nova Scotia, 107 in New Brunswick, 16 in PEI and 51 from Newfoundland and Labrador. 3 patients were from other areas.People with concerns are being asked to call toll-free numbers at the Nova Scotia Health Authority (1-844-874-0122) or the IWK (1-855-495-2273).[byline: Elizabeth McMillan]--communicated by:David Fisman MD MPH FRCPDivision of EpidemiologyDalla Lana School of Public HealthUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5T 3M7Canada<david.fisman@gmail.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Fisman for submitting this report.The outbreak of infections caused by _Mycobacterium chimaera_, an invasive, slow-growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium, linked to heater-cooler devices (HCD) used in cardiac surgery is truly global. Several European countries -- including Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom --, the US and now Canada have reported cases. The risk exists wherever the incriminated HCD, LivaNova PLC (formerly Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH) StÌ¦ckert 3T manufactured prior to September 2014, has been used. This particular HCD is said to have been contaminated with _M. chimaera_ during its manufacture in Germany. The CDC estimates that about 60 per cent of the more than 250 000 heart bypass procedures performed in the US annually utilize the HCD associated with these infections (<https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p1013-contaminated-devices-.html>). Water in HCD circuits does not directly come in contact with the patient, but contaminated water from the HCD can become aerosolized, transmitting bacteria through the device's exhaust vent into the environment and to the patient.The symptoms of _M. chimaera_ infection in patients exposed during open-heart surgery are nonspecific and can often take months to develop. As a result, diagnosis of these infections can be missed or sometimes delayed for years. Patients who had valves or prosthetic products implanted are thought to be at higher risk for these infections. The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued recommendations to help minimize patient risk of infections associated with the HCD (<http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm525147.htm>).For discussions of _Mycobacterium chimaera_ infections associated with heater-cooler devices, please see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail posts: Non-TB mycobacteria - USA (04): nosocomial, heater-coolers, CDC, FDA 20161015.4561053; Non-TB mycobacteria - USA (03): (PA) nosocom, fatal, heater-coolers, more cases 20160927.4517593; and Non-TB mycobacteria - USA (02): (PA) nosocomial, heater-cooler machine 20160923.4511595.Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, is a large teaching hospital affiliated with Dalhousie University that is administratively part of the Nova Scotia Health Authority (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II_Health_Sciences_Centre>). The IWK [Izaac Walton Killam] Hospital is a teaching hospital and research center for disorders and diseases affecting children and women that is also affiliated with Dalhousie University (<http://www.iwk.nshealth.ca/page/about-us>). - Mod.MLIf, as our last posting on the non-TB mycobacteria suggests, this may be a risk worldwide, this is likely to be happening all round the world. While we won't, I'm sure, want to post a blow-by-blow account of all the look-backs, it might be interesting to consider the costs in money, time, and anxiety that will be incurred. - Mod.SHA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5937>.]
