Therefore, we analysed the ability of WNV to infect German _Culex_ mosquitoes with special emphasis on field collected specimens of _Culex torrentium_ and _Culex pipiens_ biotype _pipiens_. We collected egg rafts of _Culex_ mosquitoes over 2 subsequent seasons at 2 geographically distinct sampling areas in Germany and differentiated the samples by molecular methods. Adult females, reared from the various egg rafts, were challenged with WNV by feeding of artificial blood meals. WNV infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and virus titration. The results showed that field collected _C. pipiens_ biotype _pipiens_ and _C. torrentium_ mosquitoes native to Germany are susceptible to WNV infection at 25 C as well as 18 C incubation temperature. _C. torrentium_ mosquitoes, which have not been established as WNV vector so far, were the most permissive species tested with maximum infection rates of 96 percent at 25 C. Furthermore, a disseminating infection was found in up to 94 percent of tested _C. pipiens_ biotype _pipiens_ and 100 percent of _C. torrentium_. Considering geographical variation of susceptibility, _C. pipiens_ biotype _pipiens_ mosquitoes from Southern Germany were more susceptible to WNV infection than corresponding populations from Northern Germany. All in all, we observed high infection and dissemination rates even at a low average ambient temperature of 18 C. The high susceptibility of German _Culex_ populations for WNV indicates that an enzootic transmission cycle in Germany could be possible.--Communicated by:One Health Initiative<http://www.onehealthinitiative.com>[This study provides strong evidence for the potential vector capability of 2 species of _Culex_ mosquitoes in Germany for West Nile virus (WNV). Both mosquitoes were highly susceptible to infection by WNV and the virus disseminated within the mosquitoes. However, the authors pointed out that further transmission studies are needed to clarify their vector competence. It would have been interesting had the capability for WNV transmission been established by the mosquitoes feeding on and infecting a host animal or had the presence of the virus been demonstrated in the mosquitoes' saliva. Those additional experiments are needed to make a convincing case for the vector capacity of these 2 species.ProMED-mail has posted human and equine cases of WNV in countries in southern Europe and northward into Russia, but not in Germany. If these 2 _Culex_ species prove to be efficient vectors, it would not be surprising to find the virus in Germany as well. The virus is transmitted annually in temperate zones in the Americas. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101>.]
