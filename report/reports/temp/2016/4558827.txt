""In addition, FDA's current laboratory results do not indicate the active pharmaceutical ingredient used to manufacture oral liquid docusate is a source of the _B. cepacia_ outbreak.""FDA also said that health care professionals can resume normal use of oral liquid docusate sodium not manufactured by PharmaTech and that it ""reminds manufacturers of the importance of robust manufacturing and testing of liquid products such as docusate sodium to ensure low levels of microorganisms and the absence of those that may cause infection.""The agency added that it will continue to monitor adverse event reports for _B. cepacia_ and that it ""encourages health care professionals and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of oral liquid docusate sodium products to FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program [<http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm>].""[byline: Zachary Brennan][1.
