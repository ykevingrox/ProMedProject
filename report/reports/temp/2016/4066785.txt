The resulting impaired gastro-intestinal motility allows for longer exposure to the toxin. Post-mortem examination shows toxic megacolon or necrotizing enterocolitis. The most likely cause is poor temperature control of pre-prepared foods, especially in institutional settings. Outbreaks have been reported, but potentially individual cases may be unrecognized (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6132a1.htm>, <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18452342>).--Colleen BamfordDivision of Medical MicrobiologyUniversity of Cape TownSouth Africa<colleen.bamford@uct.ac.za>[ProMED thanks Colleen Bamford for her comment. The serotype of the organism in the Nigeria cases was not stated. The 1st citation is:CDC: Fatal Foodborne Clostridium perfringens Illness at a State Psychiatric Hospital -- Louisiana, 2010. MMWR 2012;61:605-608.And the editorial discussion is:""The laboratory results, clinical course, and epidemiologic findings indicate that this outbreak was caused by _C. perfringens_ type A. A related organism, _C. perfringens_ type C, causes clostridial necrotizing enteritis or 'pigbel,' a type of foodborne illness characterized by necrotizing small bowel inflammation caused by the beta toxin. Necrotizing enteritis is caused when the normal trypsin-mediated degradation of beta toxin is impaired by a protein-poor diet or coingestion of foods such as sweet potatoes that contain trypsin inhibitors. Clostridial necrotizing enteritis has a mortality rate of 15-25 percent, but it is rare in developed countries such as the United States (2) and was ruled out in this outbreak when samples tested negative for the beta-toxin gene.""This is the 2nd reported outbreak of foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_ type A with fatalities attributed to necrotizing colitis (3) that occurred in a U.S. psychiatric inpatient facility. In the 1st reported outbreak, which occurred in 2001, 2 of 3 patients who had necrotizing colitis died. Each had experienced a clinical course similar to that found in the 2010 outbreak. In one other report of a foodborne _C. perfringens_ type A outbreak, 2 fatalities occurred in a psychogeriatric hospital in England (4). Evidence of chronic constipation and fecal impaction was found, but necrotizing colitis was not found on postmortem examination (4).""Psychiatric hospital residents exposed to _C. perfringens_ might be at increased risk for developing necrotizing colitis because of impaired gastrointestinal motility from chronic use of anticholinergic medications. All 3 deceased patients in this outbreak were taking medications with anticholinergic side effects: quetiapine, fluphenazine, benztropine, and clozapine. Additionally, one patient was on a constipating diuretic medication, hydrochlorothiazide. Another was given an opiate antimotility agent (loperamide), but did not have necrotizing colitis. These medications delay the usual elimination of enterotoxin by _C. perfringens_-induced diarrhea, causing longer exposure to the toxin. Prolonged exposure to _C. perfringens_ enterotoxin has been shown to cause severe intestinal damage and death in a rabbit model (5).""The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, patient information was obtained from secondary sources: hospital staff members, nursing notes, and emergency department records. These contained approximate measures of onset time, reducing the reliability of incubation time calculation. Second, no records were kept of the quantity of food each patient ate, which prevented a determination of correlation with disease severity.""Why these patients developed fatal necrotizing colitis when many other ill patients who also were taking psychiatric medications with anti-intestinal motility side effects experienced a self-limited illness with full recovery is unclear. The amount of inoculum ingested, the dose of antipsychotic medication administered to patients, and the variation in host susceptibility to anticholinergic side effects might affect disease outcome. The precise mechanism causing death remains in question; one patient who died in the outbreak had no evidence of necrotizing colitis or other abnormality on postmortem examination, raising the possibility that a systemic effect of clostridial toxin plays a role. Despite these unanswered questions, the results of this investigation suggest that psychiatric inpatients, especially those with constipation, are vulnerable to severe outcomes from _C. perfringens_ intoxication. Institutions should ensure that precautions to prevent _C. perfringens_ and other causes of foodborne illness are in place. Providers of psychiatric care also should be aware that impaired intestinal motility places their patients at risk for adverse outcomes, including death, when exposed to enterotoxin-producing _C. perfringens_.""References:1.
