The target population consists of more than 2 million people in 12 districts in 10 provinces.Democratic Republic of the Congo epidemiological update (as of 12 Oct [2016]):- The last confirmed non-sylvatic case had symptom onset on 12 Jul [2016].- A new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Lingomo Health Zone in Tshuapa province.- 16 probable cases are under investigation (4 in Kinshasa, 8 in Kwango, and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, Lualaba and Sud Ubangi provinces).- The reactive vaccination campaigns in Feshi Health Zone in Kwango province is ongoing and will begin shortly in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province.Analysis- The continuing detection and investigation of probable (including the 42 probable cases in Angola) and sylvatic cases demonstrate that active surveillance is ongoing. Nevertheless, it is important to note persistent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation capacities, which may delay case detection. A strong and sustained surveillance effort remains crucial.- The status of the probable cases in Angola will be reviewed by the Ministry of Health's Final Classification Committee once the investigations are completed on their exposure history and yellow fever vaccination status.Epidemiological situationAngola42 probable cases were reported in the last 4 weeks (figure 1: this and other tables and figures cited are available at the URL above. - Mod.SH).From 5 Dec 2015-6 Oct 2016 (table 1):- 4220 suspected cases, with 373 deaths (case fatality rate (CFR): 8.8 per cent);- 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 per cent).Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces (table 2). Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces.Democratic Republic of the CongoFrom 1 Jan - 12 Oct 2016 (figure 2, table 1):- 2916 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces;- 77 confirmed cases have been identified from 2800 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 per cent);- Of the 77 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces (figure 4), 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous1, and 7 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak).A new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Lingomo Health Zone in Tshuapa province. This case was under investigation last week and is reported to have symptom onset on 28 Jul [2016]. Including this new case, there have been 4 confirmed cases reported in Tshuapa; all 4 cases were classified as sylvatic.16 probable cases are under investigation (4 in Kinshasa, 8 in Kwango and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, Lualaba and Sud Ubangi provinces).ResponseInformation on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website.In Angola, a Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) assessment started last week in 8 provinces, including Luanda, to provide input for the development of risk communication messaging. Entomologic assessments have been completed in 3 rovinces. Preliminary results suggest the level of infestation of _Aedes aegypti_ is high in Bengo, medium in Kwanza Norte and low in Kuando Kubango provinces.In Angola, phase 2 of the vaccination campaign launched on 10 Oct [2016]. The target population consists of more than 2 million people in 12 districts in 10 provinces.In Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 10-day reactive vaccination campaigns in Feshi Health Zone in Kwango province is ongoing and will begin shortly in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted in August [2016].WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile, with additional vaccine doses from the manufacturer Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.As of 14 Oct 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for Democratic Republic of the Congo (table 3).The number of vaccine doses currently available in the ICG global stockpile for emergency response is 5.9 million (table 4). The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the past week, the number of probable cases in Angola has increased from 32 to 42. Laboratory confirmation or refutation is needed urgently in order to know if foci of yellow fever (YF) transmission continue. Intensive surveillance with laboratory support is essential in order to mount a timely vaccination response.A series of graphs, tables and map are not shown but available in the original document at the above URL. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>]
