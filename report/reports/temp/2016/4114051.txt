WHO, Influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update - 259 (based on data up to 06 March 2016)----------------------------------------------------------Summary-------Globally, high levels of influenza activity continued to be reported. In some countries in northern Europe influenza B virus detections were increasing. In North America, influenza activity continued to increase and ARI [acute respiratory infections] and pneumonia activity were above thresholds in Mexico. In Northern Temperate Asia, influenza activity was ongoing with increasing levels of influenza B virus.- In northern and south west Europe, influenza detection continued to remain high with increasing activity of influenza B virus. In Eastern Europe, influenza activity and SARI [severe acute respiratory infections] activity seemed to have peaked (how about central and western Europe?)- In North America, Mexico reported above expected levels of ARI and pneumonia activity during this period. Increasing influenza activity predominantly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus continued to be reported in Canada and USA.- In Northern Temperate Asia, influenza activity was ongoing with influenza B activity predominating.- In Western Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease. Oman reported ongoing low levels of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B activity.- In South East Asia, ongoing influenza activity was reported during this period with predominantly influenza B detections.- In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America and the Caribbean, influenza and other respiratory virus activity were overall at low levels. In Jamaica however, SARI activity remained high with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating while high RSV activity was reported in Ecuador.- In the temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere influenza virus activity remained low.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 96 countries, areas, or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 22 Feb 2016 to 6 Mar 2016 (data as of 18 Mar 2016 04:15:14 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 159 429 specimens during that time period. 47 202 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 35 026 (74.2 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 12 176 (25.8 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 15 851 (87.3 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2300 (12.7 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 588 (25.2 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 1747 (74.8 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.[The detailed influenza update can be accessed at the source URL above.]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In most influenza transmission zones/regions described by WHO (<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/transmission_zones/en/>), influenza activity is still quite strong, but the detection rate of influenza B viruses has increased. Since the last report (see archive no. 20160313.4090542), influenza B virus detection has risen by almost 5 per cent, although the B-Victoria lineage still dominates.Among the influenza A viruses, the season has been dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and this trend is still evident. No new or novel influenza viruses have been reported in humans during this period. - Mod.UBA]
