Agricultura [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.radioagricultura.cl/2016/02/19/wav-confirman-caso-de-virus-hanta-en-la-region-de-ohiggins/>A 54 year old woman is currently in the critical care unit of the hospital in Rengo, with the presence of [a] hantavirus confirmed this morning. According to information from SextaNoticias.cl, this agricultural worker who works in the Las Cabras community was urgently taken to [the health] assistance service due to symptoms common to this disease. Due to this situation, investigations were done in the places that the woman had visited in order to determine where she might have been infected with the disease. The Regional Service  of the Ministry of Health [SEREMI; Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud] rushed to the scene to conduct the interview protocol of the affected [person]. Eduardo Penalosa, health SEREMI, was emphatic in signaling citizens to take precautions regarding clean places to visit during the holidays, [staying away] from brushy areas.While the woman remains under observation, the [health] authorities call for rodent control in areas of common access by mice, which carry the disease [caused by a] hantavirus.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.rg>[Much of central and southern Chile is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The above report provides little information about the circumstances under which the woman acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>. - Mod.TY]
