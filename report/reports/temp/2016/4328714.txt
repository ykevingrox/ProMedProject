The cause was as surprising as his precipitous decline: a bite on the thumb from a pet cat.The nip transmitted a bacterium common to household animals, which in turn triggered a seldom-reported complication, an aneurysm in the thick vessel that delivers blood to much of the body, according to a newly published case study by the doctors who tried to save the man.With animal bites among the most common complaints in emergency wards, the authors warn other physicians to be vigilant and act quickly if they suspect the rare, but potentially deadly cat-bite complication. And to head off those dire problems, as well as much more common local infections, anyone who is bitten by an animal should get a preventive course of antimicrobials, says Dr Dennis Cho, an emergency medicine resident who co-authored the new study. ""There is a whole host of places where these bacteria can latch onto, which is why it's kind of a scary thing,"" Cho said in an interview. ""The long-term consequences are not recognized and probably under-detected."" The manuscript was published in the World Journal of Clinical Cases.The researchers say he appeared at the emergency department of Toronto General Hospital last winter [2015-2016] complaining of weakness and abdominal pain. He had also been experiencing chills and lost nearly 10 kilograms [22 lb] in just 2 weeks. Those and other signs pointed to sepsis -- blood infection -- and then an ultrasound revealed worse. There was a large, 10-centimetre [3.9 in]-wide aneurysm, or enlargement, in the abdominal part of his aorta -- the garden-hose-thick vessel that descends from the heart through the torso.A CT scan indicated it had ruptured, raising the fear of massive internal bleeding. Emergency surgery replaced part of the aorta with a synthetic ""tube valve,"" and revealed the vessel was inflamed and brittle. But what had caused all this was still a mystery. Then tests on pieces removed from the aorta wall found the etiology: infection by _Pasteurella multocida_, a bacterium common in pets' mouths and most often spread by the bite of felines, with their sharp and penetrating teeth.When the man first came to hospital, his wife had mentioned he had been bitten by their cat 4 weeks earlier; the local infection cleared up quickly. Doctors didn't think twice about the episode at the time. ""Sometimes as physicians we roll our eyes at information that seems to be extraneous,"" Cho admitted. ""Only looking back did we realize this was probably the key to unlocking the true diagnosis."" The man was treated with penicillin after the operation but died 2 weeks later of severe sepsis, a likely sign of the virulence of the _P. multocida_ bacterium, the Toronto General doctors say.Cho said cases of animal bites are common, something the average emergency physician probably sees once on every shift. People who are heavy drinkers -- as the Toronto patient was -- or otherwise immune-compromised seem at particular risk of long-term complications of the bacterium, the study said.A Dutch man who likely became infected _P. multocida_ from one of his several cats lived after a similar ordeal and surgery, according to a 2009 paper. A 2000 report described a Swiss man who survived an infected aortic aneurysm after his dog infected him by licking psoriasis sores.[Byline: Tom Blackwell]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[I have read the paper referred to in this posting (Cho DD, Berliner Y, Carr D: Deadly case of _Pasteurella multocida_ aortitis and mycotic aneurysm following a cat bite. World J Clin Cases 2016; 4(6): 142-5; <http://www.wjgnet.com/2307-8960/full/v4/i6/142.htm>). There seems no doubt that the organism caused a mycotic aneurysm that ruptured into the retroperitoneum but his initial deterioration was likely to be due to the rupture of the aorta which precipitated the multi-organ failure rather than the sepsis. Additionally, his demise 2 weeks later was associated with ""septic shock"" but it is not stated if _P. multocida_ was isolated from the blood at that time.Mycotic aneurysms due to this organism are quite rare (1-3) and it is not clear if the process begins de novo or occurs related to infection of an already formed aortic aneurysm.Primarily, _P. multocida_ is a cause of skin and soft tissue infections following feline or canine bites and licks to open wounds. As an infectious diseases clinician, our group sees at least one case per month of the infection mostly related to cat bites. The sharp teeth of the cat easily penetrate deeper in the skin, as most dog bites, and can introduce the organism into deeper structures such as tendon and bone. One hallmark of _P. multocida_ skin and soft tissue infections is the rapid onset of signs of inflammation which often occurs within several hours of the bite.References----------1.
