WHO Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-april-2016-elizabethkingia-usa/en/>Elizabethkingia - United States of America------------------------------------------On 11 Apr 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the USA notified PAHO/WHO of an outbreak caused by _Elizabethkingia anophelis_.From 1 Nov 2015 to 30 Mar 2016, a total of 57 cases were reported from Wisconsin (56) and Michigan (1), including 18 deaths. [Currently, 63 cases and 4 possible cases in Wisconsin with 19 deaths as well as one fatal case in both Illinois and Michigan - Mod.LL]. The majority of the cases had _E. anophelis_ isolated from the bloodstream. Other cases had the bacterium isolated from other sites, including respiratory systems and joints. Most cases are over the age of 65 years, and all have serious underlying health conditions. It has not yet been determined whether the deaths associated with this outbreak were caused by the bacterial infection, the patients' comorbidities, or both.Many potential sources of the bacterium have been assessed, including water sources, health care facilities, medications and personal care products, though no common source has been identified to date. Investigations are ongoing.Public health response----------------------Health authorities in the USA are taking the following measures:- administering antimicrobial treatment to those with _E. anophelis_ infections,- providing information about infection control and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to all health care providers, infection prevention specialists and laboratories state-wide.WHO risk assessment-------------------Although _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ is commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil and water, [While this is the case with _E. meningoseptica_, the epidemiology of _E. anophelis_ is less clear. - Mod.LL], it rarely causes illness in humans. A few small, localized outbreaks were reported before, usually in healthcare settings. The current outbreak in the USA is the largest known outbreak of elizabethkingia on record. Since the transmission route of the bacterium remains unknown and bacterium primarily infects people with serious underlying health conditions, further cases can be expected. PAHO/WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.WHO advice----------PAHO/WHO encourages national public health authorities to report any cluster of _E. anophelis_ cases and the potential identified cause by using the established communication channels under the International Health Regulations (2005).--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] CDC report, current outbreakDate: Wed 20 Apr 2016Source: CDC [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/elizabethkingia/outbreaks/index.html>CDC, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS), the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) are investigating an outbreak of infections caused by a bacterium called _Elizabethkingia anophelis_, which is usually found in the environment. The majority of the infections identified to date have been bloodstream infections, but some patients have had elizabethkingia isolated from other sites, such as their respiratory systems or joints.Wisconsin was 1st notified of 6 potential cases between 29 Dec 2015 and 4 Jan 2016 and set up statewide surveillance on 5 Jan 2016. CDC issued a nationwide call for cases on 20 Jan 2016, via the Emerging Infections Network and again on 2 Mar 2016, via the Epidemic Information Exchange system, also known as Epi-X. These alerts asked states to look for any infections similar to the ones reported in Wisconsin, and to send isolates from any potential cases to CDC for testing to determine if they match the bacterium causing infections in Wisconsin.In response to the outbreak of elizabethkingia infections in Wisconsin, Michigan sent a state health alert on 8 Feb 2016 asking providers and laboratories to review records for elizabethkingia specimens identified since 1 Jan 2014. On 29 Feb 2016, the MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories received an elizabethkingia isolate from a recently submitted blood sample and forwarded the isolate to CDC for additional testing, where it was determined to match the bacterium causing the outbreak in Wisconsin.Illinois sent alerts to hospitals on 10 Feb and 29 Mar 2016 requesting they report all cases of elizabethkingia and save any specimens for possible testing at public health laboratories. To date, only one isolate from Illinois has matched the bacterium causing the outbreak in Wisconsin.Although elizabethkingia is a common organism in the environment (water and soil), it rarely causes infections. CDC is assisting with testing samples from a variety of potential sources, including healthcare products, water sources and the environment; to date, none of these have been found to be a source of the bacteria.CDC will continue to work with WDHS, MDHHS, and IDPH to identify the source of the bacteria and develop ways to prevent these infections.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] CDC report, Illinois past outbreakDate: Wed 20 Apr 2016Source: CDC [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/elizabethkingia/outbreaks/index.html>CDC and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) are investigating a cluster of infections caused by _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ in 10 Illinois residents who have been diagnosed since 1 Jan 2014. The strain of _E. anophelis_ in this cluster is different from the strain that is causing the outbreak in Wisconsin. Six of the 10 patients have died. However, IDPH is unable to determine whether elizabethkingia was the cause of death because many of those individuals had underlying health conditions.The cases were identified after IDPH sent alerts to Illinois hospitals and laboratories in early February 2014 and again in March 2014 requesting that they report all cases of elizabethkingia going back to the beginning of 2014. Recent CDC testing of the specimens confirmed that the same strain made the 10 people sick but that the strain is distinct from the strain that has been identified in Wisconsin.Illinois health officials continue to collect case histories and other information to try to find a connection among these patients. Previously, health providers were not required to report individual cases of elizabethkingia, so it is difficult to determine the degree and kind of exposure that results in illness. For the same reason, it is difficult to estimate how many cases of illness actually occur each year.Investigation into the Wisconsin outbreak has led to increased awareness of elizabethkingia and additional reporting of cases to CDC. Technological advancements in laboratory testing have allowed scientists to differentiate _E. anophelis_ from other types of elizabethkingia and to identify patient clusters within this species. As CDC and state health departments work together to investigate these outbreaks, other clusters may be identified.Healthcare providers in Illinois should be aware of the recently identified cluster and consider elizabethkingia as a potential cause of bloodstream infections among patients.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] CDC commentaryDate: Thu 7 Apr 2016Source: CDC expert commentary [edited]<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/861096>_Elizabethkingia anophelis_, the Gram negative bacterium causing an ongoing and deadly outbreak in Wisconsin and, recently, Michigan, is generally a rare cause of illness in healthy individuals. _E. anophelis_ is an environmental microorganism that is not part of the human microflora and was originally isolated from the midgut of anopheline mosquitos. The clinical presentation of _E. anophelis_ infection resembles many other more likely etiologies, and, therefore, it may not be among the top candidates for a potential cause of bloodstream infections. In addition, diagnostic capabilities across many states and clinical labs may not be sufficient to identify this genus, let alone species, quickly, which affects patient treatment. _E. anophelis_ is also resistant to many commonly prescribed antimicrobials.The cases in Wisconsin and Michigan represent the 1st reported outbreak of _E. anophelis_ in the USA and the largest known outbreak of elizabethkingia on record, with 53 confirmed cases and 17 deaths as of 28 Mar 2016.Background, diagnosis, and treatment of elizabethkingia-------------------------------------------------------Although commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil and water, elizabethkingia rarely causes disease in otherwise healthy individuals. CDC laboratories receive 5-10 isolates per year in each US state. Following the recognition of this outbreak, CDC asked states to send isolates of all species of elizabethkingia for further testing to confirm whether the isolate was from the main outbreak cluster or an unrelated case. The recent call for case-finding has shown that some cases of elizabethkingia infection may be unrecognized.In this outbreak, the bacteria primarily infect older adults and those who have serious underlying health conditions. The infection typically presents as septicemia and can be deadly if not treated early with appropriate antibiotics. (The fatality rate in the current outbreak is about 30 per cent.) Clinicians who have patients with underlying health issues and bloodstream infections of unknown etiology should consider elizabethkingia as a possible cause.Diagnosis and testing---------------------Diagnosis is made on the basis of results of culture from sterile sites, most often blood. However, owing to its rarity, some clinical laboratories use bacterial detection software that may misidentify elizabethkingia as other bacteria. Therefore, if results come back as _Flavobacterium meningosepticum_ or _Chryseobacterium meningosepticum_, CDC advises clinicians to report these results to the state health department for consultation, and to treat presumptively as _E. anophelis_.State clinical microbiology laboratories can characterize the isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a method that can identify the _Elizabethkingia_ genus correctly. Isolates sent to CDC's Special Bacteriology Reference Laboratory are confirmed as the species _E. anophelis_ on the basis of the pathogen's protein profile, acquired using the mass spectrometry method MALDI-ToF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight), and optical mapping of the bacterial genome.Treatment of the current outbreak---------------------------------Even though this bacterium is resistant to many antimicrobials used to treat Gram negative rod bloodstream infections, Wisconsin clinical microbiology laboratories, along with CDC, have identified that the strains responsible for most cases in the current outbreak are susceptible to several antimicrobials. These include fluoroquinolones, rifampin, minocycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. If possible, combination treatment is recommended over monotherapy. For best results, treatment should be selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for each suspected case.Health departments, hospitals, and clinical laboratories wanting to learn more about elizabethkingia and other rare pathogens can join MicrobeNet, a CDC-curated virtual reference library that helps laboratorians and clinicians get the information they need to accurately identify causes of disease faster and save lives. MicrobeNet provides laboratorians, at no cost, with unprecedented access to CDC's virtual microbe library of more than 2400 rare and emerging infectious bacteria and fungi. It contains complete information about growing and identifying the bacteria, and, for many pathogens, information on antibiotic resistance.CDC and the affected states continue to work toward managing the ongoing outbreak. The unexpected number of infections with this unusual pathogen reminds us of the importance of new and emerging technologies, such as advanced molecular detection and MicrobeNet, to quickly detect and track rare and deadly pathogens like elizabethkingia.[byline: John McQuiston, PhD]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail HealthMaps:Wisconsin: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/250>Illinois: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/216>]
