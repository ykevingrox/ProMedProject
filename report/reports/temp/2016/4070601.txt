This represents 71.5 percent of cases notified.The new report released on Tuesday (1 [Mar 2016]) points out, also, that 1046 notified cases have been discarded and 641 confirmed for microcephaly and other nervous system changes suggestive of [some] congenital infection.By 27 Feb [2016], in all, 5909 suspected cases of microcephaly were recorded [reported]. The 641 confirmed cases occurred in 250 municipalities located in 15 Brazilian states: Alagoas, Bahia, CearÌÁ, MaranhÌ£o, ParaÌ ba, Pernambuco, PiauÌ , Rio Grande do Norte, EspÌ rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, ParÌÁ, RondÌ«nia, GoiÌÁs, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul.The 1046 cases were discarded based on normal complementary investigation [including transfontanel ultrasound and/or brain tomography], or in face of cases of microcephaly and/or central nervous system abnormalities not related to [congenital] infectious causes.Note that the Ministry of Health is investigating all microcephaly and[/or] other central nervous system disorder cases reported by the states and the possible link with the virus Zika and[/or] other congenital infections. Microcephaly may have the cause of various infectious agents beyond Zika such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus.According to the report, the 5909 cases that were reported since the beginning of investigations on 22 Oct last year [2015] were recorded in 1143 municipalities in 25 Brazilian states.The Northeast region has 81 percent of reported cases, and Pernambuco continues with the greatest number of cases that remain under investigation (1672), followed by the states of Bahia (817), ParaÌ ba (810), Rio Grande do Norte (383), CearÌÁ (352), Rio de Janeiro (261), Alagoas (222), Sergipe (192) and Maranhao (192).In all, 139 deaths were reported as related to microcephaly and/or alteration of the central nervous system after birth (stillbirth) or during pregnancy (miscarriage or stillbirth). Of these, 31 were confirmed as microcephaly and / or central nervous system abnormalities. Another 96 are still under investigation and 12 have been not confirmed.Of the total confirmed cases of microcephaly, 82 were reported by specific laboratory criteria for Zika virus. However, the Ministry of Health points out that this figure does not represent suitably the total number of instances related to virus. The Ministry considers that there was Zika infection in the most mothers who had babies with a final diagnosis of microcephaly.To date, there are 22 Brazilian states with autochthonous circulation [and potential transmission] of Zika virus: GoiÌÁs, Minas Gerais, Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Roraima, Amazonas, ParÌÁ, RondÌ«nia, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, SÌ£o Paulo and ParanÌÁ.--Communicated by: ProMED-PORT <http://www.promedmail.org/pt>[According the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the definition of criteria, including the confirmed and discarded, are the following:- ""Total cumulative reported cases from 2015 to 2016 (5909 cases)"": ""cumulative number of reported cases that met the previous operating case definitions (less than 33 cm) and the adopted in Surveillance Protocol (by 9 Dec 2015) that defined the head circumference 32 cm for newborns with 37 or more weeks of gestation and other protocol settings.""- ""Investigated and confirmed (641 cases)"": ""The cases have typical changes: indicative of congenital infection, as intracranial calcifications, dilation of cerebral ventricles or changes in the posterior fossa and other clinical signs observed by any image diagnostic method or Zika virus identification in laboratory tests."" ""82 cases were confirmed by specific laboratory testing for Zika virus (serology or PCR).""- ""Investigated and discarded (1046 cases)"": discarded by normal exams or because presenting microcephaly and/or congenital malformations related by non-infectious causes or not framed in case definitions. - Mod.RNA][A map showing the location of the states mentioned can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Rio de Janeiro casesDate: Fri 4 Mar 2016Source: The New England Journal of Medicine DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1602412 [edited]<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602412>PatrÌ cia Brasil, M.D., Jose P.

To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses.Methods-------We enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data.Results-------A total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82 percent) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28 percent had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44 percent vs. 12 percent, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40 percent vs. 7 percent, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58 percent) and in all ZIKV-negative women. Fetal abnormalities were detected by Doppler ultrasonography in 12 of the 42 ZIKV-positive women (29 percent) and in none of the 16 ZIKV-negative women. Adverse findings included fetal deaths at 36 and 38 weeks of gestation (2 fetuses), in utero growth restriction with or without microcephaly (5 fetuses), ventricular calcifications or other central nervous system (CNS) lesions (7 fetuses), and abnormal amniotic fluid volume or cerebral or umbilical artery flow (7 fetuses). To date, 8 of the 42 women in whom fetal ultrasonography was performed have delivered their babies, and the ultrasonographic findings have been confirmed.Conclusions-----------Despite mild clinical symptoms, ZIKV infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction, and CNS injury.--Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[This report provides additional evidence strengthening the relationship between Zika virus infections of pregnant women and fetal malformations. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
