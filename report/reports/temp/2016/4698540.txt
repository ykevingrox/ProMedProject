New cases have also been reported in the governorate of Al Jawf for the 1st time.The prevention and intervention efforts by WHO, in partnership with the Ministry, UNICEF, OCHA and other partner organizations, has helped to reduce the spread of the disease in some governorates, while new cases continue to be reported in others. Up to 26 cholera treatment centres have been set up in the affected governorates and surveillance for acute watery diarrhea has been enhanced in all governorates of the country. The WHO is providing support to the 2 national health emergency control rooms in Aden and Sana'a to ensure quality data collection and has mobilized rapid response teams for effective and timely epidemiological investigation and response.The WHO has strengthened the capacity of local health workers through training on case management and infection control. Essential supplies such as rapid diagnostic test kits, IV fluids, oral rehydration solutions and water chlorination tablets have been provided in affected communities. The WHO has also supported social mobilization and health education campaigns among citizens to raise their awareness on prevention of cholera and other diarrheal diseases.Acute watery diarrheal diseases are endemic in Yemen; however the ongoing conflict has stretched the capacity of the national health systems. More than 7.6 million people and more than 3 million internally displaced persons [IDPs] currently live in areas affected by the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. Numbers are likely to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman.Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
