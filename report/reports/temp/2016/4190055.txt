SA Health announced the new figure on Wednesday, 27 Apr 2016, after testing confirmed the link to the popular Asian garnish. While the source of the _Salmonella_ remains a mystery, the contamination has been linked to the consumption of raw bean sprouts sourced from Queensland and grown and packaged in South Australia.A spokeswoman from the health department told The Advertiser investigations were ongoing.The public health warning, announced on Thursday last week [21 Apr 2016], comes as authorities revealed a huge surge in the number of people diagnosed with the _Salmonella enterica _ serotype Saintpaul strain since December 2015. One of the victims included a pregnant woman who was rushed to hospital after suffering abdominal pain about 2 weeks ago.[Byline: Katrina Stokes] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is a good review of sprouts-associated outbreaks in the USA:Dechet AM, Herman KM, Chen Parker C, et al: Outbreaks caused by sprouts, United States, 1998-2010: lessons learned and solutions needed. Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2014;11:635-44.""Abstract---------After a series of outbreaks associated with sprouts in the mid-1990s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines in 1999 for sprouts producers to reduce the risk of contamination. The recommendations included treating seeds with an antimicrobial agent such as calcium hypochlorite solution and testing spent irrigation water for pathogens. From 1998 through 2010, 33 outbreaks from seed and bean sprouts were documented in the United States, affecting 1330 reported persons. 28 outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_, 4 by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and 1 by _Listeria_. In 15 of the 18 outbreaks with information available, growers had not followed key FDA guidelines. In 3 outbreaks, however, the implicated sprouts were produced by firms that appeared to have implemented key FDA guidelines. Although seed chlorination, if consistently applied, reduces pathogen burden on sprouts, it does not eliminate the risk of human infection. Further seed and sprouts disinfection technologies, some recently developed, will be needed to enhance sprouts safety and reduce human disease. Improved seed production practices could also decrease pathogen burden but, because seeds are a globally distributed commodity, will require international cooperation."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/286>.]
