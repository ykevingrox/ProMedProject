WHO microcephaly/Zika virus, situation reports [edited]<http://www.salud.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WHO-Zika-Situation-Report_19-02-2016.pdf>Zika virus microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome situation report -- 19 Feb 2016----------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------- Between January 2007 and 17 Feb 2016, a total of 41 countries and territories reported local (autochthonous) transmission of Zika virus, including those where the outbreak is now over. One country (United States of America) reported a locally acquired case without vector-borne transmission, likely to have been contracted by sexual contact, and indirect evidence of local transmission has been documented in 6 additional countries. In the week running up to 17 Feb 2016, 2 new countries/territories have reported local transmission (Aruba and Bonaire).- 6 countries/territories (Brazil, French Polynesia, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia, and Suriname) have reported an increase in the incidence of cases of microcephaly and/or Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following a Zika virus outbreak. Microcephaly has so far been reported only from Brazil and French Polynesia. Puerto Rico and Martinique have also reported cases of GBS associated with Zika virus infection, but without evidence of an overall increase in the incidence of GBS.- Evidence that neurological disorders, including microcephaly and GBS, are linked to Zika virus infection remains circumstantial, but a growing body of clinical and epidemiological data possibly leans towards a causal role for Zika virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The complete report is available at the source URL above. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Cases in various countries:AmericasMexico and Central America---Mexico (national). 16 Feb 2016.

(comment) Experts debunked a theory this week that linked pesticides to an increase in birth defects, thought to be caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil. Pyripyroxyfen interferes with a mosquito growth hormone, preventing the larvae from developing into adults, said biologist Laura Harrington, professor and chairwoman of the entomology department at Cornell University in New York. Humans do not have insect juvenile growth hormone and the World Health Organization deems pyriproxyfen safe for use as a pesticide.<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/16/experts-dismiss-claims-pesticide-not-zika-causes-birth-defects/80451116/>[Pyriproxyfen (PPF) is one of the most active chemicals among the juvenile hormone mimic (JHM) group, and has been used for mosquito control in western Kenya for malaria vector control, and in many areas for control of agricultural insect pests. Information from Africa or other localities where PPF is being used or has been used, concerning any adverse effects or lack of them, in humans would be welcome. - Mod.TY]Colombia (national). 12 Feb 2016.

One factor that seemed to support the [Zika virus etiology] was the isolation of the virus in brain tissue of microcephalic infants. These isolations do not prove causation. It is possible that brain tissue in cases of microcephaly become susceptible to Zika virus infection by a mechanism such as diminution of he blood-brain barrier.--Stephen J Seligman, MDAdjunct ProfessorCasanova LabSt. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious DiseasesThe Rockefeller UniversityNew York, NY 10065USA<sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu>[ProMED thanks Dr Seligman for his comments. It will be interesting to see if any of the Brazilian scientists tracking microcephaly there have any thoughts about factors that might facilitate Zika virus entry into the CNS. - Mod.TY]******[4] WHO responseDate: Wed 17 Feb 2016Source: Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-who-idUSKCN0VQ141>The World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Wed 17 Feb 2016] that USD 56 million would be needed until June [2016] to fund a strategy to combat the Zika virus, which has spread to 39 countries and has been linked to birth defects in Brazil.The funds sought, including USD 25 million for the WHO, would be used to fast-track vaccines, carry out diagnostics and research into how the mosquito-borne virus spreads, as well as virus control, the WHO said.Last year [2015], the United Nations health agency was forced to admit its handling of an Ebola virus epidemic, which killed more than 11 300 in 2 years, most of them in West Africa, had been inadequate. Public health expert Lawrence Gostin said on [Wed 17 Feb 2016] the WHO's reaction to the Zika emergency was again ""too little, too late.""The WHO declared the Zika outbreak a global public health emergency on 1 Feb [2016], noting its association with 2 neurological disorders, microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barre syndrome that can cause paralysis.Director-General Margaret Chan will travel to Brazil from 22-24 Feb [2016] to review Zika-related measures supported by WHO and will meet the health minister, a WHO spokeswoman said.""Possible links with neurological complications and birth malformations have rapidly changed the risk profile for Zika from a mild threat to one of very serious proportions,"" Chan said in the WHO's strategy paper.But Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University in Washington, warned that the WHO had ""grossly underestimated"" the task as the virus was likely to spread to many other regions from the Americas.States with major Zika outbreaks could incur up to a 10 percent loss in GDP [gross domestic product], as was ""likely"" in Brazil, he said in a statement.""The WHO put out financing estimates during Ebola, which were also far from adequate, and it repeatedly raised (them) as the epidemic unfolded. It is doing the same thing now with Zika.""The WHO had failed to learn the ""fundamental lesson"" from Ebola, Gostin said. ""That lesson is that mobilizing funding in the midst of a global emergency will always be too little, too late.""The WHO expects the funds to come from states and other donors and said that in the meantime it has tapped a new emergency contingency fund for USD 2 million for initial operations.There is no treatment, but hopes of developing a vaccine against Zika took a small step forward on [Wed 17 Feb 2016] as US biotech firm Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc said its experimental shot had induced a robust and durable response in mice.Brazil said on [Wed 17 Feb 2016] it is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4443 suspected cases of microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems.Researchers have confirmed 508 of these cases as microcephaly. The ministry said last week [week of 8 Feb 2016] that 41 of the confirmed cases of microcephaly had shown links to Zika infection but did not update the figure.The WHO noted that ""existing scarce evidence indicates that there may be a risk of sexual transmission"" of Zika virus.""There is currently very little evidence of mother-to-child transmission; however, intra-uterine infections seem to be associated with subsequent neurological conditions in the child.""Research studies are needed to assess the presence of the Zika virus in semen and other body fluids, and potential sexual transmission, and mother-to-child transmission, the WHO said.[Byline: Stephanie Nebehay; editing: Raissa Kasolowsky]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It was quite clear from the beginning of the Zika outbreak and its early spread in Brazil, that there were no epidemiological or ecological barriers to its extension to countries in the Americas, where _Aedes aegypti_ were already present and transmitting dengue and chikungunya viruses. That spread is underway now.Vaccine availability or massive international vector control with genetically modified mosquitoes are not likely to appear on the scene for 18-24 months, at best. Meanwhile, the virus marches on. The only interim approach is mobilization of local citizens to reduce the water catchments where the vector mosquitoes breed and to avoid mosquito bites. That will require an intensive public education effort on a large geographic scale, starting now. - Mod.TY]
