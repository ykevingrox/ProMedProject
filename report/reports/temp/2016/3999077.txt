The Coles 4 Leaf Mix, Woolworths salad mix, SupaSalad Supamix, and Wash N Toss salad mix, with best before dates leading up to, and including, 14 Feb 2016, are part of a statewide recall. Several other brands and products have been added to the list. Diet-food delivery service Lite n' Easy has also warned its customers not to eat the salad component in its pre-made lunches and to seek medical attention if they had eaten them and felt unwell.The department's senior medical advisor, Finn Romanes, said there were a higher than usual number of cases of the _S._ Anatum strain.Dr Romanes called the outbreak of ""moderate size, but quite significant"" and urged people to not consume the recalled bags.Dr Romanes said tests of 3 products from 2 batches of pre-packaged lettuce distributed by Tripod Farmers also tested positive for theSalmonella bacteria. Given the prevalence of the products and their distribution through supermarkets, he said the cases known to date were likely to be the ""tip of the iceberg."" ""We do expect to see more cases,"" he said. ""We are working with the company to understand what may have occurred... They have instituted a comprehensive clean-up to make sure any risk is minimized.""[Byline: Sumeyya Ilanbey]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2]  Date: Fri 5 Feb 2016Source: Brisbane Times [edited]<http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/eight-queensland-salmonella-cases-may-be-linked-to-contaminated-lettuce-20160205-gmn4vc.html>8 cases of salmonellosis in Queensland may be linked to pre-packaged lettuce distributed by a Victorian-based company, the state health body says.
