Gulf Times<http://www.gulf-times.com/story/490886/Camel-worker-tests-positive-for-Mers-in-Qatar>A 40-year old camel worker has tested positive for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) announced.It is the 2nd case confirmed in Qatar so far this year [2016].The worker, who was neither in contact with a suspected patient nor abroad during the last 2 weeks, is free from chronic diseases that usually cause immunity suppression. He was admitted to Hamad General Hospital [in Doha] with general symptoms where routine investigations tested positive for MERS-CoV, despite him not exhibiting any respiratory related symptoms.The patient is currently in stable condition and receiving the necessary medical care in the isolation ward, according to the national protocol for infection prevention and control, the ministry said in a statement.After the tests proved positive, the rapid response team of MoPH carried out extensive search to list all potential contacts to check for their possible consistence with the standard case definition of the suspected cases, based on the World Health Organisation guidelines. All traced contacts will be monitored over a period of 2 weeks, while those who develop suspected symptoms will then be subjected to confirmatory laboratory investigation, the ministry added.While research efforts continue on a global and local level to determine the modes of transmission of MERS-CoV infection, the MoPH has advised citizens and residents who suffer from chronic diseases to avoid direct contact with camels and to wash hands with soap and water thoroughly. Also recommended are implementing respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and the need to boil camel milk before drinking.MoPH added that Health Protection & CDC Hotlines 66740948 and 66740951 are accessible 24/7 to respond to any notification or inquiry related to infectious diseases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The text of the media report above is almost verbatim from the MoPH announcement, also released today (2 May 2016 and available at <https://www.moph.gov.qa/news/moph-announces-the-second-mers-cov-case-in-2016?backArt=326&page=2>). On 22 Feb 2016, there was a report of a case of MERS-CoV infection in a 66 year old Qatari male who had a farm (with camels and sheep) in Saudi Arabia. The addition of this newly confirmed case brings the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Qatar to 15 since 2012. It is noteworthy that in the absence of respiratory symptoms, the history of camel contact most probably led to testing for MERS-CoV infection in this patient, suggesting a high index of suspicion on the part of the medical community treating this patient.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Qatar can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/130>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia 3 new cases, 1 death - MOH 26 Apr-2 May 2016Date: Mon 2 May 2016Source: Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx?PageIndex=1>As of 12 noon today [2 May 2016], there have been a total of:1381 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including588 deaths [reported case fatality rate 42.6 percent]784 recoveries, and9 currently active casesIn the past 7 days, since the last ProMED-mail update, there have been a total of:3 newly confirmed cases1 newly reported fatality, and5 newly reported recoveriesInformation on newly confirmed cases (3):2 May 2016 (1):<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-05-2-001.aspx>1- A 40 year old expat male from Riyadh, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition.
