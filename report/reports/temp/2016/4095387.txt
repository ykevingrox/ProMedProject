The Daily Star [subscription only, edited]<http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2016/Mar-15/342246-ex-mp-blasts-health-ministry-as-three-die-of-yellow-fever.ashx>Former MP Dr. Ismail Sukkarieh publicly criticized the Health Ministry Monday [14 Mar 2016] for not taking vaccination against yellow fever seriously enough, despite a number of Lebanese expats living in high-risk regions such as West Africa.Sukkarieh's statement comes after at least 3 Lebanese expats died of the disease in Angola in the last week.He argued that the ministry ought to be the official and sole authority providing its citizens with the preventative vaccine.In his statement, Sukkarieh also claimed that some travelers to Africa were given fraudulent certificates for the vaccination, without actually receiving the treatment.Local TV network Al-Manar identified the 3 dead citizens [by name].""Every person traveling, especially to tropical areas like Africa, which has dangerous diseases, should take certain vaccines, including the vaccine against yellow fever,"" Sukkarieh told The Daily Star. ""The [Health] Ministry [should] register the people vaccinated, their passport number and the country of destination and, at the end of the year, this information [should be] referred to the World Health Organization,"" Sukkarieh added.The WHO defines yellow fever as ""an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes."" Although difficult to diagnose, the WHO estimates that nearly 50 percent of those affected may die of the disease without adequate treatment. Yellow fever does not have a particular treatment, but rather ""[symptomatic and] supportive treatment"" to combat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever, according to the WHO website. Preventative measures to combat mosquito bites, including vaccination prior to exposure and mosquito control (such as bed nets), can help alleviate the risk of catching the disease.Although the Lebanese affected were residing in Angola when they caught the disease, Sukkarieh argued, ""[they] traveled from here. The vaccine is valid for a lifetime. If they were vaccinated, they wouldn't have had it."" He went on to say: ""What is needed is for the Health Ministry to carry out its role and provide the vaccine.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This situation should be investigated. If, in fact, fake yellow fever (YF) vaccination cards are being sold, the practice should be halted at once. Not only are individuals not protected and run the risk of being infected, and in this case dying, but individuals infected in Angola could transport the virus to other parts of the world. If those places have vector mosquitoes present, there is the possibility of initiating ongoing transmission leading to an outbreak.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165> and Lebanon at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/85>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.]
