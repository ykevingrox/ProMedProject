Lakeshore Weekly News[edited]<http://www.swnewsmedia.com/lakeshore_weekly/news/local/hopkins-legionnaires-investigation-continues/article_c181e277-56f9-53cb-98d3-76578b233936.html>The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) continues to investigate an outbreak of legionnaires' disease [LD] in Hopkins [MN]. To date, 23 cases of LD have been confirmed in people who live, work, or spend time in Hopkins. This total reflects 3 additional cases confirmed by MDH between [28 and 30 Sep 2016].The most recent illness onset date for known cases is [22 Sep 2016]. The pattern of where those infected were likely exposed is consistent with a community-wide exposure to contaminated water that became aerosolized, most likely from a cooling tower. Extensive interviews with LD cases and/or family members did not identify a common exposure -- such as a restaurant or a store or specific building -- other than living, working, or spending time in Hopkins.To date, 7 locations with one or more cooling towers have been identified by Hennepin County Public Health and the city of Hopkins, in collaboration with MDH, as being possible sources. As of [29 Sep 2016], all of these cooling towers have been or are being remediated by their owners.Environmental samples from cooling towers within the area of concern have been collected. These tests are in process. _Legionella_ are slow growing bacteria and testing for the bacteria in the laboratory can take weeks.While the remediation of known cooling towers is important in reducing any ongoing risk to people in the area, MDH will not consider the investigation complete until all nearby cooling towers that could be a source of the Hopkins illnesses are identified and remediated, and no additional cases are identified.It's important to note that cooling towers are not registered in Minnesota and therefore no state or local registry or master list of cooling towers exists, making identification difficult. Building owners are responsible for operating cooling towers consistent with industry standards. MDH recommends all building owners with cooling towers review guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding implementation of a water management program to reduce _Legionella_ growth. A toolkit and more information can be found at: CDC: Developing a Water Management Program to Reduce _Legionella_ Growth and Spread in Buildings.Minnesota and many other states have seen an increase in the number of LD cases in recent years. From 2012 through 2015, Minnesota had an annual total of 50-58 confirmed cases of LD. To date in 2016, more than 90 cases have been reported. Most cases of LD are reported in later summer and early fall.Cases of LD not associated with the Hopkins outbreak continue to be reported to MDH. All cases are interviewed to identify potential clusters or outbreaks; most cases are not part of an outbreak or cluster.Most people exposed to _Legionella_ don't become infected. People who may be at an increased risk include those over the age of 50 [years], smokers, or those with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune system, chronic lung disease, or other chronic health conditions.The best advice for concerned Minnesotans is to be aware of the symptoms of potential infection with _Legionella_ and seek medical care promptly if you or a loved one develops these symptoms. Symptoms of _Legionella_ infection can include fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, mental confusion, diarrhea, and vomiting. _Legionella_ infection can be diagnosed by health care providers through non-invasive means using a urine test and can be treated with antibiotics.[Byline: A Schwarz]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.We are told in the news report above that the number of confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease in Hopkins, Minnesota, has increased from 20, when last reported, to 23. All cases have lived, worked, or spent time in Hopkins, where 7 locations with one or more cooling towers have been identified as being possible sources. Cultures of these towers for _Legionella_ are still pending. As of 29 Sep 2016, all of these cooling towers have been or are being remediated.Hopkins, with a population of 17 591 in 2010, is a suburban city located in Hennepin County, 3 miles [4.8 km] west of the city of Minneapolis (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins,_Minnesota>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55433>.]
