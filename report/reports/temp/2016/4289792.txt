Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Polio-virus-found-in-Hyderabad-alert-in-Telangana/articleshow/52755733.cms>Polio virus was found in Hyderabad, and Telangana is on alert. The strain was found in a sewerage sample taken from the Amberpet sewerage treatment plant on 17 May 2016. The Telangana government is to airlift 2 lakh [200 000] vaccines from Geneva to inoculate more than 3 lakh [300 000] children. The government said it is launching a vaccination programme as a preventive measure.The Telangana government on Tuesday 14 Jun 2016 sounded a ""global emergency"" after an active strain of wild polio virus (P2 strain) was detected in a water sample collected from a drain, prompting it to airlift 200 000 vaccines from Geneva to inoculate more than 300 000 children in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy district as a ""preventive measure"" from Wednesday [15 Jun 2016].The vaccine derived polio virus (VDPV) strain has not been seen in the country for more than 5 years. While no case of polio has been reported so far, the strain, doctors said, must be contained, as it continues to be reported in neighbouring countries and West Asia that are well connected with Hyderabad. The government said it is launching a massive vaccination programme as a preventive measure.""The government has decided to conduct a special campaign against polio in Hyderabad and parts of Ranga Reddy from [20-26 Jun 2016],"" said Rajeshwar Tiwari, principal secretary, health. He added that this wasn't the 1st time that the strain was traced. The wild polio strain was previously detected in Bihar, Gujarat, UP and even Delhi.The strain was found in a sewerage sample taken from the Amberpet sewerage treatment plant on [17 May 2016] during routine surveillance after 30 samples were taken from various parts of the city. The earlier administered oral polio vaccine contained P1, P2 and P3 strains, but with the P2 strain of the virus not surfacing in a long time, the vaccines too did not contain the P2 strain.""In this case, the P2 strain is vaccine derived. Someone vaccinated 10 months to a year back released the strain through stool. Such rare cases happen when a child's immunity is very low. To avoid such stray cases that happen one in a million, the P2 strain is no longer given even in vaccines,"" said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, chief programme officer, National Health Mission, Telangana.""We'll be following WHO set standards during our programmes,"" he added. As part of the special campaign, children aged between 6 weeks to 3 years will be given additional doses of the injectable polio vaccine (IPV). Booths will be set up in areas being covered in these campaigns.Officials said they would deploy monitoring teams to all these places, but there won't be any door-to-door vaccination campaign. Parents of children living in these areas will be encouraged to ensure their children get the IPV dose from the vaccine booth, which will provide additional protection against all types of polio.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] India (Hyderabad), environmental sample positive - media reportDate: 16 Jun 2016Source: Daily Pioneer [edited]<http://www.dailypioneer.com/todays-newspaper/vaccine-derived-polio--virus-surfaces-in-hyd.html>Amidst concerns over wild polio virus (Type-2) being found in sewage water in Amberpet, a thickly populated area of Hyderabad, the Union Health Ministry on Wednesday [15 Jun 2016] said it was a vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV) and does not change the polio-free status of India. Despite this, the Telangana Government has decided to launch a vaccination drive covering all kids in the age group of 6 weeks to 3 years as a preventive measure.State Principal Secretary, Health, Rajeshwar Tiwari said that the vaccination drive will be taken up from [20 to 26 Jun 2016] and will cover 336 000 children in Hyderabad and neighbouring Ranga Reddy districts.Instead of the normal bivalent oral vaccines, this time, anti-polio injections will be administered, as the oral drops do not contain the Type-2 poliovirus.""There is no need to panic. As India has been declared 'Polio Free' 5 years ago, tests are carried out regularly to ascertain whether there are traces of polio virus in the environment. If it is found, vaccination has to be carried out again in that area so that the children are not affected,"" said Tiwari.Incidentally, between January 2015 and May 2016, a total of 14 sewage samples collected from different parts of the country tested positive for VDPVs. However, the last case due to the Type 2 strain in India was detected on 13 Jan 2011, and the country was certified polio-free by WHO in March 2014.The virus found in Hyderabad was from one of the 30 samples collected from all over the country 2 weeks ago and tested at the Enterovirus Research Center in Mumbai.The finding of the Type-2 strain in Hyderabad created a stir at the international level as it raised questions about the claims that polio was totally eradicated from India 5 years ago. The WHO has issued an alert. Officials said 200 000 vaccines were being airlifted from Geneva.Explaining the difference between the Type-2 strain and other strains, Dr G Srinivas Rao, Chief Programme Officer, National Health Mission (Telangana), said that a child who may have been administered the oral vaccine about a year back might have passed the virus through stool. ""It is a very rare, one in a million case, and happens when the immunity of a child is low,"" he added.At an emergency meeting of the officials of the Medical and Health Department in Hyderabad, it was decided to set up 756 vaccination centres in Hyderabad and 122 in Range Reddy district.Meanwhile, the Union Health Ministry said a review of the area revealed that the population immunity against the Type-2 strain is high, as trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) was in use in the state until [24 Apr 2016], and 2 mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in January and February [2016].""94 per cent of children received at least 3 doses of OPV. Therefore, chances of its transmission are unlikely,"" the ministry said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org> [According to the Polio Eradication Initiative, the last reports of cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) type 2 in India were in 2008 and 2009 (see <http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx>). While some of the media reports are speculating that this newly identified VDPV2 isolate from environmental samples had been circulating for 10 months to a year, it is important to mention that India just made the switch to the use of bivalent OPV (OPV containing type 1 and type 3) in April 2016. According to the most recent polio surveillance weekly report in India as of 25 May 2015, in 2015 there were 2 VDPV associated polio cases in India, one in Delhi and one in Madhya Pradesh, and in 2016, there was one VDPV associated polio case in Bihar (see <http://www.searo.who.int/india/topics/poliomyelitis/afpsurveillancebulletin_25may2016.pdf?ua=1>. There are 3 types of VDPVs: the 1st is known as cVDPV, circulating vaccine derived poliovirus; the 2nd is associated with immuno-deficient recipients and is known as iVDPV; and the 3rd is considered as coming from an ambiguous origin and is known as aVDPV. More details on these 3 types of VDPVs can be found at <http://www.polioeradication.org/polioandprevention/thevirus/vaccinederivedpolioviruses.aspx>. From the above media reports, it is unclear whether this identified VDPV is considered to be a cVDPV or perhaps an iVDPD. We await further information from the polio reference labs in India.A previous ProMED-mail poliomyelitis update mentioned that during the period 17 Apr 2016 to 1 May 2016, 155 countries and territories switched from the use of the trivalent to bivalent oral polio vaccine with the plan that withdrawing the type 2 component of OPV would protect future generations against the most prominent circulating vaccine derived poliovirus, type 2 (see Poliomyelitis update (06): Nigeria cVDPV environmental sample, global, RFI 20160512.4217800). India was one of the 1st countries to make the switch to the bOPV, not having identified cVDPV2 since 2009.There was an expected hiatus between the switch from tOPV to bOPV and the implementation of the use of IPV, with concerns vocalized regarding the period of time when OPV2 would not be used and the possible loss of protection against cVDPV2. One can only hope that the identification of the VDPV2 in Hyderabad is an isolated event rather than a new incipient outbreak associated with OPV2 administered through April 2016. We await more results from the polio reference laboratory in India.Hyderabad is in the southcentral portion of India and is the capital of Telangana state, and formerly the capital of Andhra Pradesh prior to the formation of Telangana state. It has approximately 6.7 million inhabitants with a metropolitan population of approximately 7.75 million, making it the 4th most populous city and 6th most populous urban agglomeration in India <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad>.

The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in 2016 remains 3 and 8 in 2015.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.- National Immunization Days using the bivalent oral polio vaccine are planned for [23 Jun 2016 - 1 Jul 2016].Madagascar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015] from Sud-Ouest region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 remains 10.- The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset of paralysis in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus.- The 3rd Outbreak Response Assessment in Madagascar found that the surveillance system is not yet strong enough to conclude that polio transmission has been interrupted. 39 high-risk districts have been identified to receive focused attention.Myanmar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in 2016.

In October [2016], NIDs are planned in Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone, and SNIDs in Mauritania.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The Polio Eradication Initiative puts out its weekly updated statistics on Thursdays of every week, hence there will be a new edition available tomorrow (Thu 16 Jun 2016). Given the identification of the VDPV2 in the environmental sampling in Hyderbad, I've decided it was important to disseminate this information. In addition, the discussions regarding VDPV and cVDPV contained in the above report adequately highlight concerns when VDPVs are identified in countries, concerns that vaccination levels have decreased to levels that would permit the circulation of VDPVs.Highlights of this most recent report include noting that in the approximate one month since the prior poliomyelitis update on ProMED-mail, there have been a total of 2 newly identified wild poliovirus (WPV) associated cases, both in Pakistan, a very significant decrease in WPV-associated disease from last year (2015), when there was an increase from one case to 26 cases during the same time frame.It's nice to have a weekly report that says there have been no new WPV associated cases and no new cVDPV cases identified during the week's interval.The most recent map showing the locations of the WPV and cVDPV associated cases of paralytic polio as of 7 Jun 2016 can be found at: <http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx>.  - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.]
