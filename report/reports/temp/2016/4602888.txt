This is the 1st case of the disease registered in the state since 2012.The man, 37, was bitten by a vampire bat while he slept, on [16 Sep 2016], according to the state Department of Health of CearÌÁ. It is reported that he did not seek medical care after the accident and that the first symptoms of the disease were manifested a month after the attack. The farmer was admitted to hospital St. Joseph of Infectious Diseases last Thursday [20 Oct 2016] The department said the patient was given human anti-rabies serum and asked the Ministry of Health for Biopterin, the medicine used in the treatment of the disease. The ministry has already sent the medicine. Also according to the secretary, CearÌÁ is conducting the search for others who may have been exposed to aggressive bats.According to the Department of Health of CearÌÁ between 2005 and 2012, 5 cases of human rabies were confirmed in CearÌÁ. In only 1 case was the transmission made by a dog, in the city of Chaval, in 2010. The other 4 cases were transmitted by marmosets (soins) in SÌ£o LuÌ s do Curu, in 2005, Camocim's, in 2008, in Ipu in 2010 and Jati in 2012.Rabies is a viral disease that can be transmitted to humans by bite, lick or scratch of an infected animal. The main transmitters are dogs, cats, bats and monkeys (marmosets or soins). The disease is virtually lethal. To date, only 2 people have survived it, 1 in the United States and 1 in Pernambuco; but both with clinical sequelae.To prevent transmission of the disease, the recommendation is to wash the wound with soap and water and seek health services immediately. Human rabies vaccine must be given as a pre-exposure treatment to the risk or post-exposure to the virus, both in case of light accidents and serious accidents.The Ministry of Health recommends vaccination of dogs and cats as the main way to avoid cases of rabies in human, in addition to movement control of type 3 virus, also found in vampire bats.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The anti-rabies vaccine should ALWAYS be given if you think you have been bitten, scratched contaminated with bloody, saliva of a suspected rabid animal in ALL cases. This man was bitten in September, and did not immediately seek treatment. His prospects are almost nil now.Vampire bat rabies is common throughout Brazil and is why domestic and livestock, especially valuable animals, must be vaccinated. This farmer has only a small chance of survival. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
