They all agreed to do that, so they are immune and are not passing the disease amongst each other, and the other was for the staff to either be vaccinated or provide proof of immunity,"" Schryer said. ""However, probably about 40 percent of the staff have not done that, and what we're seeing today and the reason we're seeing cases out of that facility is because the staff are passing measles amongst each other and unfortunately they're going out into the community so we expect to see more cases from those exposures.""Schryer said workers are refusing vaccination requests and employers are trying to convince them otherwise.The Corrections Corporation of America [CCA] operates the Eloy Detention Center under contract with the United States government.""The vast majority of CCA employees have received vaccinations or shown proof of prior immunity,"" said CCA spokesman Jonathan Burns. ""There do remain a small number of CCA employees who are in the process of locating proof of prior immunity. After consultation with public health officials, that small number of employees is being required by facility leadership to wear surgical masks while on site until proof of immunity has been verified.""That mandate, Burns said, only applies to CCA employees. He said a substantial number of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] employees also work at the facility.A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson declined to be interviewed but in an email said, ""ICE employees who work at the Eloy Detention Center are not required to receive measles immunizations as a condition of employment.""ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe declined to discuss whether ICE employees working at Eloy are refusing vaccinations, citing federal medical confidentiality rules.Hearings were supposed to begin again at the immigration court after they were temporarily suspended in May [2016]. But a new measles case found Mon [27 Jun 2016] prompted federal immigration officials to keep the detention center restricted and the adjacent immigration court closed until 14 Jul [2016].The new case brings the total number of measles cases in Arizona to 20.Dr. Cara Christ is director of the Arizona Department of Health Services.""We are also seeing staff and that's the most current cases have been, they've been staff that have been working at the facility that have been exposed but they've gone out into the community,"" she said.Christ said one difficulty facing health care workers is that people carry the measles virus 4 days before visible symptoms appear.ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe said there are currently 1221 people held at the Eloy Detention Center.She sent this statement about ICE's efforts to get the private prison employees to agree to vaccinations:""ICE continues to work closely with state and county health officials to monitor detainees and employees at the Eloy Detention Facility in the wake of the recent measles outbreak. In consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and local health authorities, ICE has instituted numerous measures to prevent further spread of the disease. Medical staff with the ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC), aided by the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Pinal County Health Department, have administered measles vaccinations to the detainees. The agency also provided measles immunizations to facility employees who could not establish they had prior immunity and requested to be vaccinated. Detention staff were also referred to the Eloy and Casa Grande clinics nearby for vaccinations. Flyers and educational pamphlets detailing the dangers of measles and vaccination information have been provided to detainees and staff at the facility. Finally, detention center employees who requested additional personal protective equipment while on duty were provided with disposable masks and gloves.""[Byline: Michel Marizco]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Previous reports on this ongoing outbreak in the Eloy detention center in Arizona can be found in ProMED-mail posts Measles update (27): Cambodia, UK (England), Malaysia, USA (AZ) 20160629.4317125 and Measles update (23): Cambodia, Sudan, USA (FL,AZ) 20160609.4273557.A map of Arizona, United States can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/207>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Australia (Victoria)Date: Fri 1 Jul 2016Source: Herald Sun [edited]<http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/more-victorian-measles-cases-confirmed-amid-outbreak-fears/news-story/77232c27cde9150c08e8fd99b2bd471e>More Victorian measles cases confirmed amid outbreak fears----------------------------------------------------------Two more cases of measles have been confirmed in Victoria, leading to significant concerns of a large-scale outbreak after a 1st case of the infection was reported yesterday [30 Jun 2016].Victoria's acting Chief Health Officer, Dr Finn Romanes, has voiced concerns over the public's safety after a young woman, who was diagnosed on Fri [1 Jul 2016], is said to have visited Melbourne's CBD, the airport, Shepparton and parts of Queensland while carrying the disease.Dr Romanes said that while there was no direct link between the 3, investigations conducted by the department have suggested there is now a potential spread of the infection in Geelong, the Surf Coast and the west and northwest suburbs of Melbourne, and the inner city.He added the 3 infected are all aged from 18 to 30, caught the airborne virus in early to mid-June [2016] and had not recently left Australia -- leading to worries the spread has come from within our borders.""Our concern is that there was a person or persons who probably had travelled overseas, and have since unknowingly passed on measles to these 3 people in the western suburbs and Barwon Area -- and there may be more."" Dr Romanes said.""There is now the potential for these 3 people and anyone else that has been infected to pass on the disease and create a significant outbreak."" He added.Measles has an incubation period of 18 days, meaning that those carrying the disease may not experience any signs of symptoms for more than 2 weeks.""We are concerned that people may have been infected from coming into contact with these cases in mid to late June,"" Dr Romanes said.""Illness acquired from contact could still be coming through, and cases could still remain infectious for many days.""The Department of Health and Human Services have urged anyone who experiences symptoms of measles to seek medical help as soon as possible, to prevent a potentially disastrous epidemic.""Anyone unwell with a fever and rash who is not fully vaccinated for measles should ring ahead to their doctor or hospital and alert them that they may have measles,"" urged Dr Romanes.""The doctor or hospital will then be able to immediately isolate them while assessing for measles, which will minimise spread to others.""Measles is now relatively uncommon in Australia, due to the widespread use of the vaccine which prevents the disease.Young children are particularly in danger of developing pneumonia and other serious complications, often leading to hospitalisation.Measles usually begins with common cold symptoms such as fever, sore throat, red eyes and a cough. The characteristic measles rash usually begins 3-7 days after the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body.Latest figures show that 94 per cent of Victorian children aged up to 5 years are fully immunised against measles but Dr Romanes urged parents of all children to ensure their immunisations are up-to-date.[Byline: Richard Jones] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Victoria is a state in the south-east of Australia. Victoria is Australia's most densely populated state and its 2nd-most populous state overall. Melbourne is the capital. A map of Victoria, Australia can be accessed at <http://bit.ly/29aaZA1>.As measles is highly infectious through airborne transmission, other cases could occur in susceptible people. Measles has an incubation period of between 7 and 18 days (average 14 days from exposure to rash) so should be considered in any susceptible person who presents with a compatible illness now or up until late-March 2016.It is important that clinicians consider measles as a differential diagnosis in any susceptible patients with a clinically compatible illness. These patients need to be identified early and isolated to minimise the risk of transmission of this highly contagious virus to others. Measles must be notified to the Department of Health and Human Services immediately upon suspicion (which includes testing for measles or referring for further medical assessment) ... to allow the Department to instigate urgent public health measures such as contact tracing. Delayed notification of cases (for example, waiting for serological confirmation, when strong clinical features are already present) in this outbreak hinders the public health response aimed at preventing the spread of disease. Refer to the Recommendations section below for more information.Who is at risk?---------------- Children or adults born during or since 1966 who do not have documented evidence of receiving 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or documented evidence of laboratory-confirmed measles immunity are considered to be susceptible to measles.- People who are immunocompromised are also at risk.Symptoms and transmission-------------------------Measles initially presents with a prodrome of fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and coryza. A generalised maculopapular rash develops 2 to 5 days after the onset of the prodrome, coinciding with fever. Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa may be present for three to four days prior to rash onset but not at time of rash. Individuals, especially children, are typically unwell.Clinical case definition: the following clinical features must be present to meet the case definition for measles:- generalised maculopapular rash, usually lasting 3 or more days, AND- fever (at least 38 degrees C, if measured) present at the time of rash onset, AND- cough or coryza or conjunctivitis.Measles is transmitted by airborne droplets and direct contact with discharges from respiratory mucous membranes of infected persons and less commonly by articles freshly soiled with nose and throat secretions.Measles is highly infectious and can persist in the environment for at least 30 minutes.The incubation period is variable and averages 10 days (range: 7-18 days) from exposure to the onset of fever, with an average of 14 days from exposure to the onset of rash. The infectious period of patients with measles is 5 days before, to 4 days after, the appearance of the rash.Excerpted from <https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/about/news-and-events/healthalerts/measles-outbreak-in-melbourne> - Mod.LK][A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/288>.]
