GOACOM [edited]<http://goacom.com/virology-institute-confirms-presence-of-kfd-virus-in-goa/>The Pune-based National Institute of Virology [NIV] has confirmed that the samples lifted from the 3 dead monkeys from Sattari taluka [Goa state] have tested positive to the Kyasanur Forest disease [KFD] virus.Furthermore, the 97 samples lifted from 382 local people by the directorate of health services have also been found positive to the KFD infection [antibodies?].Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, an epidemiologist in the directorate of health services, told 'The Navhind Times' that the 3 samples of the dead monkeys which had been sent by the department of animal husbandry and veterinary services to the NIV have been found positive to the KFD virus. In the last 2 years, several villagers from Mauxi, Zarme and Copardem in the taluka have been diagnosed with the KFD, commonly known as monkey fever.This year [2016], a 60-year-old woman from Mauxi reportedly died of the disease, though she was also suffering from other illnesses.Director of animal husbandry and veterinary services Dr Santosh Desai said that 10 monkeys had been found dead in the villages of Sattari taluka. The department had sent samples of 3 dead monkeys to the NIV, which have been found positive to the virus.Also, 3 more samples of the dead monkeys would be sent to the NIV shortly, he said, adding that samples of the other 4 dead monkeys could not be lifted as the carcasses had been putrefied and were disposed of by forest officials.Dr Betodkar said that local health officials had taken 382 samples of locals from the affected villages and so far 97 samples of the people have been found [antibody?] positive to KFD infections.Strict vigilance is being kept by officials in the affected villages. Besides, an awareness campaign is also being carried out.As far as vaccines are concerned, he said that an official of the Karnataka government-run viral diagnostic laboratory in Shivamogga has informed that the process quality control test of vaccines would be completed by 25 Feb [2016]. The directorate of health services is likely to receive the 1st consignment of 500 vaccines by the end of this month [February 2016].The state government has placed an order of 1500 vaccines to check spread of the disease.Once the 1st lot of 500 vaccines is received by the directorate of health services, another leg of the vaccination drive would be carried out to administer 1st dose of the vaccine to the people of the KFD-hit villages.After the 2nd consignment of the vaccines is received, 2nd dose would be given to the people administered with the 1st dose.Some 358 people from Pali village had been administered with the 1st dose of vaccine. However, only 212 of them took the 2nd dose last year [2015].Expressing his happiness over people co-operating with the authorities vis-a-vis the disease, the state epidemiologist said, ""As soon as we receive new vaccines the vaccination drive would be taken up in all the 3 villages probably during the weekend, or as per the convenience of the villagers. Besides, the vaccines would be made available at the community health centre, Valpoi.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Because Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) cases occurred in Goa in 2015 and are continuing into 2016, it was likely that this monkey died of a KFD virus infection as well. That is laboratory confirmed now. The proactive vaccination and public information programs should help to reduce the risk of human KFD virus infections. As noted in the previous posts, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case fatality rate is 3-5 per cent (see the CDC fact sheet at <http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html>).Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although monitoring ticks for KFD virus provides information for issuing alerts, the only means for prevention of infection is avoidance of tick bites.Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf>).Maps of India showing the location of Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala, the states where KFD virus is endemic and cases have been occurring over the last year, can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/states/> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/301>. - Mod.TY]
