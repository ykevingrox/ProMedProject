Focus Taiwan [edited]<http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201605170015.aspx>Taiwan has recorded 275 new cases of hepatitis A so far in 2016, the highest number for the same period in recent years, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tue 17 May 2016. Half of the 275 infections were among people with HIV, the CDC said, citing data valid as of 15 May 2016.CDC Director-General Steve Kuo said most of the hepatitis A cases were recorded in the northern half of the country, with New Taipei accounting for 33.98 percent, Taipei 28 percent, Taichung 12.3 percent, and Taoyuan 9.1 percent.In view of the situation, Kuo said, the CDC is planning to expand its hepatitis A vaccination program at the end of 2016. Among people under the age of 40, the 1st dose of the hepatitis A vaccine will be free if they have HIV, acute gonorrhea or primary syphilis, he said. However, they will be required to pay for the 2nd dose, Kuo said, adding that it is advisable for people with compromised immune systems to also have a 3rd dose of the hepatitis A vaccine.[Byline: Chang Ming-hsuan, Lilian Wu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if anti-HAV negative.In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al: Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol 2012; 54:26-9, abstract available at: <http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract>), a large and long-lasting (more or equal to 18 months) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A occurred in Rome metropolitan area at least since July 2008, involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.The posting refers to a recommended 3rd dose of HAV vaccine in immunocompromised hosts but the current US CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule-bw.pdf>) currently advises 3 doses only if part of the combined HAV/HBV sequence. The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from ACIP are:Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and persons with any of the following indications:-men who have sex with men;-persons who use injection or noninjection illicit drugs;-persons working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;-persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates;-persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and-unvaccinated persons who anticipate close personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.Single-antigen vaccine formulations should be administered in a 2-dose schedule at either 0 and 6-12 months (Havrix), or 0 and 6-18 months (Vaqta). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose schedule may be used, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30 followed by a booster dose at 12 months. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>.]
