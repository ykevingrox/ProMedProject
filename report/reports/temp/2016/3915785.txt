WHO Ebola Situation Report [edited]<http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-6-january-2016>Summary---------No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 3 Jan [2016]. On 29 Dec [2016], WHO declared that human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus had ended in Guinea, after the completion of 42 days with 0 cases since the last person confirmed to have EVD received a 2nd consecutive negative blood test for Ebola virus RNA. Guinea has now entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have all now succeeded in interrupting human-to-human transmission linked to the original outbreak in West Africa.Human-to-human transmission linked to the most recent cluster of cases in Liberia will be declared to have ended on 14 Jan 2016, 42 days after the 2 most-recent cases received a 2nd consecutive negative test for Ebola virus, if no further cases are reported. In Sierra Leone, human-to-human transmission linked to the primary outbreak was declared to have ended on 7 Nov 2015. The country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance scheduled to conclude on 5 Feb 2016.The most recent cluster of cases in Liberia was the result of the re-emergence of Ebola virus that had persisted in a previously infected individual. Although the probability of such re-emergence events is low, the risk of further transmission following a re-emergence underscores the importance of implementing a comprehensive package of services for survivors that includes the testing of appropriate bodily fluids for the presence of Ebola virus RNA. The governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone, with support from partners including WHO and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, have implemented voluntary semen screening and counselling programmes for male survivors in order to help affected individuals understand their risk and take necessary precautions to protect close contacts. 405 male survivors had accessed semen screening services up to 3 Jan 2016 in Liberia and Sierra Leone. A network of clinical services for survivors is also being expanded in Liberia and Sierra Leone, with plans for comprehensive national policies for the care of EVD survivors due to be completed in January 2016. To date, approximately 3000 survivors have accessed basic care services.In order to effectively manage and respond to the consequences of residual Ebola risks, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have each put surveillance systems in place to enable health workers and members of the public to report any case of illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD to the relevant authorities. In the week to 3 Jan [2016], 645 alerts were reported in Guinea from 33 of the country's 34 prefectures, with the vast majority of alerts (639) being reports of community deaths. Over the same period, 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 282 new and repeat samples (18 samples from live patients and 264 from community deaths) from only 16 of the country's 34 prefectures. In Liberia, 633 alerts were received from all of the country's 15 counties, the vast majority of which (529) were for live patients. The country's 5 operational laboratories tested 588 new and repeat samples (420 from live patients and 168 from community deaths) for Ebola virus over the same period. In Sierra Leone, 952 alerts were reported in the week to 3 Jan 2016 from all of the country's 14 districts. The vast majority of alerts (878) were for community deaths. 976 new and repeat samples (8 from live patients and 968 from community deaths) were tested for Ebola virus by the country's 8 operational laboratories over the same period.The deployment of rapid-response teams following the detection of a new confirmed case continues to be a cornerstone of the national response strategy in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Each country has at least one national rapid-response team, with strengthening of national and subnational rapid-response capacity and validation of incident-response plans continuing throughout January 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] monitoring, lessons, research4 Jan 2016 Guinea: Ebola-free Guinea cleared to resume hosting international soccer matches<http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/ebola-free-guinea-cleared-to-resume-hosting-international-soccer-matches-1.2722623>[The Confederation of African Football (CAF) wrote to Guinea's soccer federation on Monday [4 Jan 2016] ending a ban which was imposed in August 2014 and applied to national and club teams.

These include: politics of purpose, providing the right platform, aligning people with success, proactive public engagement, prolific partnerships, pioneering alternative pathways, and priming the system. The article explains how these 7 factors worked to keep Nigeria's outbreak small.]4 Jan 2016 USA (PA). Philadelphia health department stops daily monitoring for Ebola <http://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-health-department-stops-daily-monitoring-ebola/>[The Philadelphia Department of Public Health has ceased daily monitoring of travelers to and from the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone affected by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak. Monitoring began on 22 Oct 2015. The health department monitored 961 people for EVD symptoms from 22 Oct 2014 to 29 Dec 2015. The health department also removed its recommendation that clinicians screen patients for travel to Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone.]Research-----4 Jan 2016: Determination of the Spontaneous Mutation Frequency of Ebola virus and Exploitation of this Therapeutically<http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2015/12/08/JVI.02701-15.full.pdf+html>[Alfson KJ, Worwa G, Carrion Jr Ricardo, et al. Online publication 16 Dec 2015. _Journal of Virology_.Results. Ultra deep sequencing revealed that the mutation frequency for EBOV was high and similar to other RNA viruses. Interestingly, significant genetic diversity was not observed in viable viruses, implying that changes were not well tolerated. We hypothesized that this could be exploited therapeutically. In vitro, presence of ribavirin increased the error rate and the IC 50 was uM. In a mouse model of pre-EBOV exposure ribavirin therapy, ribavirin treatment corresponded with a significant delay in time to death and up to 75 percent survival. In mouse and monkey models of post-EBOV exposure therapy, ribavirin treatment also delayed the time to death and increased survival.Discussion. These results demonstrate that EBOV has a spontaneous mutation frequency similar to other RNA viruses. These data also suggest a potential for therapeutic use of ribavirin for human EBOV infections.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A zoonotic niche map of the countries where cases have occurred in the field or been imported is at <http://healthmap.org/ebola>.
