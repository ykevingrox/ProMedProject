When the 1st dengue vaccine in the world Dengvaxia was cleared for release in Mexico in December 2015, the Malaysian Health Ministry hesitated to introduce it in the country. To date, the vaccine has been licensed in Mexico, the Philippines, Brazil, El Savador and more recently, Costa Rica. This is amid concerns on the safety, efficacy and cost of the vaccine. The Malaysian government has not bowed down to pressure from certain quarters to implement the vaccine and made it clear that it would wait until June 2016 to decide on whether to use Dengvaxia in the country. When Bernama recently contacted the Director General of Health Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah on the matter, he said that the country has to wait further, as WHO's guidelines and recommendations on Dengvaxia usage would only be released in July 2016.
