Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-10/06/c_135735129.htm>The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality on Thursday [6 Oct 2016] issued an advisory over West Nile fever. It recommended that anyone who visited the provinces of Cadiz, Huelva and Seville in southwest Spain over the past 28 days not donate blood, Spanish TV network RTVE reported.The recommendation made by the Scientific Committee for Blood Transfusion Safety comes after the detection of 3 cases of West Nile fever in humans, as well as other cases in horses.The ministry confirmed it made the recommendation as a temporary precautionary measure and insists there is no reason for alarm. The regional government in Andalusia activated its protocol for vigilance following the confirmation of the 1st case of West Nile fever by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control this summer.West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne virus which in the majority of cases produces only mild flu-like symptoms. However, in a small percentage of cases, it can lead to serious complications such as inflation of the brain and spinal cord with fatal consequences.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is widespread in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and southern Europe, where it causes outbreaks and sporadic cases of the disease. It has become an emergent disease in North America, where it was detected for the 1st time in 1999 and became epidemic shortly thereafter [Briese T, Jia XY, Huang C, Grady LJ, Lipkin WI Lancet. 1999 Oct 9; 354(9186):1261-2].The epidemiology of WNV in Europe differs from that in America and has only been associated with nonrecurrent, sporadic outbreaks. In Spain, neither equine nor human WNV cases had been reported before 2006, although some human serosurveys had indicated that WNV or closely related flaviviruses circulated during the 1970s in the Ebro delta and areas in Spain [Antibodies against the West Nile virus and other arthropod-transmitted viruses in the Ebro Delta region. Lozano A, Filipe AR Rev Esp Salud Publica. 1998 May-Jun; 72(3):245-50].Another group reported the 1st human case of WNV infection in a 21-year-old male presenting with clinical and biological signs compatible with viral meningitis. Acute and convalescent serum samples showed IgM and IgG positivity for WNV [<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17366016>]. Other studies have provided serologic evidence of WNV infections in birds, horses, and humans in Spain and surrounding countries, where the highly pathogenic WNV strains sporadically cause clinical infections [<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/3/pdfs/09-1033.pdf>]. Globally, a small number of West Nile virus infections acquired from blood transfusions have been reported. However, blood collection agencies in various countries screen all donated blood for West Nile virus to minimize this risk [<http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/blood.html>]. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/43>.]
