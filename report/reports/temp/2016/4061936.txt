Hachaklait Clinical Veterinary Services, head veterinarian's weekly report No 2016/9 [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, summ, edited; subscription required]<http://www.hachaklait.org.il>Brucellosis in Kibbutz Revivim (continuing). During the last week [21-26 Feb 2016], 14 additional primipara cows [1st lactation], out of 200 in the cohort group (7 percent) have tested positive to _Brucella melitensis_ and consequently culled. This rate is lower than the one detected in previous tests.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Brucellosis, caused by _Brucella melitensis_ (field strain biotype 1) was detected in October 2015 in the dairy cattle operation of Kibbutz Revivim (see map at <http://tinyurl.com/gqfvw9c>) in an aborted calf. Subsequently, 135 dairy cows (out of a total of about 1300 in this segment) were identified as infected and subsequently destroyed. Since then, several repeated serum and milk tests have been performed by Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) in the dairy operation described above to try detect additional cases, aiming at recovering the farm's status as free of brucellosis. So far, the total number of animals found infected (most of them primipara = 1st lactation) is about 200, all culled against compensation. The total number of cattle, all ages, in the said collective farm exceeds 2000. It is one of Israel's 10 leading dairy operations, with an annual production of about 7.5 million liters. An initial report of the event was published by the VSAH on 2 Nov 2015 (see 20151103.3762268). An updated interim epidemiological report is anticipated.In response to our requests for information, we have received, from the Public Health Services in Israel's Ministry of Health (MOH), the following data, for which we are very grateful:""1. In relation to the _B. melitensis_ event in Kibbutz Revivim:a. 5 persons have been recognised as cases.b. 2 of the patients belonged to the personnel of the dairy cattle operation, 3 others were laborers in the Kibbutz.c. the start of their respective illness took place during weeks 45-52 of 2015.d. All patients were males, aged 15-44.e. Hospitalisation was not required (ambulatory treatment).2. The total (countrywide) number of reported brucellosis cases in humans in Israel during 2015 was 430.""The VSAH launched investigations into possible spread from Revivim to contact farms. The Grofit dairy farm, in the Arava region (southeast Israel; see map at <http://tinyurl.com/hrq323v>) was found to have purchased some cattle from Revivim. When tested, several positive animals were discovered and culled (see archive no 20151204.3840328). We have recently noted that this farm has been retested twice without additional cases detected.Leakage of _B. melitensis_ into high-yielding industrial dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening of the brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. The following statistics on the total annual number of human ""Malta fever"" (cases) have been published by Israel's Ministry of Health: 2005 (141); 2006 (138); 2007 (152); 2008 (149); 2009 (136); 2010 (139); 2011 (127); 2012 (183); 2013 (336); 2014 (596); and in 2015, as reported above, 430. While 2014 seems to have been a record year, 2015's figures are still higher than in the years before.There are numerous nomadic an backyard sheep and goat flocks in the vicinity of Revivim, in which brucellosis is known to be present. It may be assumed that the infection originated in such flocks. The route of _B. melitensis_ introduction from neighboring infected flocks into the (zero-grazing) Kibbutz dairy farm has yet to be established. An anecdotal source mentioned crows transporting residues of sheep/goats placentae into the water troughs of the dairy farm. In previous cases on cattle farms in Israel, stray dogs were mentioned as doing the same.For decades, brucellosis in livestock in Israel has been caused exclusively by _B. melitensis_. The pathogen of bovine brucellosis, _B. abortus_, which causes massive abortions in this species, has long been eradicated (last case in 1984). _B. suis_ has never been diagnosed in Israel.Several issues related to this event are under deliberation; the parliamentary 'Health Committee' of Israel's Knesset discussed the event on 23 Nov 2015 and issued a press communiquÌ© mentioning the approval of a budget of 50 million Israeli Shekels (about USD 13 million) for immediate control measures in animals (<http://main.knesset.gov.il/News/PressReleases/Pages/press231115u.aspx>; in Hebrew). A previous national attempt to control _B. melitensis_ in Israel, undertaken during the 1990's (last century), led to encouraging results but the project was not sustained due to discontinued budgetary support (see item 2 in archive no 20140622.2558324). This lesson deserves to be remembered. A carefully designed, multistage _B. melitensis_ control plan, taking into consideration all segments of the animal populations and their respective stakeholders, may have chances of success only if budgets and trained manpower in field and laboratory are secured for its entire duration. Such a project may aim at reducing, as much as possible, the infection rate in small ruminants and subsequently in humans, while preventing altogether outbreaks on cattle farms. Attempting to a complete durable eradication of the agent from Israel, as successfully achieved in relation to _B. abortus_, could be considered only if the project encompasses both Israel and the West Bank, cooperatively. Such a project was under advanced stages of planning within a regional animal-health project, which was operational during the 1990's, lamentably discontinued in 2002, due to the deteriorated political situation.Vaccination of female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with strain 19 brucellosis live attenuated vaccine has been compulsorily applied in Israel for decades; this vaccination was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014 (see 20151103.3762268). In case this policy change was preceded by a risk-assessment, its details will be interesting. The event in Revivim is expected to serve as a field experiment of real-life dimensions enabling to check whether there is a difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals concerning their infection and their respective shedding of the _B. melitensis_ bacteria. Results of such observations and their evaluation are expected with interest within and beyond Israel. Subscribers are referred to a recent study investigating how critical vaccination of cows might be, in order to control _B. melitensis_ on a mixed sheep-and-cattle farm. (Ref 1; thanks to Anton van Engelen for kindly indicating and forwarding this paper).The application of periodic MRT (milk ring test) in Israel's dairy farms was discontinued altogether on 1 Mar 2015. When notified on 26 Feb 2015, it was stated that this decision, obtained following a risk assessment, would be subject to evaluation/review every 2 years or when there is a new brucellosis outbreak on a dairy farm (available at <http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/A51D5662-DB7D-4D6D-AAD4-F1FA700DA379/0/mivhan__mrt.pdf>; in Hebrew).How long the pathogen has been circulating within the affected herd and how human infection occurred are additional issues to be clarified.Reference---------Beauvais W, Musallam I, and Guitian J: Vaccination control programs for multiple livestock host species: an age-stratified, seasonal transmission model for brucellosis control in endemic settings.
