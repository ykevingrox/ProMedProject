Dawn [edited]<http://www.dawn.com/news/1285841/environmental-samples-test-positive-for-poliovirus-in-quetta-pishin-districts>Five out of the 27 environmental samples collected from various parts of Balochistan tested positive for poliovirus, the provincial coordinator said on Saturday [24 Sep 2016].The Coordinator Emergency Operation Cell (EOC) Balochistan, Syed Faisal Ahmed, said the samples were tested positive for poliovirus in Quetta and Pishin districts of the province.He, however, mentioned that the virus detected in Quetta and Pishin was not indigenous, rather it belonged to Jacobabad and Afghanistan's Kandahar province.A sample is deemed positive if the polio virus is found in sewerage water, which is the basic parameter to determine whether anti-polio campaigns have been successful.While cases of polio can be reported from any city, due to the frequent movement of people, if the virus is found in sewerage, it means the anti-polio campaign in that area did not achieve its target.""We are determined to eradicate this crippling virus,"" Ahmed said while addressing press conference in the provincial capital.This year [2016], one polio case has been reported from Balochistan, whereas last year 6 polio cases were reported from the province.The EOC coordinator said that an anti-polio campaign will begin in Balochistan from [26 Sep 2016].More than 2.4 million children would be provided anti-polio drops in order to eliminate the crippling disease from the province, he said.He further reported that more than 6000 teams were constituted to ensure provision of polio drops to children below the age of 5 years.In response to a question, Ahmed said police, levies and Frontier Corps personnel would be deployed to guard polio teams in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan to avoid occurrence of any untoward incident.In Balochistan, militants have repeatedly attacked polio teams during anti-polio campaigns. A suicide bombing outside a polio centre in Quetta's Satellite Town area earlier this year [2016] killed 14 people including 13 policemen.[Byline: Syed Ali Shah]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org> [From the text stating ""the virus detected in Quetta and Pishin was not indigenous, rather it belonged to Jacobabad and Afghanistan's Kandahar province,"" one presumes that it is referring to a wild poliovirus, but it could be a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus. More information on the type of poliovirus identified in the environmental samples would be welcomed.The identification of poliovirus -- either WPV or cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) -- is an indication of pockets of susceptibles (unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated persons) in an area who are infected with the virus and serve to continue the transmission cycle amongst other susceptibles. While it is convenient to ""blame"" the isolate on importations, the realities in an area are that if the virus is isolated, there is an infected individual in the area. And if 5 out of 27 samples were positive, it strongly suggests that there is continued circulation of the virus in the areas from where the samples were taken.Quetta is the capital of Balochistan province. It is located in northwestern Balochistan near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and serves as a trade and communication hub between the countries. Pishin is the capital of Pishin district of Balochistan, also in the northwest of the province, and is located near the border with Afghanistan, serving as a connection between Quetta and Afghanistan.

This is the 2nd instance of the virus being discovered in the city in 5 months; a polio-derived vaccine virus was earlier found in April 2016 in the Amberpet nala. [A nala is a dry riverbed or ravine in India, but in this case refers to a storm water drainage canal. - Mod.MPP]Following the latest find of the virus, the government's family welfare department has sent out an alert to all state-run and private hospitals to inform the government if they come across any polio cases, the Deccan Chronicle reports.The presence of the vaccine-derived virus in the environment is a cause of concern as it means that the virus can strike again and there can be polio cases.A senior doctor said: ""It's a major cause of concern for Hyderabad. Earlier it was found only in one nala, in Amberpet. But now it has been found in 2 nalas, which gives an indication that somewhere some children have been missed (being vaccinated) or the immunity has not built up. The existence of the virus in the environment means that the polio virus is still around, and surveillance at ground level must improve."" In the last session, more than one lakh [greater than 100 000] children were administered polio vaccines again.Despite that, the 2 nalas have shown presence of the virus, which has the authorities worried. The health department has been asked to also survey the migrant population, as they are often left out from these programs as they travel from one place to another.[Byline: Renu Ratheesh]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As India had interrupted transmission of the WPV in 2011, the isolation of cVDPV2 in the country is of concern as it serves as an indicator that there are pockets of susceptibles that are sustaining transmission of the cVDPV2 in Hyderabad. Hopefully, this is serving as a reminder of the importance to maintain high levels of vaccination coverage.At the ICID (International Congress on Infectious Diseases) held in Hyderabad India in March 2016, there was mention that the transition to IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) was delayed, but the transition to phasing out the OPV2 (oral poliovirus vaccine type 2) component would proceed on time, with the hope that there weren't cVDPV2 viruses in the country. The identification of the cVDPV2 in different nalas in Hyderabad is disturbing. We await further information on control measures being implemented in the area.Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state.

Similar approaches to outbreak response were successfully implemented in previous years in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.- A campaign in Borno and surrounding states was conducted this week, including with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) co-administered with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) in key areas. Strong community turnout was reported, with high levels of acceptance rates.- Insecurity and inaccessibility continue to hamper efforts in some areas, while operational challenges continue to be addressed, such as improving training of health workers.Lake Chad sub-region- The recent detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Borno state, Nigeria, poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad sub-region, and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Health leaders at last month's [August 2016] Regional Committee for Africa declared the situation to be a regional public health emergency for the Lake Chad sub-region.- A regional outbreak response is currently ongoing to reach more than 10 million children across Central African Republic, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon. The activity is being coordinated and planned across all countries, with particular focus on sharing of data and focus on population movements. Some areas are currently inaccessible due to a combination of insecurity and flooding due to the rainy season.West Africa- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016.
