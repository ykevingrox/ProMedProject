Healthy persons infected with _Salmonella_ often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with _Salmonella_ can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (that is, infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.The recalled ""Kahuku Ogo"", ""Robusta Ogo"", and ""Kahuku Sea Asparagus"" were distributed mainly in Hawaii to Seafood and Produce Distributors through direct delivery, but also to some customers in [California, Washington, Nevada], and Tokyo Japan, and retailed at local Farmers Markets in Hawaii.The Ogo products come in a plastic bag of various weights from 0.5 lb to 35 lb, which were sold from 2 Nov 2016 and prior, and the Sea Asparagus in 4 oz, 1 lb clear plastic clamshell or in a 5 lb of plastic bag marked with a tracking number stamped on the lids or bags, which were sold from 8 Nov 2016 and prior.
