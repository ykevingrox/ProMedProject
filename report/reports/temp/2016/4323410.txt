The News (Pakistan) [edited]<https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/132178-Naegleria-fowleri-claims-years-first-life-in-city>Infection by _Naegleria_, a lethal infection caused by the ""brain-eating"" amoeba _Naegleria fowleri_, reportedly claimed the 1st life in the city this year [2016], while another person died of dengue hemorrhagic fever at a private hospital this week.With the rise in mercury level and change in other environmental factors, the weather conditions have become favourable for the growth of pathogens, and public health experts fear the outbreak of deadly infectious diseases, including naegleriasis, dengue, malaria and gastroenteritis.On Friday [1 Jun 2016], Sindh health department officials confirmed that 30-year-old ZK, son of AW, a resident of the Noor Muhammad Goth in Gadap Town, was taken to the Liaquat National Hospital in precarious condition. He, however, died at the hospital's Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during medical treatment.As per details, ZK is the 1st victim of the brain-eating infection this year [2016], which has claimed dozens of lives in previous years in Karachi and the rest of Sindh.According to health experts, primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by the freshwater amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_, which activates during warm weather and can prove fatal when it enters into the human brain through the nasal cavity.Zafar Mehdi, an official of the Sindh health department, confirmed that ZK died of the brain infection caused by _Naegleria fowleri_. He added that poor chlorination of water was the main reason behind the presence of the lethal microorganisms in water being supplied to Karachiites.Public health experts believe that Keenjhar Lake, which is the main water supply source to Karachi, is the biggest reservoir of _Naegleria fowleri_, and the only way to prevent citizens of Karachi from becoming sick was to add chlorine to the water before supplying it to them.Sindh health department officials claimed that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) was not adding any chlorine to the water. They advised people to use chlorine tablets or bleaching powder to disinfect the water for their domestic usage, including making ablution.They also advised against swimming in the pools, which had not been chlorinated, as _Naegleria fowleri_ could enter into their brains through the nasal cavity and could cause serious damage to their nervous systems.[Byline: M. Waqar Bhatti]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_Naegleria fowleri_ and other free-living amoebae are distributed ubiquitously in tropical and temperate areas. Therefore, the notion that their presence is related to the ambient temperature may not be correct.There are very sparse data on the effects of chlorination on survival of free-living amoebae. One study found that a chlorine concentration of 5 mg per liter gave a log3 reduction in _Acanthamoeba_ (Mogoa E et al. _Acanthamoeba castellanii_: cellular changes induced by chlorination. Exp Parasitol. 2010;126:97-102).Please refer to the comment in the 3 Sep 2014 ProMED-mail posting of a similar case from Pakistan (archive no 20140903.2746573), which describes ""the religious rite of ablution included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called wudu, or ablution. It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer, according to CDC. The deadly parasite has also been contracted via the use of neti pots. These practices, where water is introduced into the sinuses, is an obvious route of infection with _Naegleria fowleri_.""It is important to emphasize that water used for these rituals should be boiled before use. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/43130>.]
