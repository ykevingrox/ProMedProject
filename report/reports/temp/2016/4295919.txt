JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; there is no indication of whether the affected individual above had been vaccinated, but they probably had not been, at least recently. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.Maps of Taiwan can be seen at <http://www.tmf.org.tw/index.php/maps-taiwan-overall-english-cd> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3390>. - Mod.TY]
