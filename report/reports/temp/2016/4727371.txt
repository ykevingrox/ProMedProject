Everyone who is a current or legal resident who has an [equine] animal from now on must vaccinate them against VEE.ICA declared a health emergency due to the presence of Venezuelan equine encephalitis, VEE, in Cesar department, a measure due to the detection of 13 foci of the disease that was identified by ICA in 7 municipalities of the department, a measure that was made effective through ICA Resolution 18924 of December 2016.This declared health emergency permits ICA to strengthen the contingency plan for this disease, reinforcing vaccination of horses, donkeys and mules in the affected areas, as well as nearby areas, and epidemiological surveillance, actions aimed at containing the sanitary problem that puts at risk equine animals and the population of those [people] in contact with ill animals in Cesar department.Bosconia, Codazzi, El Copey, Valledupar, CurumanÌ , BecerrÌ l and La Paz are the affected municipalities and those in which ICA decreed the prohibition of movement of entry and exit of horses, mules and donkeys as well as special measures for persons who work in the affected properties.The measures that ICA has established to control the emergency are:- Quarantine of the intervened areas, the taking of samples for the laboratory, massive vaccination of equine animals, alliances with [producer] associations, health secretariats and people who are current or legal residents for vaccination. ICA will carry out the supervision of application of the vaccine and control of movement of animals.- Vaccination must be carried out according to the vaccine management and coverage protocols in the different affected areas and those at risk, in which are included as a priority those that border other departments as defined by epidemiological studies.ICA invites all agricultural and livestock producers who have equine animals to be attentive to changes in behavior of their animals, such as grinding of their teeth, nervous behavior, paralysis, blindness, circling movements, among others, and notify the nearest ICA office or the municipal authorities.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[VEE epizootics and epidemics (often termed epizoodemics) can be explosive, with large numbers of equine cases and spill-over into human populations as well. Equine case fatality rates can reach 80 percent, with surviving animals suffering neurological sequelae. Although human case fatalities are low, less than one percent, in major outbreaks, large numbers of ill people can fill local hospitals. Equine animals are the amplifying hosts, and as one medical epidemiologist put it: ""When you are out of susceptible horses, you are out of disease.""VEE outbreaks are sporadic, and years may elapse between occurrence of cases. That absence may lull animal owners into a sense of false security and cause them to neglect to maintain routine VEE vaccination. VEE virus subtype ID is maintained in foci in rodents and transmitted among them by _Culex_ (_Melanoconion_) subgenus mosquitoes. Studies have shown that a mutation of a single base pair of the subtype ID virus RNA can convert the virus into subtype 1AB or I C with transmission among equine animals and to humans by several species of mosquitoes. Humans are dead-end hosts.ReferenceScott C. Weaver, Cristina Ferro, Roberto Barrera, Jorge Boshell, and Juan-Carlos Navarro. Venezuelan equine encephalitis. 2003.
