A white membrane was visible covering the tissue of uvula, soft palate, and pharynx. She was referred from Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu with a diagnosis of pharyngeal diphtheria to STIDH for administration of diphtheria antitoxin. She is currently under treatment at STIDH.The greatest number of diphtheria cases are usually seen in children aged less than 15 years. Diphtheria cases as seen in this young adult female are rare. However, there need to be more studies to determine whether there has been shifting in the age distribution of diphtheria cases over the past years, as described elsewhere [1].Reference---------1.

Euro Surveill. 1997; 2(8): pii=127; available at <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=127>.--Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research Unit, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions.Diphtheria occurs worldwide, but is now uncommon in developed countries. From 1980 through 2011, 55 cases of diphtheria were reported in the United States, an average of 1 or 2 per year (range, 0-5 cases per year). Only 5 cases have been reported since 2000. When diphtheria was more common, it most frequently affected children in many countries, including the US, before 1935. Once called ""the strangling angel of children,"" diphtheria was a dreaded common childhood illness (<http://www.drgreene.com/articles/diphtheria/>). At that time, at least 40 percent of diphtheria cases were among children younger than 5 years of age, and some 70 percent of the cases were among children younger than 15 years of age (<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=127>); in the 1920s there were an estimated 100 000 to 200 000 cases of diphtheria per year in the United States, with 13 000 to 15 000 deaths (ProMED-mail post Diphtheria - Latvia 20151208.3848321).However, of the 53 reported cases in the US since 1980 with known patient age, 34 (64 percent) were in persons 20 years of age or older; 41 percent of cases were among persons 40 years of age or older. Most of these cases occurred in unimmunized or inadequately immunized persons. The shift in the age distribution of diphtheria cases has usually been explained by the impact of childhood immunization. However, historical data show that a shift of the disease to older ages began before mass immunization was introduced (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/181/Supplement_1/S2.full>). The explanation for the shift in the age of patients remains unanswered.Maps of Nepal can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_Federal_States> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46077>.
