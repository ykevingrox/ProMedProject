Invasive infections with _Mycobacterium chimaera_ were reported in patients with previous open chest surgery and exposure to contaminated heater-cooler units (HCUs). We present results of the surveillance of clinical cases and of contaminated HCUs as well as environmental investigations in Germany up until February 2016. Clinical infections occurred in 5 male German cases over 50 years of age (range 53-80). Cases had been exposed to HCUs from one single manufacturer during open chest surgery up to 5 years prior to onset of symptoms. During environmental investigations, _M. chimaera_ was detected in samples from used HCUs from 3 different countries and samples from new HCUs as well as in the environment at the manufacturing site of one manufacturer in Germany. Our investigation suggests that at least some of the _M. chimaera_ infections may have been caused by contamination of HCUs at manufacturing site. We recommend that until sustainable measures for safe use of HCUs in operation theatres are implemented, users continue to adhere to instructions for use of HCUs and Field Safety Notices issued by the manufacturer, implement local monitoring for bacterial contamination and continuously check the websites of national and European authorities for current recommendations for the safe operation of HCUs.Introduction------------In July 2014, the Federal Office of Public Health Switzerland (FOPH) reported about patients with _Mycobacterium chimaera_ infections, who had previously undergone open-chest heart surgery with exposure to contaminated heater-cooler units (HCUs) [1]. Several other reports and publications have suggested since that HCUs produced by one manufacturer in Germany may be a source of _M. chimaera_ infections that occurred in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom [2-5].HCUs are commonly used in cardiac surgery during extracorporeal circulation in order to regulate the temperature of the blood and to provide temperature-controlled water for cardioplegia. HCUs have water tanks that provide temperature-controlled water to external heat exchangers. Since _M. chimaera_ was detected in air samples close to operating HCUs, airborne transmission is believed to be the most likely transmission mechanism in the _M. chimaera_ cases after open chest surgery [4,6]._M. chimaera_ is a slow-growing nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) belonging to the _M. avium_ complex (MAC). It was 1st reported by Tortoli et al. in 2004 as a closely to _M. intracellulare_-related distinct species [7]. Identification requires molecular diagnostic testing [8]. _M. chimaera_ may cause lung infections especially in patients with underlying lung disease as well as disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients and was found in skin and bone infections. In the environment, it was identified in biofilms and detected in water sources such as household water [9].Among others, the report by the FOPH about the outbreak investigations in Switzerland and the reports about cases in Germany and the Netherlands led to increased surveillance efforts and outbreak investigations in Europe [3,10]. Here we present the results of the surveillance of clinical cases, of the surveillance of contaminated HCUs and of environmental investigations in Germany.Discussion----------We present data that show that _M. chimaera_ was isolated in clinical samples from (i) infected patients in Germany who had undergone open chest surgery, (ii) in samples from used HCUs from 3 different countries and (iii) in samples from new HCUs and the environment at the manufacturing site of one manufacturer. This suggests that at least some of the 5 German cases with _M. chimaera_ infection may have occurred due to contamination of the HCUs by _M. chimaera_ at the manufacturing site.Preliminary typing results indicate that the _M. chimaera_ isolates detected by the authorities and the isolates from the manufacturer appear to be almost identical (unpublished data). The _M. chimaera_-positive environmental samples at the manufacturing site prompted the manufacturer to modify the manufacturing process, which now includes ethanol disinfection and an active drying of the HCU water circuit before shipment. When the Bavarian regulatory authorities conducted onsite visits, no _M. chimaera_-positive sample was recovered except from a used HCU, which had been disassembled for decontamination. The returned unit had been manufactured before August 2014.According to the information provided by the manufacturer, HCUs manufactured before mid-August 2014 may have had environmental mycobacteria presence in the unit at the time of delivery. Our investigations could not elucidate if and until when contaminated HCUs may have been delivered to customers from this manufacturer.As of end of March 2016, 2 additional notifications of patients with _M. chimaera_-positive clinical specimens are under investigation in Germany. Until now we could not obtain data on all surgical interventions prior the _M. chimaera_ diagnosis of these patients.A limitation of our study is that we did not conduct active case finding. It is likely that the passive surveillance has led to an underestimation of the actual number of cases of _M. chimaera_ infections in Germany. Furthermore, the true number of cases is probably underestimated since there is no typical clinical picture for infections with _M. chimaera_. Patients present with nonspecific symptoms, a variety of infection sites and a culture for mycobacteria is usually not part of a routine diagnostic work-up in patients presenting with signs of infection._M. chimaera_ was not the only bacterial species isolated from HCUs. Contamination of HCUs with other bacteria was reported from various cardiac surgery centres in Germany. Furthermore, bacteria were also isolated from HCUs produced by other manufacturers. It is possible that some of the cases were infected due to contamination of HCUs at the cardiac surgery centres. It is also possible that some of the cases occurred due to exposure to HCUs produced by other manufacturers.Infections by _M. chimaera_ are rare and their occurrence, when detected, is considered unusual [19]. The reported _M. chimaera_ infections might therefore be regarded as an indicator of a potential microbial hazard caused by the water-bearing HCUs in the healthcare environment.Further investigations are needed to differentiate between the risk of _M. chimaera_ infection from HCUs contaminated at the manufacturing site, the risk of infection from HCUs contaminated during use and the risk of infection from other medical devices that include an HCU such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenators [20]. In 2 recent publications, GÌ¦tting et al. and Sommerstein et al. gave interesting insights into possible mechanisms of airborne transmission by HCUs [4,6]. In the cases described here, NGS [next generation sequencing, i.e., determining the sequence of nucleotides within the DNA molecule] should help determine the fraction that may be due to contamination at the manufacturing site or during use at the cardiac surgery centres.To allow for targeted public health action, it is important that manufacturers of medical products share the findings of their own investigations into bacterial contamination, as demonstrated in this outbreak investigation. Sharing the results by the manufacturer, as well as information on the implemented corrective measures, allowed us to better understand the risks involved in HCU use. Regulatory authorities in Germany are continuing their information exchange with the manufacturers that produce HCUs to provide a sustainable solution for minimising the risks of infection in patients exposed to HCUs.Conclusions-----------We present evidence on _M. chimaera_ detection in clinical samples from infected German patients having been exposed to HCUs produced by the same manufacturer, in 3 cardiac surgery centres, in samples from used HCUs from 3 different countries and in samples from new HCUs and the environment at the manufacturing site of one manufacturer. In summary, this suggests a point source for the reported _M. chimaera_ infections and for _M. chimaera_-positive samples from HCUs and the environment. Notifications of contaminated HCUs of different manufacturers and with various bacteria, indicate a general problem with water-bearing systems in the healthcare environment.We recommend that until sustainable measures for a safe use of HCUs in operation theatres are implemented, users continue to adhere to the instructions for use of the HCU and the Field Safety Notices issued by the manufacturer, implement a local monitoring for bacterial contamination of the HCUs and continuously check the websites of relevant national and European authorities for current recommendations for the safe operation of HCUs.[The full article, including the methods, results, tables and references, is available at the source URL.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A previous ProMED-mail post on this multi-country outbreak referred to an article published by Swiss investigators at the University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich Heart Institute in March 2015 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases (1)._Mycobacterium chimaera_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) (NTM is a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex) in the _Mycobacterium avium intracellulare_ complex (MAC). _M. chimaera_ is a slowly growing acid-fast bacillus that is commonly found in the environmental water and soil (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/6/3/266.full.pdf+html>). Because of its close relationship to _M. intracellulare_, _M. chimaera_ strains can be misidentified as _M. intracellulare_. _M. chimaera_ is known to cause pulmonary disease, but until the reports from Switzerland (1, 2), _M. chimaera_ had not been reported as a cause of bloodstream infection or prosthetic valve endocarditis. The German cases presented in the Eurosurveillance article above had spondylodiscitis following coronary artery bypass grafting in 1 patient and valvular endocarditis following aortic valve replacement in 4 cases, complicated by paravalvular leak, paravalvular abscess, or cerebral abscesses.References:1.
