Male-to-Male Sexual Transmission of Zika Virus -- Texas, January 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Zika virus infection has been linked to increased risk for Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome and adverse fetal outcomes, including congenital microcephaly. In January 2016, after notification from a local health care provider, an investigation by Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) identified a case of sexual transmission of Zika virus between a man with recent travel to an area of active Zika virus transmission (patient A) and his nontraveling male partner (patient B). At this time, there had been one prior case report of sexual transmission of Zika virus. The present case report indicates Zika virus can be transmitted through anal sex, as well as vaginal sex. Identification and investigation of cases of sexual transmission of Zika virus in nonendemic areas present valuable opportunities to inform recommendations to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report adds a new dimension to Zika virus transmission. Public information by the medical community is an essential measure for prevention of transmission. Because many individuals who are infected with Zika virus are unaware of it, the need to take precautions to avoid sexual transmission may not occur to them.A map of the USA showing the location of Texas can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Heterosexual transmissionDate: Wed 13 Apr 2016Source: The New England Journal of Medicine DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1604449 [edited]<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1604449>Eric D'Ortenzio, M.D., Sophie Matheron, M.D., Xavier de Lamballerie, M.D., Ph.D., Bruno Hubert, M.D., GÌ©raldine Piorkowski, Ph.D., Marianne Maquart, Ph.D., Diane Des camps, M.D., Ph.D.,Florence Damond, Pharm.D., Ph.D., Yazdan Yazdanpanah, M.D., Ph.D., Isabelle Leparc-Goffart, Ph.D. Evidence of Sexual Transmission of Zika Virus.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2 studies have shown the presence of infectious ZIKV [Zika virus] in semen. A recent article described detection of ZIKV RNA in semen 62 days after the onset of illness, but infectious virus was not cultured.We report a case of ZIKV infection in a previously healthy 24-year-old woman (Patient 1) who was living in Paris and in whom acute fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and pruritic rash developed on 20 Feb 2016. She was not receiving any medication, had not received any blood transfusions, and had never traveled to a region where Zika was epidemic or to tropical or subtropical areas. Her last trip outside France was to Okinawa, Japan, from 21 Dec 2015 to 1 Jan 2016. A clinical examination on 23 Feb [2016] showed a maculopapular rash on the patient's abdomen, arms, and legs and a temperature of 36.6 C. The illness lasted approximately 7 days.Patient 1 reported sexual contact between 11-20 Feb 2016, with a man (Patient 2, the index patient) who had stayed in Brazil from 11 Dec 2015 through 9 Feb 2016. The sexual contact involved 7 episodes of both vaginal sexual intercourse, without ejaculation and without the use of a condom, and oral sex with ejaculation.Patient 2, a 46-year-old man, reported fever, asthenia, myalgia, chills, and a cutaneous rash that began on 7 Feb [2016], while he was in Rio de Janeiro. The symptoms had resolved on the day he arrived in France on 10 Feb [2016]. The clinical examination of Patient 2 was normal on 23 Feb [2016].Populations of _Aedes aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes are not established in the city of Paris. Moreover, in France, the diapause period of _Aedes_ species extends from December to May.3 days after the onset of her symptoms, on 23 Feb [2016], samples of urine and saliva were obtained from Patient 1. The urine sample tested positive for ZIKV RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a viral count of 3.5 x 10^3 copies per milliliter, and the saliva tested positive at a viral count of 2.1 x 10^4 copies per milliliter. A plasma sample tested negative for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR, but serum IgM antibodies to ZIKV were detected. A vaginal swab obtained on 1 Mar [2016] was negative for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR.In Patient 2, a urine sample obtained 16 days after the onset of symptoms tested positive for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR with a viral count of 4 x 10^3 copies per milliliter, but plasma and saliva samples tested negative. The 1st and 2nd urine stream samples obtained on day 24 were positive for ZIKV RNA with a viral count of 2.1 x 10^4 copies per milliliter. Semen samples tested positive for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR with a high viral load of 2.9 x 10^8 copies per milliliter in the sample obtained on day 18 and 3.5 x 10^7 copies per milliliter in the sample obtained on day 24. ZIKV was isolated by means of culture from semen samples on days 18 and 24. These data support the hypothesis of sexual transmission (either oral or vaginal) of ZIKV from Patient 2 to Patient 1. We cannot rule out the possibility that transmission occurred not through semen but through other biologic fluids, such as pre-ejaculate secretions or saliva exchanged through deep kissing. The saliva of Patient 2 tested negative on day 10 after the onset of his symptoms, but it was not tested earlier. ZIKV has been detected in saliva, but, to our knowledge, no cases of transmission through saliva have been documented.The current outbreaks of ZIKV infection should be an opportunity to conduct studies to understand the natural history of ZIKV. We need to better define recommendations to prevent transmission of the virus. In particular, guidelines regarding how long men who are returning from an area where active ZIKV transmission is occurring should continue to use condoms during sexual contact with pregnant women and those of child-bearing age are lacking. In addition, recommendations regarding the possibility of oral transmission of the virus through semen are needed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The need for prospective studies of persistence of Zika virus in bodily fluids, including semen, is important in order to make sound recommendations for prevention.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>; and of France at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
