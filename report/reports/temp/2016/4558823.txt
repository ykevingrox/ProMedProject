According to the Robert Koch-Institute, the federal institute for public health and communicable diseases, to which TBE is a notifiable disease, the main endemic areas are located in southern Germany, mainly in the federal states of Bavaria and Baden-WÌ rttemberg and in some districts of the federal states of Hessen, Thuringia and Rhineland-Palatinate.In the Federal State of Saxony only 1 district at the frontier to Czech Republic and the Federal State of Bavaria (both known TBE risk areas) is considered a risk area for TBE as defined by the Robert Koch-Institute.In 2016, the number of reported TBE cases so far is above the average (305 cases on 10 Oct 2016, total annual medium number since 2001: 221 human cases). In the actual transmission period, human TBE cases have been frequently reported from unusual (that is, non-endemic) areas with no recent history of endemic TBE.We report on 1 human case, which most likely was infected during blueberry collecting in a forest in the district of Northern Saxony. To confirm the natural TBE focus, ticks were collected at the location of tick acquisition by flagging 6 weeks after the patient was bitten by an infected tick, presumably an _Ixodes (I.) ricinus_ nymph according to the patient's description. We collected 816 adult _Dermacentor reticulatus_ ticks (314 males, 502 females) and 114 _I. ricinus_ (90 nymphs, 12 females and 12 males). Testing of ticks for TBE viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR revealed a total of 5 positive _D. reticulatus_ pools (1 female pool and 4 male pools; minimal infection rate (MIR) of females 0.2 per cent, MIR of males 1.3 per cent) and 1 _I. ricinus_ pool of 12 nymphs (MIR of all _I. ricinus_ 0.9 per cent; MIR of _I. ricinus_ nymphs 1.1 per cent).TBE viral RNA in questing _D. reticulatus_ ticks so far has been reported only from Poland (Biernat 2014, 2016). Successful transmission of TBE virus via _D. reticulatus_ nymphs to susceptible mice however had been previously demonstrated experimentally (Kozuch and Nosek, 1971; Nosek et al. 1984), but its impact under natural circumstances remains to be defined.We report for the 1st time the detection of TBE viral RNA in _D. reticulatus_ ticks in Germany. This finding is of great medical importance as it adds a new TBE natural focus in an area where TBE was not expected. This is also the 1st evidence in Germany that in a natural focus with sympatric occurrence of both tick species (_D. reticulatus_, _I. ricinus_), TBE virus was found in _D. reticulatus_. As _D. reticulatus_ has a different activity period than _I. ricinus_, this could mean that the risk of infection in natural foci with _D. reticulatus_ expands to the winter months and therefore transmission of TBE virus in such areas might occur the year around.The detection of TBV viral RNA in this tick species raises many further questions about a possible role of _D. reticulatus_ in the natural transmission cycle of TBE virus, including the overwintering of the virus. The role of _D. reticulatus_ also for the transmission of TBE virus to humans and for the phylogenetics and the virulence of TBE virus has to be studied.References:Biernat B, Karbowiak G, Stanczak J, Masny A, Werszko J.

It has a high reproduction rate, a rapid developmental cycle, and is also able to overcome years of unfavourable conditions. _D. reticulatus_ can survive under water for several months and is cold-hardy even compared to other tick species. It has a wide host range: over 60 different wild and domesticated hosts are known for the 3 active developmental stages. Its high adaptiveness gives an edge to this tick species as shown by new data on the emergence and establishment of _D. reticulatus_ populations throughout Europe.(Excerpted from: FÌ¦ldvÌÁri G, et al. Dermacentor reticulatus: a vector on the rise. Parasit Vectors. 2016; 9: 314. doi:10.1186/s13071-016-1599-x <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4888597/>)Tickborne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by 1 of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian Spring-Summer Encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks.Usually symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after being bitten by an infected tick. Symptoms can last up to 8 days and include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. Approximately 1/3rd of patients develop severe symptoms after the 1st phase of the illness where the virus causes meningitis (attacks the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord) and/or encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Second phase symptoms include stiff neck, fever, headache, nausea, sensitivity to light, confusion, disorientation, drowsiness, behavioural changes, seizures, and paralysis. Some patients may experience long-term complications such as memory loss, speech and language problems, mood disorders, epilepsy, fatigue, and motor skill difficulties. Treatment of the acute infection includes supportive care of symptoms.(Excerpted from <https://www.iamat.org/country/germany/risk/tick-borne-encephalitis>)Tickborne encephalitis (TBE, Central European Type) is a relatively rare neurologic disease with about 100 to 200 reported cases in Baden-WÌ rttemberg annually. Fatal outcomes are described and therapy is only symptomatic. However, an effective vaccine is available against TBE virus.Tickborne diseases and their causative agents are not distributed evenly in Germany, but are restricted to so-called natural foci which are based mainly on the presence of an infective cycle of the pathogen between the vector (ticks) and their natural hosts (rodents, deer). The knowledge of the location and intensity of these risk areas is important for the recommendation of prophylactic measures. (Partly extracted from Oehme R, et al.
