The ENHS is designed to investigate the range of health complications being experienced by EVD survivors after they have recovered from the disease.According to the Co-Principal Investigator of the Cohort Sub-study, Dr. Sia Watta Camanor, who spoke during the Ministry of Information regular press briefing at the ministry in Monrovia on Thu [12 May 2016], the investigation will also determine if EVD survivors can infect others through sexual intercourse or whether a pregnant survivor can transmit the virus to her unborn child during birth.According to Camanor, the purpose of the birth cohort is to record birth information, collect cord blood and placenta samples for virological studies.She added the cohort is also to access developmental milestones, measure antibody levels for children born to EVD survivors, and to determine the presence of the Ebola virus in breast milk.Camanor stated that every pregnant EVD survivor is assigned to a field tracker who does the follow-up in collaboration with clinic trackers, up to the pregnancy outcome.She also said an Antenatal Care (ANC) Certified midwife (Cm) does the medical assessment, but refers to a physician in the case of a complication.Camanor noted, in the case of an emergency, an ambulance system is put in place at the 8th month, and the team verifies the signing of the protocol that allows the collection of samples during delivery. She stated if the outcome is positive, the child is enrolled into birth cohort within 1 week after a delivery follow-up visit in 6 months.]11 May 2016 Sierra Leone's baby boom: An unpleasant legacy of Ebola outbreak<http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2016/05/sierra-leones-baby-boom-an-unpleasant-legacy-of-ebola-outbreak.html?asset_id=6a00d83451bd6d69e201b8d1e2c231970c>[The outbreak which virtually brought life in the west African country to a standstill, also left in its wake a growing number of young expectant mothers. Teenage pregnancy is not a particularly new phenomenon in Sierra Leone, but the outbreak of what was a deadly epidemic led to a doubling of a situation the country has had to grapple with for some time.According to Josephine Samba, a midwife at the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital in Greetown, ""The teenage pregnancy is very high. More when the Ebola breakout was. There was an Ebola breakout so most of them were at home. They never go to school so there was a problem. There was no school at that time so everything was just upside down. So everybody was doing -- more the teenagers -- they were just roaming about socializing.""][In addition, there are household members in flux, sometimes leading to predatory males raping their young-girl charges or forcing them into prostitution -- which sometimes led to pregnancy -- in exchange for room and board.]12 May 2016 Sierra Leone's 1st Ebola-hit community reconsiders its traditions<http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/sierra-leone-s-first-ebola-hit-community-reconsiders-its-traditions/article/465151>[The Kailahun district was the 1st in Sierra Leone to record cases back in May 2014 after the initial outbreak in southern Guinea.Things that have changed in Sierra Leone:- Prevention in the form of better hygiene is highly visible in the proliferation of hand-washing stations at the string of villages along this rural district.- Another influential group has altered its activities post-Ebola in Kailahun: the female secret societies that dominate rural life in this part of west Africa, whose primary role is to initiate girls into womanhood. Traditionally they would carry out female genital mutilation (FGM), a practice performed on 90 percent of girls in Sierra Leone, according to UNICEF. But in 19-year-old Baindu one village, they have stopped. ""(Families) are afraid, so there is less trust in the societies,"" she said. The girls' loss of blood during the excision, usually performed with a razor, was now known to be a possible transmission point for Ebola, medical professionals in the community.- The Red Cross sought to engage the healers in the fight against [Ebola virus disease (EVD)], persuading some to advise visitors that they could not cure Ebola, and pointing them to dedicated treatment centers.Things that have not changed:Ostracizing EVD survivors. The stigma of EVD remains a problem, and survivors have held protests in recent months against the government, claiming free follow-up treatment and scholarships for their children have not been delivered as promised.]Research--------10 May 2016: Management of infections in critically ill returning travelers in the intensive care unit (I): Considerations on infection control and transmission of resistance<http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712%2816%2931036-0/abstract>[Citation: Rello J, Rodriguez-Morales AJ, Rossolini GM, et al.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.04.019Highlights- Person-to-Person is the most important way of transmission.- By far, the most important cause of death remains malaria.- Surveillance strategies based on epidemiological data (country visited, duration of travel and time elapsed after returning) and clinical syndromes associated with systematic search policy are usually mandatory to limit the risk of outbreak.- Single bed-room hospitalization and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule waiting the laboratory results.AbstractDepending on their destinations and activities, international travelers are at a significant risk of contracting both communicable and non-communicable diseases. On their return to their home countries, many require intensive care. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corononavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and more recently Ebola hemorrhagic fever have highlighted the risks, and other well-known communicable pathogens such as MRSA or Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been previously described. However, malaria remains by far the most important cause of death. Here we review issues of imported antibiotic resistance and protection from highly contagious disease. Surveillance strategies based on epidemiological data (country visited, duration of travel and time elapsed after returning) and clinical syndromes together with systematic search policies are usually mandatory to limit the risk of outbreak. Single bed-room hospitalization and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule while awaiting the laboratory results. Because person-to-person contact is the main route of transmission, health care workers should implement specific prevention strategies.]11 May 2016: NIH doctors describe severe case of Ebola virus disease<http://www.mdlinx.com/emergency-medicine/medical-news-article/2016/05/11/6643235/>[For more than a month in 2015, a multidisciplinary team including infectious disease and critical care physicians and nurses, respiratory therapists and other specialists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) treated a critically ill patient who had contracted Ebola virus disease in Sierra Leone. A new report by the medical caregivers details the clinical course of the 34-year-old American healthcare worker who was admitted to the NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit on day 7 of his illness. The patient survived his illness with intensive supportive care, despite multi-organ failure. In addition to declines in kidney and liver function, the patient experienced severe neuromuscular weakness that led to respiratory failure, and he required mechanical ventilation for 10 days. Complications also included meningoencephalitis, a frequently fatal condition involving inflammation of the brain and meningeal tissue, the protective outer layers of the brain and spinal column. On day 33 of the patient's illness, when he no longer was shedding virus, doctors performed MRI scans and detected multiple sites of tissue damage (lesions) in both the brain and spinal column, consistent with the multiple nervous system abnormalities experienced by the patient during his illness. Meningoencephalitis has been previously described as a complication of Ebola virus infection, but, the NIH doctors note, the new report is the 1st to include MRI findings and a detailed physical examination of a patient who received supportive care only. Ultimately, the patient survived his illness. When examined 7 months after his hospital admission, almost all of his neurological abnormalities had disappeared, and MRIs showed that most of the previously seen lesions had resolved.This report highlights that sequential organ failure may occur in patients with severe Ebola virus disease despite meticulous attention to fluid and electrolyte balances, and that near complete recovery is possible with intensive-level supportive care alone.Citation: Chertow DS, Natha A, Suffredini, et al.

Kristin J. Cummings, M.D., M.P.H., from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Morgantown, West Virginia, and colleagues describe infection-control measures implemented at a Texas hospital, which was the 1st US community hospital to care for a patient with [Ebola virus disease (EVD)].The researchers note that a multidisciplinary team from the CDC joined the hospital's infection preventionists after admission of the 1st EVD patient, in order to implement occupational safety and health controls for direct patient care, handling of clinical specimens, and management of regulated medical waste. The team strengthened existing engineering and administrative controls. In addition, personal protective equipment (PPE) ensemble was standardized, health care professionals were trained in PPE use, and there was implementation of a system of trained observers supervising PPE use. Considerable demands are placed on a community hospital when caring for patients with EVD.""The experiences of the authors and others informed national policies for the care of patients with EVD and protection of health care personnel, including new guidance for PPE, a rapid system for deploying CDC staff to assist hospitals ('Ebola Response Team'), and a framework for a tiered approach to hospital preparedness,"" the authors write.]13 May 2016: IBM Creates A Molecule That Could Destroy All VirusesCooperative Orthogonal Macromolecular Assemblies with Broad Spectrum Antiviral Activity, High Selectivity, and Resistance Mitigation<http://www.popsci.com/macromolecule-developed-by-ibm-could-fight-multiple-viruses-at-once>[Citation: Ichiyama K, Yang C, Chandrasekaran L, et al. 13May2016. Cooperative Orthogonal Macromolecular Assemblies with Broad Spectrum Antiviral Activity, High Selectivity, and Resistance Mitigation. Macromolecules, 2016, 49 (7), pp 2618-2629 DOI: 10.1021/acs.macromol.6b00091AbstractTreatment of viral infections continues to be elusive owing to the variance in virus structure (RNA, DNA, and enveloped and nonenveloped viruses) together with their ability to rapidly mutate and garner resistance. Here we report a general strategy to prevent viral infection using multifunctional macromolecules that were designed to have mannose moieties that compete with viruses for immune cells, and basic amine groups that block viral entry through electrostatic interactions and prevent viral replication by neutralizing the endosomal pH. We showed that cells treated with the antiviral polymers inhibited TIM [T cell/transmembrane, immunoglobulin, and mucin] receptors from trafficking virus, likely from electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with EC50 values ranging from 2.6 to 6.8 mg/L, depending on the type of TIM receptors. Molecular docking computations revealed an unexpected, and general, specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with viral surface proteins, and virus and cell-binding assay demonstrated a significant reduction in infection after incubating virus or cells with the antiviral polymers. Moreover, the mannose-functionalized macromolecules effectively prevented the virus from infecting the immune cells. Representative viruses from each category -- including dengue, influenza, Chikungunya, Enterovirus 71, Ebola, Marburg, and herpes simplex -- were surveyed, and viral infection was effectively prevented at polymer concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/L with very high selectivity (greater-than 5000) over mammalian cells. The generality of these cooperative orthogonal interactions (electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding) provides broad-spectrum antiviral activity. As the antiviral mechanism is based on nonspecific supramolecular interactions between the amino acid residues and mannose/cationic moieties of the macromolecule, the ability to form the virus-polymer and polymer-cell assemblies can occur regardless of viral mutation, preventing drug resistance development.]13 May 2016: Formulating and improving care while mitigating risk in a military Ebola virus disease treatment unit<http://jramc.bmj.com/content/early/2016/05/13/jramc-2015-000615.short>[Citation: Lamb LE, Cox AT, Fletcher T, McCourt AL.

Publisher: BMJ Publishing Group Limited.AbstractThis paper describes the development of the UK military's Ebola Virus Disease Treatment Unit (EVD TU) that was deployed to Sierra Leone as part of the UK response to the West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in 2014 and 2015. It highlights specific challenges faced within this unique Field Hospital environment.The military EVD TU was initially established to provide confidence to international healthcare workers coming to Sierra Leone to assist in the international response to the EVD epidemic and formed a key part of the action plan by the UK's Department for International Development. It was designed and staffed to provide a high level of care to those admitted with suspected or confirmed EVD and was prepared to admit the 1st patient within 6 weeks of the original activation order by the Ministry of Defense. This article outlines the main hazards perceived at the outset of the operation and the methods used to mitigate the risk to the healthcare workers at the EVD TU. The article examines the mechanisms that enabled the hospital to respond positively to challenges that emerged during the deployment, while simultaneously reducing the risk to the healthcare workers involved in care delivery.]Vaccine-------13 May 2016: Promising Phase I Ebola trials<http://www.labnews.co.uk/news/promising-phase-ebola-trials-13-05-2016/>[Scientists involved in Phase I trials for an Ebola virus vaccine have described recent results as very promising.The trial is being led in Hamburg, with a total of 158 volunteers participating in Germany, Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya. They are being vaccinated with increased doses of the potential vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV. The vaccine is an attenuated, genetically modified strain of vesicular stomatitis virus, which presents a surface protein of the Ebola virus.Professor Marylyn Addo, from the German Centre for Infection Research at the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, said, ""The results for tolerability, safety, and the immune response to the vaccine candidate are very promising. With this, a single vaccine could provide lasting protection against Ebola.""From the Phase I trials, no serious vaccine-related adverse reactions were observed, but there were cases of temporary mild fever and some joint complaints. The antibodies produced by the vaccine were still detectable after 6 months.These results are being merged into other trials which are using a previously determined optimal vaccine dose and also focusing on testing children. The US Food and Drug Administration is seeking approval for an Ebola vaccine for early 2017.]Economy-------12 May 2016 Guinea: Ebola, commodity price fall cost Guinea USD 500 million in lost revenue<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3587906/Ebola-commodity-price-fall-cost-Guinea-500-mln-lost-revenue.html>[In 2015, after an outbreak of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] and the drop in global commodity prices, slowed growth and hurt the mining sector in Guinea, Prime Minister Mamady Youla said on Thu [12 May 2016].Mining is the main source of foreign exchange in Guinea, which holds nearly 1/3rd of the world's reserves of bauxite, the metal used to make aluminum.""In February 2011, the price of iron was USD 187 per ton,"" Youla said.
