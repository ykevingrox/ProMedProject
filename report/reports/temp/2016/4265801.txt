Web sources: Department of Health, Catalonia Media ECDC assessment ---------------------Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a major cause of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and is particularly prevalent in parts of Southeast Asia, affecting thousands of children and infants each year. EV-A71 infection is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. The illness is contagious during the acute stage and perhaps longer, as faecal shedding of the virus can continue for several weeks. Incubation period ranges from 3 to 7 days. It is the most neuropathogenic nonpolio enterovirus in humans, causing a variety of neurological diseases including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. Large outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Taiwan, Mainland China, Singapore, Australia. In Europe, EV-A71 commonly causes asymptomatic infection and is only occasionally associated with severe neuroinfection. The last epidemics of EV-A71 infection in Europe occurred during 1975 in Bulgaria with over 705 cases, of which 149 cases developed paralysis, and 44 deaths. Hungary experienced an outbreak of EVA71 in 1978 with 323 cases (13 poliomyelitis-like paralysis, 145 encephalitis, 161 aseptic meningitis, 4 hand, foot and mouth disease).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>
