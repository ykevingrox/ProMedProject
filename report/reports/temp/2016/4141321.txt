She had been travelling there for 6 weeks, with the last couple of weeks in the northern and northwestern parts. The patient did not have any symptoms before or during the travel back to Sweden [2 Mar 2016]. There were rumors of cases of Lassa fever in the area where she travelled and the patient had been staying in rooms with traces of mouse excreta. The travel partner did not experience any symptoms suggestive of Lassa fever.A week after her return to Sweden, she experienced onset of symptoms such as high fever, chills, joint pain, headache, diarrhoea, and occasional vomiting. She went to an outpatient clinic, but as neurological complications did appear, she was hospitalized [17 Mar 2016] at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg [VÌ stra GÌ¦taland County]. The medical examination showed signs of encephalitis and the suspicion/probability of Lassa virus infection was raised on [29 Mar 2016]. Serology and PCR-tests were performed at the Public Health Agency of Sweden [31 Mar 2016]. Serum samples were PCR-positive as well as positive for IgG and IgM against Lassa virus. Sequencing was consequently performed and confirmed the diagnosis [1 Apr 2016]. The sequence was in agreement with prior reported sequences from Liberia.The patient was the same day transferred to a specialized treatment center in LinkÌ¦ping University Hospital in appropriate isolation to prevent secondary transmission.During the hospital care up to the diagnosis of Lassa, the patient was in a standard isolation room and cared for by applying proper barrier nursing and infection prevention and control practices. She had no bleeding symptoms and was afebrile during the hospital stay. Her overall status gradually improved, beside neurological signs including hearing loss.Contact tracing among health care workers and family members was initiated [1 Apr 2016] and so far include 75 persons with low-level exposure that have been contacted [4 Apr 2016]. Low-level exposure is defined as being active in patient care or close household contacts. They perform twice a daily temperature control and report in case of symptoms. One patient that shared room during the hospital stay for a few hours is also under surveillance. The additional social and casual contacts have been considered as no risk exposure.Contact tracing and reporting is ongoing and so far no suspected secondary case have been identified.--Peter Ulleryd, MD, PhD for the investigation teamDept of communicable disease control and preventionRegion VÌ stra GÌ¦talandSweden<peter.ulleryd@vgregion.se>[This report answers some of the questions about this case raised in the previous report. The patient first became ill after her arrival in Sweden. The country where she acquired her infection, given before as West Africa, is now specifically identified as Liberia, a West African country endemic for Lassa virus. Interestingly, there was a previous Lassa fever case imported into Sweden from West Africa (country not specified) in 2011.Liberia has been the source of an imported Lassa fever case in the past. There was a businessman who acquired his infection there, returned to New Jersey, USA, and died there.The case above in Sweden illustrates 3 points: (1) that an accurate travel history is essential to narrow the field of possible diagnoses; (2) provisional diagnosis supported by appropriate laboratory tests is a critical step in arriving at the final diagnosis; and (3) prompt treatment in an isolation unit with proper personal protective equipment is essential to avoid nosocomial infections of health care workers, which has been a significant problem in hospitals in the endemic Lassa virus areas of Africa.The patient's observation of rodent excreta in the environment in Liberia is important. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, known as the multimammate rat. These rats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and feces.
