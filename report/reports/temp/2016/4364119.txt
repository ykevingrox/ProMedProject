Stuff, The Dominion Post [edited]<http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/82396485/cryptosporidiosis-outbreak-forces-pool-to-close-at-poriruas-arena-aquatic-centre>The pools at Te Rauparaha Arena and Aquatic Centre [Porirua, Wellington region] are closed due to 5 cases of [cryptosporidiosis], which causes symptoms including diarrhoea, linked to its water.Porirua City Council announced it had closed the council-run Arena Aquatic Centre on Friday afternoon [22 Jul 2016], after confirmation earlier in the day of 5 cases of the highly contagious illness cryptosporidiosis linked to the pool.The parasitic infection causes symptoms including diarrhoea. Sue Chapman, the pool's manager, said those who became sick swam in the pool between 19 and 26 Jun [2016].The whole centre would be closed for 2 days for cleaning of the arena's leisure pool, lane pool, spa and toddler pools. A higher-than-usual dose of chlorine dioxide would be used. ""Although we have not been instructed by Regional Public Health to close, we believe the health of our customers is paramount,"" Chapman said.""We apologise for the inconvenience to our regular users, but expect they would rather we took this precautionary approach."" Chapman said and surfaces and pool equipment would also be cleaned. ""Anything the water has touched will be washed.""The pool is scheduled to reopen at 5am on Monday [25 Jul 2016].The council's statement said it was important people did not swim for at least a fortnight [2 weeks] after any illness involving diarrhoea and tummy upset, to avoid passing bugs to other swimmers. People were also reminded to shower before entering the pool and to ensure babies and toddlers wore a swim suit and, if required, a swim nappy that was tight-fitting around the legs.Wellington City Council's recreation facilities manager Julian Todd also asked people to stay away from the capital city's pools if they have been sick with diarrhoea or stomach upsets in the past couple of weeks.Staff at Wellington's council pools will work closely with Regional Public Health and with Porirua City Council to keep an eye on the new cryptosporidiosis outbreak, Todd said.""But our main advice is please don't come to our pools if you've been sick in the past fortnight. If you do you'll just put the health of other people at risk and also possibly cause our pools to be closed.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Infection with the intestinal protozoan _Cryptosporidium_ causes cryptosporidiosis, an acute gastrointestinal infection with diarrhoea and vomiting. In healthy individuals the infection is usually self-limiting. However, in immunosuppressed patients the course may be severe and require hospital admission. Transmission in swimming pools is well known (see previous ProMED-mail reports below). Cryptosporidium is not very sensitive to chlorination and if children -- as pointed out here -- do not wear ""swim nappies,"" they should not enter the pool. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24203>.]
