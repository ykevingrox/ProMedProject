Prague Daily Monitor, Czech News Agency (CTK) report [edited]<http://praguemonitor.com/2016/02/02/czechrep-still-leads-eu-number-tick-borne-encephalitis>The Czech Republic continues to lead the EU [European Union] in the number of tick-borne encephalitis cases, in spite of its slight decline in 2015, Rostislav Madar, a member of the European working group for tick-borne encephalitis, told CTK on [Mon 1 Feb 2016].A total of 351 cases were registered in the 10.5-million [population] Czech Republic last year [2015], the highest numbers in the regions of South Bohemia and Vysocina (southeast Bohemia and southwest Moravia); 2 patients died.A higher occurrence of the disease was also registered in Central Bohemia, South Moravia, and the Plzen (west Bohemia) and Pardubice (east Bohemia) regions.As a result of droughts in 2015, the total number of cases declined from 410 in 2014.While 3 Czech patients got infected from unprocessed goat milk [locally], 4 Czechs got infected abroad -- in Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, respectively, and citizens of the USA, Lithuania, and Slovakia got infected in the Czech Republic.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus and cases occur yearly there. Although the report above indicates that the Czech Republic has the most TBE cases in the European Union, it is odd the few cases that come to the attention of ProMED-mail, compared to reports from other EU countries.As indicated in ProMED-mail archive no. 20061112.3248, Dr Martin Haditsch MD, PhD, commented to an earlier report concerning the incidence of TBE in the Czech Republic, ""One very important reason for the increase of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) infections is the change of leisure time activities: ticks are attracted by butyric acid, for example, in human sweat. Ticks are not limited to woodland areas; lying on the ground, going through high grass, even sitting in the garden or in parks in endemic areas may be a substantial risk. The manifestation rate of clinical disease will not exceed 1:100, the severity of TBE (as in some other diseases) is age-dependent, and the presentation, especially in children, may not be as the classical ""meningoencephalitis."" We must, therefore, consider underreporting and erroneous estimations of transmission rates [as indicators of disease occurrence]."" - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/110>.]
