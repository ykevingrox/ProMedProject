WHDH.com, 7News report [edited]<http://www.whdh.com/story/31808017/bps-two-schools-test-positive-for-elevated-lead-levels-in-drinking-water>Water fountains have been shut down in 4 schools after a test revealed high levels of lead, according to Boston Public Schools [BPS]. BPS said Mayor Marty Walsh and Superintendent Tommy Chang have requested that all water fountains in Boston's public schools be tested for lead.A total of 38 schools have been assessed, and the results for 26 schools were made available Sunday. 4 of those schools- the Thomas J. Kenny Elementary School in Dorchester, the Rafael Hernandez K-8 School in Roxbury, Boston Latin Academy in Dorchester, and the Richard J. Murphy K-8 School in Dorchester, were all determined to have water fountains that exceeded the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's action level of 15 parts per billion.Boston Public Schools has deactivated all 4 water fountains at the Kenny School, 1 water fountain at the Hernandez school, 3 fountains at Boston Latin Academy, and 1 fountain at the Murphy school. Students were also provided with more access to bottled water. According to BPS, parents of students at the schools were notified about the elevated lead levels.In response to the incident, BPS released the following statement:""BPS considers the health and well-being of its students and faculty a top priority. BPS Health Services is available to speak with any parents who have concerns, or who may want their children tested out of an abundance of caution. The district is committed to ensuring that students have access to clean, potable water in all of our schools. In the past, when the issue of lead in the public drinking water supply became a national health concern, BPS switched to bottled water across all schools. Recently, the district launched a plan to begin restoring water fountains in schools across the district, and is taking all necessary steps to make sure that any new water fountains made available to the public meet acceptable state and federal standards.""Parents who wish to have their kids tested for elevated levels are advised to collect [or conduct?] 3 to 4 consecutive tests.[Byline: John Cuoco]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[One has to wonder why only 4 schools were above the approved level for lead in the water. Is it older schools with lead pipes? Is it a different source of water? It would appear these are smaller schools based on the number of drinking fountains turned off. Alternatively, is it the type of fountain? Or is there contamination in the unit itself? - Mod.TG]****** [2] Washington (Tacoma)Date: Mon 25 Apr 2016Source: Komo News [edited]<http://komonews.com/news/local/2-tacoma-elementary-school-test-positive-for-high-lead-levels>Two elementary schools in Tacoma have tested positive for high lead levels in their drinking water -- in 1 case over 150 times the acceptable limit, the Tacoma School District announced Monday.The water had actually been tested last May [2015] as part of a voluntary testing process, with the results coming back in June, according to Dan Voepel with Tacoma schools. However, the district didn't review the results until Friday, and discovered ""abnormally high"" lead levels at Reed Elementary School and Mann Elementary School, Voepel said. ""They were discovered in a review of the records that occurred last [Fri 22 Apr 2016] evening and we're trying to investigate why those were not checked before,"" Voepel said.Later [Mon 25 Apr], Voepel announced an employee was put on paid administrative leave pending investigation of testing and reporting protocols. At Reed Elementary, testing was done at 59 locations and 39 of those locations showed lead levels above 20 parts per billion. The levels ranged from 5 ppb to 2330 ppb, Voepel said. Anything over 15 ppb is when warnings are triggered. At Mann Elementary, testing was done at 69 locations and 23 of those locations showed lead levels above 20 ppb. The levels ranged from 0 to 784 ppb.School officials have blocked off the drinking water at those 2 schools and are bringing in bottled water. They can't wash with tap water nor clean anything in the kitchen -- it all has to be bottled. They're also retesting the water there and are going to retest the water at all their elementary schools, Voepel said.Leslie Cooley, the treasurer for the Parent Teacher Association at Reed, said in a phone interview with the Associated Press Monday the association will be asking further questions of the district soon and added the test results worried her. ""It bothers me that they knew about it for a year and didn't do anything,"" she said.The news comes as Tacoma water-utility managers have been scrambling to determine the extent of high lead levels in parts of the city after lead was detected in drinking water to 4 homes located in Tacoma's Lincoln neighborhood near Yakima Avenue and South 38th Street. Each of those properties tested significantly higher than the EPA's action level of 15 parts per billion. In 1 case, a residential property's lead level tested as high as 400 parts per billion.Municipal officials attribute the presence of lead to sections of pipes known as ""goosenecks."" On the city website, the pieces of lead pipe are described as having been used between 1900 and 1940 to connect the water main to customers' service lines. However, the schools don't have that connection. Investigators are still looking into what could be the source of the high lead levels in the schools.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Old lead water pipes are a problem. The source of the water in some cases may be a problem. Even drinking fountains with lead parts may be part of the problem.While ""safe"" levels are set by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the notification of problems seems a bit tardy. For example, the Act states that public education is by poster or pamphlet within 60 days of exceeded limits. 60 days is a long time to drink contaminated water. In the case of these schools a year is definitely problematic.CDC determined that lead concentrations in drinking water should be below the EPA action level of 15 parts per billion because no safe blood level has been identified for young children, all sources of lead exposure for children should be controlled or eliminated <http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/water.htm>.There are many possible symptoms of lead poisoning and lead can affect many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can cause severe emergency symptoms.However, it is more common for lead poisoning to build up slowly over time. This occurs from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead. In this case, there may not be any obvious symptoms. Over time, even low levels of lead exposure can harm a child's mental development. The health problems get worse as the level of lead in the blood gets higher.Lead is much more harmful to children than adults because it can affect their developing nerves and brains. The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most vulnerable.Possible complications include:- Behavior or attention problems- Failure at school- Hearing problems- Kidney damage- Reduced IQ [intelligence quotient]- Slowed body growthThe symptoms of lead poisoning may include:- Abdominal pain and cramping (usually the 1st sign of a high, toxic dose of lead poison)- Aggressive behavior- Anemia- Constipation- Difficulty getting pregnant- Difficulty sleeping- Headaches- Hearing loss- Irritability- Loss of previous developmental skills (in young children)- Low appetite and energy- Reduced sensationsVery high levels of lead may cause vomiting, staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.Exposure to even low levels of lead can cause damage over time, especially in children. The greatest risk is to brain development, where irreversible damage may occur. Higher levels can damage the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults. Very high lead levels may cause seizures, unconsciousness, and possibly death.People with higher lead levels have a greater risk of long-lasting health problems. They must be followed carefully. Their nerves and muscles can be greatly affected and may no longer function as well as they should. Other body systems may be harmed to various degrees, such as the kidneys and blood vessels. People who survive toxic lead levels may have some permanent brain damage. Children are more vulnerable to serious long-term problems.A complete recovery from chronic lead poisoning may take months to years.<https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002473.htm>.Alternative names for lead poisoning are plumbism, colica pictorum, saturnism, Devon colic, or painter's colic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning>.Doctors usually use a simple blood test to detect lead poisoning. A small blood sample is taken from a finger prick or from a vein. Lead levels in the blood are measured in micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL). A level of 5 mcg/dL or higher indicates your child may have unsafe levels of lead in their blood and should have their blood tested periodically. If levels become too high -- generally 45 mcg/dL or higher -- your child should be treated.The 1st step in treating all degrees of lead poisoning is to remove the source of the contamination. If you can't remove lead from your environment, you may at least be able to reduce the likelihood that it will cause problems. For instance, sometimes it's better to seal in rather than remove old lead paint. Your local health department can recommend ways to identify and reduce lead in your home and community.For children and adults with relatively low lead levels, simply avoiding exposure to lead may be enough to reduce blood lead levels.For more severe cases, your doctor may recommend:- chelation therapy. In this treatment, you take a medication that binds with the lead so that it's excreted in your urine.- EDTA therapy. Doctors treat adults with lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL of blood with one or more of 3 drugs, most commonly a chemical called ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, or edetic acid). Depending on your lead level, you may need more than one treatment. In such severe cases, however, it may not be possible to reverse damage that has already occurred.Children may need chelation therapy at lower levels than adults do.References----------1.
