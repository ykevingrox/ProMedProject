Publika.MD[edited]<http://en.publika.md/romania-registers-40-cases-of-west-nile-virus-infection-in-four-months_2627624.html>Some 40 cases of West Nile virus infection were registered in Romania from [1 May to 31 Aug 2016], the figure being higher than the total number of infections recorded in 2015, Romania-Insider informs.Of the people infected with the West Nile virus in this period 4 died, according to a briefing of the National Center for Transmissible Diseases Surveillance and Control published on the website of the National Public Health Institute, reports local Agerpres. One of the fatal cases was registered in early August [2016].People aged 70-79 were the ones more affected by this virus (14 cases of infection registered between [1 May and 31 Aug 2016]), followed by those aged between 50 and 59, 60 and 69, and over 80.Cases of West Nile virus infection were registered in Bucharest, but also in Mures, Iasi, Neamt, Galati, Dolj, Prahova, Dambovita, Giurgiu, Ilfov, Ialomita, Braila, and Tulcea counties.The virus is most commonly transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Doctors recommend people to reduce the risk of getting infected by using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing to prevent mosquito bites.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Seroprevalence data suggest that West Nile virus (WNV) activity in southern Romania dates to the 1960s or earlier (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11797808>). The largest outbreak of WNV infection in Europe to date was in Romania when in 1996 over 800 clinical cases of neuroinvasive disease were reported, 393 of which were confirmed for WNV. A total of 17 deaths were reported in this outbreak. The majority of cases were resident (and probably infected) in the capital, Bucharest. Following this outbreak, Romania implemented a surveillance system for WNV infections (Tsai TF, Popovici F, Cernescu C, Campbell GL, Nedelcu NI: West Nile encephalitis epidemic in southeastern Romania. Lancet. 1998; 352(9130): 767-71>; abstract available at <http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(98)03538-7/abstract>).WNV infection in Romania is endemic in bird, horse, and human populations. This is evidenced by high seroprevalence rates in horses and sporadic reports of human cases on an annual basis. Viral circulation was intense during a large outbreak in 1996 in Bucharest and it appeared intense and more widespread during another 2010 outbreak. The precise reasons for the intense and widespread WNV circulation in the Mediterranean during recent years are unclear and probably multifactorial. It is likely that there is some contribution of local climatic conditions to be more favourable for viral transmission from bird populations to humans. However, it is also possible that viral characteristics have played a role. For this reason, it would be important to genetically characterise the virus and try to understand what (if any) influence its genetic makeup may have had on improving vector competence and capacity. - Mod.UBAMaps of Romania can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
