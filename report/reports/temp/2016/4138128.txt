A medical team from Kashipur Community Health Centre (CHC) visited the village on [Sun 3 Apr 2016]. The health officials administered medicines to more than 60 affected villagers and family members of the deceased.Meanwhile, 3 villagers were admitted to District Headquarters Hospital (DHH). Shanti Bhusan Pathi, in-charge of Kashipur CHC, said the villagers had consumed beef 15 days back. Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO), Anand Padhi, said blood samples of the affected persons have been sent for laboratory test. The disease has not spread to neighboring villages yet, and the condition of the affected persons is stable.Anthrax is a serious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle, typically affecting the skin and lungs. It can be transmitted to humans, causing severe skin ulceration or a form of pneumonia.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52680>. Rayagada is on the southernmost border of Odisha with Andhra Pradesh, see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayagada>.Anthrax is a constant problem in both states with outbreaks in most years. While Indians are forbidden from butchering cattle, animals that have died will be butchered and consumed, and human cases, as in this incident, will then follow when the animal had died of anthrax. The most cost effective way of preventing such human cases and hospitalizations is to routinely vaccinate the cattle. When this is not done, the disease declares itself not just by unreported livestock deaths but by unnecessarily killing villagers. - Mod.MHJ]
