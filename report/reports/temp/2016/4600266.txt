BT News [edited]<http://home.bt.com/news/uk-news/swimming-pool-closed-after-dozens-of-children-fall-ill-11364109402392>A pool has been temporarily shut amid reports that dozens of children fell ill after going swimming there. Splashes pool in Rainham, Kent, has been inundated with reports of children suffering sickness and diarrhoea after visiting on Friday [28 Oct 2016].A parent posted on its Facebook page: ""My little boy went here on Friday along with his friend and they both became ill. Thought they might [have] just given each other a bug but after talking to more than 20 friends and friends of friends who also went [there] on the same day, they had all been sick.""Another wrote: ""My 2 children went to Splashes on Friday, 28 Oct 2016, and both had chronic sickness and diarrhea last night. They haven't been this ill in years and they're still feeling extremely ill now.""Another mother said: ""My little boy is poorly too, so is my nephew. Something definitely needs to be done. So many cases have been reported on Facebook.""The pool, run by Medway Council, was closed on Monday [1 Nov 2016] ""as a precaution"" as deep cleaning took place in the changing rooms and pool. A Medway Council spokesman said: ""Following reports of sickness among some children who had visited Splashes on Friday [28 Oct 2016], we are thoroughly cleaning the pool and changing areas and have increased chlorine levels in the pool.""While we cannot determine whether the illness is linked to Splashes, we have taken necessary precautions to stop the potential further spread of germs. We urge customers not to visit the pool when they are feeling unwell, especially when suffering with sickness, as this would be the most likely cause of any spread of illness to other customers."" The council said it had so far received 11 complaints.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[While a variety of enteric pathogens can be associated with recreational water, cryptosporidiosis is likely at the top of the list, especially when the recreational water is a swimming pool. The following is a CDC report published in 2011 regarding the subject:Hlavsa MC, Roberts VA, Anderson AR, et al: Surveillance for waterborne disease outbreaks and other health events associated with recreational water --- United States, 2007--2008. MMWR Surveill Summ. 2011 Sep 23;60(12):1-32Since 1978, CDC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have collaborated on the Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) for collecting and reporting data on waterborne disease outbreaks associated with recreational water. This surveillance system is the primary source of data concerning the scope and health effects of waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States. In addition, data are collected on other select recreational water--associated health events, including pool chemical--associated health events and single cases of Vibrio wound infection and primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).Data presented summarize recreational water--associated outbreaks and other health events that occurred during January 2007--December 2008. Previously unreported data on outbreaks that have occurred since 1978 also are presented. The WBDOSS database includes data on outbreaks associated with recreational water, drinking water, water not intended for drinking (excluding recreational water), and water use of unknown intent. Public health agencies in the states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Freely Associated States are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating waterborne disease outbreaks and voluntarily reporting them to CDC using a standard form. Only data on outbreaks associated with recreational water are summarized in this report. Data on other recreational water--associated health events reported to CDC, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) also are summarized.RESULTS-------------A total of 134 recreational water--associated outbreaks were reported by 38 states and Puerto Rico for 2007--2008. These outbreaks resulted in at least 13 966 cases. The median outbreak size was 11 cases (range: 2--5,697 cases). A total of 116 (86.6%) outbreaks were associated with treated recreational water (e.g., pools and interactive fountains) and resulted in 13 480 (96.5%) cases. Of the 134 outbreaks, 81 (60.4%) were outbreaks of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI); 24 (17.9%) were outbreaks of dermatologic illnesses, conditions, or symptoms; and 17 (12.7%) were outbreaks of acute respiratory illness. Outbreaks of AGI resulted in 12 477 (89.3%) cases. The etiology was laboratory-confirmed for 105 (78.4%) of the 134 outbreaks. Of the 105 outbreaks with a laboratory-confirmed etiology, 68 (64.8%) were caused by parasites, 22 (21.0%) by bacteria, five (4.8%) by viruses, nine (8.6%) by chemicals or toxins, and one (1.0%) by multiple etiology types. Cryptosporidium was confirmed as the etiologic agent of 60 (44.8%) of 134 outbreaks, resulting in 12 154 (87.0%) cases; 58 (96.7%) of these outbreaks, resulting in a total of 12 137 (99.9%) cases, were associated with treated recreational water. A total of 32 pool chemical--associated health events that occurred in a public or residential setting were reported to WBDOSS by Maryland and Michigan. These events resulted in 48 cases of illness or injury; 26 (81.3%) events could be attributed at least partially to chemical handling errors (e.g., mixing incompatible chemicals). ATSDR's Hazardous Substance Emergency Events Surveillance System received 92 reports of hazardous substance events that occurred at aquatic facilities. More than half of these events (55 [59.8%]) involved injured persons; the most frequently reported primary contributing factor was human error. Estimates based on CPSC's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data indicate that 4574 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2703--6446) emergency department (ED) visits attributable to pool chemical--associated injuries occurred in 2008; the most frequent diagnosis was poisoning (1784 ED visits [95% CI: 585--2984]). NEISS data indicate that pool chemical--associated health events occur frequently in residential settings. A total of 236 Vibrio wound infections were reported to be associated with recreational water exposure; 36 (48.6%) of the 74 hospitalized vibriosis patients and six (66.7%) of the nine vibriosis patients who died had V. vulnificus infections. Eight fatal cases of PAM occurred after exposure to warm untreated freshwater.INTERPRETATION-------------------------The 134 recreational water--associated outbreaks reported for 2007--2008 represent a substantial increase over the 78 outbreaks reported for 2005--2006 and the largest number of outbreaks ever reported to WBDOSS for a 2-year period. Outbreaks, especially the largest ones, were most frequently associated with treated recreational water and characterized by AGI. Cryptosporidium remains the leading etiologic agent. Pool chemical--associated health events occur frequently but are preventable. Data on other select recreational water--associated health events further elucidate the epidemiology of U.S. waterborne disease by highlighting less frequently implicated types of recreational water (e.g., oceans) and detected types of recreational water--associated illness (i.e., not AGI).PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS--------------------------------------CDC uses waterborne disease outbreak surveillance data to 1) identify the types of etiologic agents, recreational water venues, and settings associated with waterborne disease outbreaks; 2) evaluate the adequacy of regulations and public awareness activities to promote healthy and safe swimming; and 3) establish public health priorities to improve prevention efforts, guidelines, and regulations at the local, state, and federal levels. - Mod.
