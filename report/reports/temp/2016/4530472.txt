CPH Post [edited]<http://cphpost.dk/news/tech/dangerous-mosquito-species-found-south-of-copenhagen.html>Mosquitoes of the species _Culex modestus_, which are known for spreading the dangerous West Nile virus, have been found at 4 ponds in the nature reserve of Vestamager, south of Copenhagen.According to Rene Bodker from the National Veterinary Institute, this is the 2nd time the species has been registered in Denmark.In 2014, epidemiologists found the mosquitoes at a waterhole near a residential neighbourhood in the southwestern Copenhagen suburb of Greve.Bodker contends the species is migrating to Denmark due to the warmer climate and could also be breeding in other parts of Zealand and Skaane.Although West Nile virus (WNV) infection can cause serious health problems, such as fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea and, in some cases, even encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), Bodker says the occurrence of _Culex modestus_ in Denmark is no cause for concern.Bodker explained that the flying insects would 1st have to bite an infected bird and then immediately transmit the virus to a person. ""When there are no dangerous viruses around, there is no danger,"" Bodker noted. Moreover, the mosquito season is slowly coming to end in Denmark.In Europe, WNV infection presents a great public health issue in Greece and Italy, although some cases have been reported also in Austria.Currently, there is no vaccine for WNV [for human use. There is a vaccine for equine animals. - Mod.TY], and the best prevention is to use mosquito repellents and avoid standing near pools of water where the insects are likely to breed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Interestingly, _Culex modestus_ was found in Denmark in 2014. _Culex modestus_ is one of the main WNV vectors in Europe and has been shown to be a more efficient vector than _Cx. pipiens_ in the laboratory. It feeds on birds, horses and humans. The risk of permanent populations becoming established in Denmark is not known and will likely depend on their ability to survive the winter.WNV is endemic in the Mediterranean Basin and into southern Central Europe and into Russia. Concern about expansion of the WNV range into northern Europe and the UK, where this mosquito has been found also, is justified and warrants continued surveillance of both vectors and the virus. This mosquito can transmit the Usutu virus from birds to humans as well.Although there is no risk this year (2016) of West Nile virus transmission in Denmark due to the presence of _Culex modestus_, finding this potential vector mosquito is another illustration of movement of vectors into new geographical areas. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/111>.]
