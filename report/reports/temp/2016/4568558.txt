The bat was found by a private person. The bat had neurological signs and then died.Laboratory analyses conducted during the 13 and 14 Oct 2016, confirmed the presence of rabies by FAT. The virus was then identified as European Bat Lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) by RT-PCR and partial sequencing of the gene for the nucleoprotein. Also cell culture is positive.The bat originated from Inkoo in the province of Southern Finland and is part of the Uusimaa region. This is the 2nd case of EBLV-2 in a bat in Finland.--Tiina NokirekiHead of Section, DVM, Specialist in Veterinary Medicine, Infectious DiseasesFinnish Food Safety Authority EviraResearch Department, Veterinary VirologyMustialankatu 3,FI-00790 Helsinki,Finland<tiina.nokireki@evira.fi>[Special thanks to Dr. Nokireki for this important contribution. Infections by European Bat Lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) have been previously reported in Northern Europe, not only in bats, but also in humans. EBLV-1 appears to be more prevalent, accounting for the vast majority of all EBLV-infected bats. Reports of EBLV-2 correspond to Daubenton's bats (_Myotis daubentonii_), indicating that this bat species is the reservoir of this _Lyssavirus_ strain.For a picture of a Daubenton's bat go to <http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g62/TigerQuoll/European%20Wildlife/battraffic01.adapt.1190.2_zpsojuulgel.jpg>.- Mod.PMBA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38705>.][See Also:2015----Rabies (EBLV-2), bat - Norway (02): mainland, Daubenton's bat, conf. 20151112.3787427Rabies (EBLV-2), bat - Norway: mainland, susp.
