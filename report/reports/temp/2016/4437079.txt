Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Lepto-claims-auto-driver-dengue-fever-cases-rise/articleshow/53817493.cms>A Kandivli auto driver succumbed to leptospirosis on Friday [19 Aug 2016]. Leptospirosis saw a spike with almost 300 people admitted to various BMC hospitals in the same period [between August 1 and 21]. ""Only 45 of these had confirmed leptospirosis,"" said a senior BMC health official. The official said the 55-year-old autorickshaw driver who died was first admitted to a local hospital in Kandivli on August 16, but was shifted to Kasturba Hospital, Chinchpokli, two days later. The patient was found to have diabetes and developed sepsis before passing away on August 19 [2016].Meanwhile, the city continued to reel under water-borne diseases such as jaundice and gastroenteritis. One case of cholera, too, was also detected, along with 77 cases of hepatitis and 684 cases of gastroenteritis.The BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] has been carrying out disease control measures for leptospirosis and dengue. In a drive conducted between August 16 and 20, BMC staff surveyed nearly 5,000 localities that included 2.6 lakh homes and found breeding spots for dengue mosquitoes in 718 homes. Of the 3000 people screened for leptospirosis, 4 had fever and were given preventive medicines.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Kandivali is a suburb in the northern part of Mumbai (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandivali>). Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55086>. Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of about 20.5 million (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai>). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra.Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide, and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall. Mumbai is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (June-September). July is the wettest month, with almost non-stop rain. At this time, parts of the city become waterlogged (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mumbai>) or flooded under several feet of water, as has been reported today (6 Jul 2015) in Mumbai (<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/Rain-lashes-city-water-logging-hits-city-traffic/articleshow/47964435.cms>).Leptospira are transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal.Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. After exposure to floodwater contaminated by leptospira-infected animal urine (usually rat -- see ProMED-mail: Leptospirosis - India: (MH) 20160706.4328586 and in India, cattle -- see ProMED-mail: Leptospirosis - India (02): (MH) bovine 20160727.4374009), the bacteria can enter the human body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. - Mod.ML]
