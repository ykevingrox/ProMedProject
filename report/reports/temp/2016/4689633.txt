As of today, 10 Dec 2016, there have been a total of 1506 newly confirmed cases including 624 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia since September 2012. There are currently 16 active cases. The case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia continues to hover in the 41 percent range.Since the beginning of December 2016, there have been a total of 15 newly confirmed cases, 6 fatalities and 4 recoveries reported by Saudi Arabia, compared with 20 cases reported in the whole month of November 2016, suggestive of an increase in transmission ongoing. Cases this month (December 2016) have been reported from: Afeef (1), Hufoof (2), Jeddah (1), Khaibar (1), Madinah (2), Mahail Aseer (2), Mahd-Aldhahab (1), Riyadh (4), and Sakaka (1). All 15 cases were classified as primary cases with 5 having a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness and the remaining 10 stated to have high risk exposure histories still under investigation.Other countries in the region have reported primary cases associated with contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, but at significantly lower rates. One can't help but wonder what is different in Saudi Arabia that there are so many primary cases? Are there different animal husbandry practices? Is the index of suspicion much higher in Saudi Arabia so that many more mild cases are being detected?Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the cases can be found at the source URLs.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Oman - WHO 8 Dec 2016Date: Wed 8 Dec 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/8-december-2016-mers-oman/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Oman--------------------------------------------------------------On [29 Nov 2016], the National IHR Focal Point of Oman reported one (1) additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).Details of the caseA 67-year-old male from Dakhlia Governorate developed symptoms on [18 Nov 2016], and was admitted to hospital on [20 Nov 2016].
