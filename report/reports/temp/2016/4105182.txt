Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/botswana-blood-bank-ships-syphilis-tainted-blood-units-transfused-51189/>In a horrible mix-up in Botswana, local media reports 3 units of blood that were sent to Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone city were positive for syphilis and later transfused to unknown/undisclosed patients.The tainted blood was sent by The National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) within the past couple weeks and the error was just recognized.Based on the report, the blood bank says they recently acquired new equipment that missed and passed the infected blood. NBTS director, Mukendi Kayembe said, acknowledging the incident, The Ministry is aware of the issue and they should be in a proper position to answer you."" A spokesman for the hospital said they received no communication from the blood bank.Transfusion-transmitted syphilis, which is caused by _Treponema pallidum_, is one of the oldest recognized infectious risks of blood transfusion. Routine screening of blood donors and refrigeration of donated blood before its use has made transfusion-transmitted syphilis very rare.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Syphilis can be transmitted via blood and blood products, when donors are in the primary or secondary stage of the disease as a consequence of spirochetemia during these phases of the disease (<http://www.tmreviews.com/article/S0887-7963(96)80005-8/abstract>). However, transfusion-transmitted syphilis has become very rare (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/185/4/545.long>), as a consequence of screening of donors for high-risk sexual behavior or a history of sexually transmitted diseases, serologic testing for syphilis (using non-treponemal test, such as VDRL [venereal disease research laboratory] or RPR [rapid plasma reagin], and treponemal tests), and storage of blood and blood products at refrigerator temperatures._Treponema pallidum_ lose viability after 5 days under refrigerated blood bank storage conditions. (We are not told in the news report above, if the contaminated blood used in Gaborone has been previously stored at refrigerator temperatures.) However, platelet concentrates are routinely stored at room temperature, and blood banks in low-income, developing countries with a limited blood supply and high demand may collect from family donors and transfuse it soon thereafter. Also serologic tests for syphilis can be negative in early syphilis; for example, nontreponemal tests take approximately 4 to 6 weeks after infection and 1 to 3 weeks after the appearance of the primary lesion to become positive. Thus, syphilis can be transmitted by blood from donors who are clinically and serologically negative. The prevalence of syphilis in a particular region can also affect the risk of transfusion-transmitted syphilis. Since many recipients of blood and blood products are receiving antibiotics coincidentally, these drugs could mask the clinical picture of transfusion-transmitted syphilis and the its diagnosis of not appreciated. Moreover, transfusion cases have no chancre, which is the diagnostic hallmark of syphilis.Botswana, with a population of just over 2 million people, is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana>). It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast, Namibia to the west and north, and Zimbabwe to the northeast. About 70 percent of its territory is the Kalahari Desert. About 10 percent of its population lives in the capital and largest city, Gaborone. Botswana has one of the highest GDP per capita in Africa, but about a quarter of its population is estimated to be HIV-infected. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5935>.]
