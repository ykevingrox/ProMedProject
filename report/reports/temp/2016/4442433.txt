Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/anaplasmosis-seen-in-increased-numbers-in-maine-this-year-41228/>The number of cases of the tick-borne bacterial infection, anaplasmosis, are up significantly in the state of Maine, according to data from the state's Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Through 18 Aug [2016], the Maine CDC has reported 228 anaplasmosis cases. This compares to 186 cases in all of 2015. More than half the cases have been reported from the Mid-Coast region, mostly in Knox and Lincoln counties.The Maine CDC is also reporting 49 cases of the tick-borne parasitic infection, babesiosis, through mid-August [2016]. This compares to 55 cases reported all of last year [2015].In addition, health officials have reported 11 co-infections -- 4 co-infections with anaplasmosis and Lyme disease, 2 co-infections with babesiosis and Lyme disease and 5 co-infections with anaplasmosis and babesiosis.The Maine CDC says current data for Lyme disease is not available; however, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a cumulative total through 20 Aug [2016] of 479 Lyme disease cases in Maine.The organism that causes this disease is called _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_. It is an intracellular pathogen that is part of the _Rickettsia_ (the same group of bacteria that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever amongst other diseases) family. Formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and as the former name of the disease implies, it's an infection of the white blood cells [specifically granulocytes].People get this infection through the bite of an infected tick. Depending on the part of the United States you are, the tick species is different: the eastern part of the country is the black-legged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_, and in the western part of the country, _Ixodes pacificus_ is usually involved. These are deer ticks that are also involved in the transmission of Lyme disease [and babesiosis].After a period of a couple of days to a few weeks, most people infected with _Anaplasma_ show influenza-like symptoms (fever, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and respiratory symptoms such as a cough). Symptoms tend to be more severe in those [who] are immunosuppressed and the elderly.The case fatality rate (i.e., the proportion of anaplasmosis patients that reportedly died as a result of infection) has remained low, at less than 1 percent.Because _A. phagocytophilum_ infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream, this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. _A. phagocytophilum_ has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood.Doxycycline is the 1st line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Discussions of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), babesiosis, and Lyme disease can be found in my comments in ProMED-mail posts below.
