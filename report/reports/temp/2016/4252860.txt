Tuberculosis - Spain: (CL) school, RFI 20160516.4225012-------------------------------------------------------Local health authorities [who were] informally contacted confirm this information reported by media as real and that it has been shared with media as official data.For any further detail it is necessary to formally contact the head of local health authorities at the General Directorate of Castile and Leon, in Valladolid; however, please consider that local media, quoting the local health authorities already reported several interesting details; see:Date: Thu 19 May 2016Source: Soy de Arroyo [in Spanish, trans., summ., edited]<http://soydearroyo.elnortedecastilla.es/actualidad/2016-05-19/totalidad-ninos-analizados-colegio-raimundo-1117.html>All 48 children [in the 1st year of primary education] identified as at risk at the school [have been] tested [and were] negative [for clinically active tuberculosis]. The same article also reports some details on response activities, including the activation of the response protocol already on [5 May 2016], the day of detection (the case detected was quite severe and admitted at ICU but has now been discharged).Parents of the confirmed case [were] also negative. Further investigations identified a tutor (teacher) as the source of infection (asymptomatic) [but the teacher's smear [presumably] of sputum was positive for tubercle bacilli]. A 3rd case was identified within the family of the teacher (a child). The outbreak is considered as over now.Of the 48 students tested, 20 had positive [tuberculin] skin [test] reactions within 48 hours, which means they are not infected [see below]: they were referred to a local hospital for chest x rays, which were negative. Following the protocol, prophylactic treatment based on isoniazid was started and will be carried for 6 months [in these 20 children].[Active tuberculosis] was definitely ruled out in the 28 children [who were] negative to the 1st [tuberculin skin] test; as by protocol, these 28 children will have to repeat the [tuberculin skin] test within 2 months.All teachers were also tested as a precaution, [and the] results are still pending.[byline: Jota de la Fuente]--communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberJas Mantero[ProMED-mail thanks Jas Mantero for the submission above.Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. TB exists in 2 forms: latent TB infection with only a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and clinically active TB infection (TB disease). TB in children, either as latent TB infection or as TB disease, is an indication of recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_, usually from an adult with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis, who was in close contact with the children, for example, at school, or in the home.In the outbreak in Spain, a teacher was found to be the source of the outbreak; a smear (presumably of his sputum) was positive for _M. tuberculosis_, which indicates that the teacher was likely expectorating large numbers of the organism into the environment. One of the 2 children with active tuberculosis was the teacher's pupil and the other was the teacher's child. TB in young children can become rapidly life-threatening (such as, disseminated TB or TB meningitis), as reportedly occurred in one of the 2 sick children.Medical evaluations for TB include a TST (or blood test), a chest x-ray and physical examination. TST is preferred over TB blood tests for children less than 5 years of age (<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/ltbi/treatment.htm>). Children with only a positive TST indicating latent TB infection, have _M. tuberculosis_ in their bodies, but the infection is not clinically active, that is, they do not feel sick, do not have symptoms, and have a negative physical exam and a normal chest X ray. They cannot spread the infection to others; however, they are given medication, such as isoniazid, to prevent them from ever developing clinically active TB disease, as was done in 20 of the children in the Spanish outbreak. For children in the US, the recommended length of treatment with isoniazid for latent TB infection is 9 months (<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/ltbi/treatment.htm>).The reaction to the TST is a delayed-type (cellular) hypersensitivity reaction that is read at 48-72 hours after intradermal injection and is first detectable 2-12 weeks after infection, which is the reason that 28 of the children who had an initial negative TST in the Spanish outbreak are schedule for a repeat TST in 2 months, after exposure to TB has ended. However, if the chest radiograph is normal, isoniazid treatment for latent TB infection should be initiated in children 5 years of age and younger, who have close contact with contagious TB, even if the initial TST is negative, because these young children are at high risk for progression to TB disease; and isoniazid is continued in these young children until the results of the 2nd TST and other medical evaluation are known (<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/ltbi/treatment.htm>). - Mod.MLMaps of Spain can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/europe/political-map-of-Spain.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2689>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
