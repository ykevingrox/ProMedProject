New Vision [edited]<http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1423101/govt-rollout-mass-yellow-fever-vaccination>According to state minister for health in charge of general duties Dr. Chris Baryomunsi, a yellow fever outbreak has been confirmed in some areas of Masaka and Kebisoni in Rukungiri district.In light of Kenya's decision to bar Ugandans without proof of yellow fever vaccination from entering its territory, the government of Uganda is set to rollout mass yellow fever vaccination in areas where the outbreak has been confirmed.Yellow fever is an acute viral disease caused by the yellow fever virus and spread by the bite of an infected female mosquito. It infects only humans, other primates, and several species of mosquitoes.A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever exists, and some countries require vaccinations for travelers.""Government is discussing with the World Health Organization exploring ways of rolling out mass vaccination in places where yellow fever cases have been confirmed. The vaccination process will cover a 20-km [12.4 mile] radius of these areas,"" Baryomunsi told parliament yesterday [25 Apr 2016].The mooted vaccination, whose date of rolling out was not explicitly revealed by the minister, is expected to benefit people 6 months and above [in age].The revelation came as lawmakers debated the report of the foreign affairs committee on the ministry of foreign affairs budget estimates for the financial year.Lwemiyaga County MP fired the 1st salvo, saying the House should address the issue of Ugandans stranded on the Uganda/Kenya boarder for not having received yellow fever inoculation.""There is a resurgence of yellow fever in some countries in Africa, including Angola, parts of DRC, and Uganda. Because of this outbreak, many countries have raised a red flag, including Kenya. We are liaising with the Kenyan government on this matter, but we cannot push them to drop their stance because this is a dangerous disease,"" Baryomunsi said.Lawmakers took exception to the few centers in Uganda where vaccination of yellow fever can be gotten with the former Leader of Opposition, Nandala Mafabi, calling for the opening of new centers outside Entebbe and Kampala.According to Baryomunsi, inoculation against yellow fever is carried out in only 4 places, including KCCA headquarters, Novik Hospital and Entebbe Airport. Baryomunsi said the limited number of centers where yellow fever vaccination can be carried out is the result of the shortage of yellow fever vaccine throughout the world.Baryomunsi did not explicitly inform parliament on whether the vaccine for yellow fever will be free. Attempts to get clarification from the Director General of Health Service, Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, came to naught, as her known cell phone was unavailable.However, with a dose of yellow fever vaccine going for [Uganda] sh 60 000 [USD 17.9] at KCCA, according Nandala, the mooted mass vaccination will be out of reach for many people in need of the vaccine.[Byline: Moses Walubiri, Henry Sekanjako]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The situation along the Kenya-Uganda border is increasingly difficult for Ugandans gathering there, including women and children, who have been waiting at the border for vaccine to arrive. If the price cited above is correct, the conclusion that many will not be able to afford vaccination is likely to be correct. According to a reliable source, Rukingiri is included in the 7 districts targeted for vaccination in Uganda in a proposal accepted by the ICG.  The sooner the vaccine reaches those districts the better for both East Africa and the world.PATH published back in 2013 a field study that proved that a one-fifth dose is still effective in adults. and would preumably boost immunity in children already vaccinated through the WHO/UNICEF EPI program. Lowering the dose would save more parents and leave fewer orphans [Ref: <https://www.path.org/publications/files/TS_vtg_yf_rpt.pdf>.]  Doing this would stretch vaccine stocks very usefully, and bring down the cost considerably.Note that Angola has not yet managed to vaccinate everyone who needs it in its 16 affected provinces beyond Luanda.Every day of delay means more cases, more people who need to be vaccinated, and greater risk of spread to other localities not only in East Africa but globally.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the borders adjoining Uganda, Kenya, the DR Congo, Rwanda and Tanzania can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of at-risk countries because of having 1514 alerts for dengue, carried by the same _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito  in the past 3 months  is at<http://www.healthmap.org/dengue/en>. - Mod.TY/JW]
