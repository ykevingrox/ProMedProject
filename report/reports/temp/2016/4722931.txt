San Antonio Current [edited]<http://www.sacurrent.com/the-daily/archives/2016/12/23/dozens-report-food-poisoning-at-saha-holiday-party-for-the-elderly-disabled>Metro Health is investigating why dozens of people got really sick, some having to be hospitalized, after attending a San Antonio Housing Authority [SAHA] holiday party for elderly and disabled residents last week [week of 12 Dec 2016].People first started reporting sudden gastrointestinal problems following SAHA's Golden Gala event at Freeman Coliseum last [Fri 16 Dec 2016]. According to local station KSAT, most of those in attendance were elderly SAHA residents, some of whom even had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital during the event itself. The family of one person has already filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company that catered the event after she attended the gala, came down with what appeared to be food poisoning, and eventually died after being rushed to the hospital, as KSAT first reported.The annual event for SAHA's disabled and elderly residents is hosted by the nonprofit that administers SAHA's scholarship program, the Education Investment Foundation. Nearly 1000 people attended this year's [2016] gala, according to SAHA spokeswoman Rosario Neaves.Neaves told the Current that after SAHA started hearing reports of food poisoning following the event, the housing authority provided Metro Health with a list of attendees in order to investigate the problem. So far, Metro Health has interviewed 85 people who were at the gala, the majority of whom reported some type of illness following the event (51 people, or 60 percent of those surveyed so far by Metro Health, reported getting sick).Still, in a phone call with the Current [Thu 22 Dec 2016], Neaves cautioned against drawing any hard conclusions. Sure, the health issues reported people who attended the gala sound like food poisoning, but Neaves says Metro Health has yet to determine an exact cause for the spate of illnesses, so any connection between the food at the gala (provided by the unfortunately named ""Diehard Catering"") and the illnesses is ""media speculation at this point.""[Byline: Michael Barajas]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2]Date: Fri 23 Dec 2016Source: Food Poisoning Bulletin [edited]<https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2016/food-poisoning-outbreak-in-san-antonio-texas/>A vague notice about a food poisoning outbreak in San Antonio, Texas, was posted by the City of San Antonio Metropolitan Health District on 20 Dec 2016. People got sick after attending an event sponsored by the Education Investment Foundation for San Antonio Housing Authority (SAHA) residents.The statement [<http://tinyurl.com/zscbyna>] reads, in its entirety, ""The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District (Metro Health) is investigating an illness occurring in individuals that attended an event sponsored by the Education Investment Foundation for San Antonio Housing Authority (SAHA) residents. Metro Health is conducting an epidemiological public health investigation of a cluster of individuals becoming ill after attending the event. Metro Health has been working with SAHA on the preliminary investigation and will continue to investigate the situation and will take additional measures as appropriate."" There is no mention of how many people attended the event, how many were sickened, or what their symptoms were. Symptoms can give clues to the type of pathogen that caused the illnesses.News reports covering this outbreak have more information. KSAT.com reports that about 1000 people attended the 19th Annual Golden Gala at Freeman Coliseum, hosted by the Education Investment Foundation. That report also states that at least 50 people got sick quickly after eating the dinner. Most people got better within a few days, but several people were apparently hospitalized in this outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[With a short incubation period, the possible etiologies of the illness here are quite limited and most manifest primarily with vomiting.It is likely that laboratory testing may show a food item to be contaminated with high levels of _Staphylococcus aureus_. Food can become contaminated if a person with a staph infection has an uncovered lesion or sore that comes in contact with food or food processing equipment. _S. aureus_ bacteria and toxin can contaminate foods or equipment. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are fast acting, sometimes causing illness in as little as 30 minutes but usually in 4-6 hours, with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and little if any fever. The patients usually recover within a day or so.A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than 1 hour) also suggests that the etiology was heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. - Mod.LLMore information on etiology of this incident would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1171>.]
