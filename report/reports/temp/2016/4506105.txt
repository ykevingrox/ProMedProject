Becker's Hospital Review [edited]<http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/uw-medical-or-machines-test-positive-for-legionella.html>Three heater-cooler units -- equipment used to heat and cool patients during heart surgery -- tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria at the University of Washington [UW] Medical Center in Seattle, according to a statement from UW Medicine. The news comes after the bacteria infected 4 patients at the hospital, causing a type of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Two of the infected patients have died.The source of the outbreak has been linked to the hospital's water system, as bacteria was detected in an ice machine and 2 sinks in UW Medical Center's cardiac unit in its Cascade Tower. The water system in the Cascade Tower was scheduled to be treated with a high dose of chlorine on Monday evening [19 Sep 2016].[Byline: Brian Zimmerman]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion1@q-net.net.au>******[2]Date: Tue 20 Sep 2016Source: Puget Sound Business News [edited]<http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/health-care-inc/2016/09/medical-devices-at-uw-medical-center-test-positive.html>Potentially deadly bacteria have been detected in medical devices at the University of Washington Medical Center, leading the hospital to treat some of its water supply and take the devices out of service.The _Legionella_ bacteria that were discovered can cause a serious type of pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. There have been 4 recent cases of this disease at the medical center. The disease was present in 2 patients who died, but no direct link with patient infections have been confirmed. The bacteria [were] discovered after officials increased testing of the hospital environment after 2 initial cases of the disease were reported.In total, 3 medical devices that are used to heat and cool patients during heart surgery as well as an ice machine and a sink in the Cascade Tower of the medical center have tested positive for the _Legionella_ bacteria.All infected items have been removed from service, and the medical devices' manufacturer will come to UW Medical Center to disassemble and internally clean the 3 units as well as 9 others that did not test positive for the bacteria._Legionella_ is a type of bacteria that lives naturally in fresh water; however, the bacteria can also grow in other water settings, such as showers and faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains and hot tubs. People can develop _Legionella_ pneumonia by breathing in small droplets of water, such as mist or vapor, that contain the bacteria, but it can be treated with antibiotics.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with a chronic lung disease or a weakened immune system are at greatest risk of getting sick. About 1 out of 10 people who get Legionnaires' disease will die from the infection, according to information posted online by Public Health-Seattle & King County.Monday evening [19 Sep 2016], the water system for Cascade Tower was treated with a high dose of chlorine to eliminate the bacteria from the water. Tuesday morning, the system was to be flushed to bring chlorine levels back down. Campus engineering confirmed that the plumbing system serving Cascade Tower does not cross-connect to other plumbing systems in the UW Medical Center or Health Sciences Building.Additionally, UW is calling all high-risk patients who were hospitalized in the Cascade Tower between 24 Aug and 13 Sep 2016 to educate them about the signs and symptoms of _Legionella_ pneumonia.[Byline: Coral Garnick] --Communicated by:Denis Green<legion1@q-net.net.au>[Four patients, 2 of whom have died, have been reportedly diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of _Legionella_ infection, in the cardiac care units in the Cascade Tower of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. The clinical isolates are reportedly _Legionella pneumophila_. We have also been told that _Legionella_ (the species were not specified) have been isolated from 3 heater-cooler units, an ice machine and 2 sinks in University of Washington Medical Center Cascade Tower hospital's cardiac units. Genotyping of clinical isolates will help confirm a common source, if they match each other; if the species of the environmental isolates is the same as the clinical isolates, genotyping the environmental isolates will help confirm the source of the outbreak. Heater-cooler units are used to cool blood in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. We have not been told whether any of the 4 University of Washington patients were exposed to the heater-cooler units while undergoing cardiac surgery. Contamination of the water circulating within these units has been the source of outbreaks of mycobacterial infection (endocarditis, aortic root abscess, sternal wound infection or disseminated infection) following cardiothoracic surgery in the U.S. and Europe in the past several years (see prior ProMED-mail posts below).Swiss investigators at the University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich Heart Institute, cultured a non-tuberculous mycobacterium, _Mycobacterium chimaera_, from water circuits of heater-cooler units connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass and air samples collected when the units were in use (1). RAPD-PCR demonstrated identical patterns among _M. chimaera_ strains from heater-cooler unit water circuits and air samples and strains in 2 patient clusters. The Swiss investigators concluded that airborne transmission of _M. chimaera_ from contaminated heater-cooler unit water tanks to patients occurred during open-heart surgery.Although _Legionella_ is generally regarded as a pulmonary pathogen, extrapulmonary _Legionella_ infections have been reported. Seven cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by _Legionella pneumophila_ or _Legionella dumoffii_ were reported from Stanford University Medical Center, presumably acquired within the hospital post-operatively (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM198803033180902>). The genotype of the _L. pneumophila_ isolates were identical to that of isolates from the Stanford hospital drinking water, and the _L. dumoffii_ isolates from patients with endocarditis were derived from a single strain apparently unique to this medical center, but the route of transmission was never established. The Stanford investigators then reported 3 cases of sternal-wound infection with _Legionella_, together with evidence that the infections may have arisen after direct inoculation of _Legionella_ into fresh sternal wounds during bathing of patients or dressing changes (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199101103240207#t=article>).1.

Abstract available at: <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/14/cid.civ198>.ProMED-mail would appreciate knowing whether the patients were exposed to the heater-cooler units while undergoing cardiac surgery. Did they have just pulmonary or extrapulmonary _Legionella_ infection; were the environmental isolates _L. pneumophila_, as were reportedly the clinical isolates; and was genotyping done to help delineate transmission pathways? - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>.]
