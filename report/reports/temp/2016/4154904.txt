Echo Netdaily [edited]<http://www.echo.net.au/2016/04/woman-contracts-diphtheria-at-rabbits-eat-lettuce/>The organisers of the Rabbits Eat Lettuce, which took place near Casino over Easter, have announced a festival-goer has contracted diphtheria.A rare case of the deadly bacterial disease diphtheria has been reported in the northern rivers and it appears that the woman contracted it while attending a doof [see definition below] near Casino over Easter.As many as 10 percent of diphtheria sufferers die from the disease, which is extremely rare in western countries.The woman who contracted it attended the Rabbits Eat Lettuce doof and festival organisers have informed attendees on the event's Facebook page.Stop the Australian (Anti) Vaccination Network (SAVN) spokesperson, surgeon John Cunningham, said that diphtheria was ""easily preventable in this day and age with a simple vaccination. This is a disease that we haven't seen in Australia for some years. In 2011 a 22-year-old unvaccinated Queensland woman died from the disease,"" Mr Cunningham said. ""Before that there were a handful of cases in the Northern Territory in the early nineties. It would be a tragedy if this new case had a fatal outcome,"" he added.Diphtheria is spread through coughing and sneezing, with the infected person being contagious for up to 2 weeks after infection. The incubation period for diphtheria is up to 10 days, but most commonly between 2 and 5 days. People who attended Rabbits Eat Lettuce and have subsequently fallen ill within that time period are advised to seek medical attention. Symptoms include respiratory problems, a runny nose, sore throat, hoarse voice, swollen neck glands, and fever and chills. Complications may include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), inflammation of the nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding problems due to low blood platelets. Myocarditis may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis.[Byline: Chris Dobney]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Diphtheria is now rare in Australia, in contrast to the first half of the 20th Century when at the height of the 1921 epidemic, there were 23 199 notifications (annual notification rate 426 per 100 000 population) and, in the decade between 1926 and 1935, there were 4 043 deaths from diphtheria (<http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-2000-cdi2406-cdi2406f.htm>). A school-based vaccination program began in 1932 in Australia. In 1991 to 1992 there were 23 notified cases of diphtheria, one of which was fatal (<http://www.kidspot.com.au/all-about-diptheria-and-vaccination/>). Between 1992 and 2000, there were no reported cases or deaths due to this disease. In May 2011, a Queensland woman died from diphtheria after being infected by a friend who had recently returned from overseas (<http://www.kidspot.com.au/all-about-diptheria-and-vaccination/>).For a discussion of diphtheria, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below.""The slang term doof or bush doof refers to a type of outdoor dance party in Australia and New Zealand, generally held in a remote country area or just outside big cities in surrounding bush or rainforests and similar to raves or teknivals"" (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doof>). The doof Rabbits Eat Lettuce festival occurred on 25 - 28 Mar 2016 near Casino, a town with a population of 9,629 people, in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales (NS), Australia. Casino is located 726 km (451 mi) north of Sydney (NS) and 228 km (142 mi) south of Brisbane (Queensland).Rabbits Eat Lettuce festival's website (<http://www.rabbitseatlettuce.com.au/event_info>) promoted it ""as a tribal Easter dance party on the mid-north-coast of NS and has become an underground tradition in the area, long lost brothers and sisters reconnect to dance, share stories, socialize and camp out under the stars. The event has grown a lot since its humble beginnings as a forest dance party but still holds the same essence of freedom and unique mystery it started with.""""Our magical festival village will be held in a beautiful green private valley surrounded by Sandstone cliffs. The event takes place over 4 days and has a number of stages showcasing a variety of dance music: everything from deep and serious to fresh and funky. Entertainment runs 24 hours. The festival venue is surrounded by mountains, which help to contain the sonic frequencies so the party can keep pumping through to sunrise. Regardless of your sleeping patterns, you will find a party."" - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6102>.]
