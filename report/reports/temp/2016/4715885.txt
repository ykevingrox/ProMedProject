Most of them were exposed to fish. They reported that they ate fish one day and a day afterwards started having pain in their muscles. A few patients did not remember whether they had eaten fish.There was a media release with a warning and a request to report all suspected cases.The Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health have some samples from patients, and they are still working on it.--Responding Member: Tatiana Otero Melendez, infectologist (Infectious Disease Specialist), Brazil.[Dr. Otero Melendez submitted the 1st report of these cases (see Haff disease - Brazil: susp, RFI 20161218.4706067). - Mod.MPP]******[2][Mod.RNA of the ProMED-PORT network sent a series of questions to EpiCore Surveillance Project members in Brazil. Dr. Otero Melendez sent the responses below]:Q1 - Are there any other links between initially affected families who have not consumed fish?- Most of them had eaten fish.Q2 - What is the age profile of the cases?- There are families where both children and adults are affected. I saw a family of 5 people with adults ranging in age from 30 to 40 years old and children between 4 and 11 years of age.Q3 - What is the time distribution of cases according to the onset date of the symptoms?- It depends on how much of this they ate. The mother, having eaten more of the fish, had symptoms the next day, a few hours after [ingestion of the fish?].Q4 - There was a report of fish consumption before the onset of symptoms: how long before the onset of symptoms?- It was related to the consumption of the fish; one day before.Q5 - When did the symptoms of the most recent cases start?- Approximately 18 to 24 hours after fish ingestion.Q6 - What is the attack rate among those who consumed the fish in question?- All of the patients that ate the fish had symptoms. Q7 - Was there sampling of the fish for analysis?- Not yet, because in most of the cases, all of the fish had been consumed.Q8 - Do the new cases have any links between them and/or the 1st cases?- No. There is no relationship between them.Q9 - Are these new cases, or are they older cases that have only recently been reported?- I have talked to the surveillance unit since I had seen the cases in July [2016].Q10 - Do the newer cases present with pain and laboratory abnormalities that suggest a myopathy?- Yes, they presented with very high CPKs, pain, and, in some cases, renal failure.Q11 - How long were symptoms present, and were they reflected in the lab changes?- The symptoms were present for a few days. As I said, CPK was elevated, but the leucograms were normal.There are 2 kind of fish reported to be involved thus far: Badejo and olho de Boi.Responding Member: Tatiana Otero Melendez, infectologist [Infectious Disease Specialist]--Tatiana Otero Melendez, infectologistBahia, Brazil<tatianaotero@gmail.com>[The Infectious Disease specialist is responding to questions based on the cases she has personally seen. From information provided in prior posts, it appears as though there is a leaning towards a viral etiology in some quarters. That being said, the clinical information and descriptive epidemiology provided by Dr. Otero Melendez strongly suggests this may well be an outbreak of Haff disease.Haff disease was 1st reported in 1939 in the German medical literature (Zu Jeddeloh B. Haffkrankheit [Haff disease]. Erg Inn Med 1939;57: 138-82), where it was described as ""a syndrome of unexplained rhabdomyolysis following consumption of certain types of fish; it is caused by an unidentified toxin. (Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome caused by injury to skeletal muscle that results in release of muscle cell contents into the circulation),"" (from Haff Disease Associated with Eating Buffalo Fish -- United States, 1997, CDC. MMWR. 25 Dec 1998 / 47(50);1091-3 <https://www.cdc.gov/mmWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00056038.htm>).In the MMWR article, there is a report of 6 cases of Haff disease identified (4 in California and 2 in Missouri) among persons who ate buffalo fish (_Ictiobus cyprinellus_), a bottom-feeding species found mostly in the Mississippi River or its tributaries. Checking on the 2 types of fish mentioned by Dr. Otero Melendez as having been consumed by the patients prior to onset of symptoms, the Badejo is in the _Serranidae_ family of fish, including grouper and sea bass. (<http://goo.gl/ZPzYYM>. Fish of the _serranidae_ family include some that are bottom feeders (<http://www.fishbase.org/summary/FamilySummary.php?ID=289>). The other fish I (Mod.MPP) believe is amberjack (in the tuna family). I found a picture of the fish at <http://www.bahia-guesthouse.com/Fishing-in-Imbassai.html>, and it resembles amberjack.The enigma remains as to whether the clinical picture described in the previous posts is more consistent with a viral disease leading to Bornholm disease or more consistent with Haff disease. - Mods.TG/MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.][See Also:Haff disease - Brazil (03), clarification, more cases 20161220.4710424Haff disease - Brazil (02): 20161218.4707549Haff disease - Brazil: susp, RFI 20161218.4706067From ProMED-PORTDoenÌ¤a nÌ£o identificada - Brasil (03) (BA), miopatia, surto 20161216.4704355DoenÌ¤a nÌ£o identificada - Brasil (04) (BA), surto, miopatia, atualizaÌ¤Ì£o, informe epidemiolÌ gico 20161217.4704477].................................................tg/ao/jh/mpp/msp/mpp"
