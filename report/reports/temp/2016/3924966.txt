Eurosurveillance 2016;21(1):pii=30099 [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21345>On 4 Nov 2015, a 56-year-old German businessman was hospitalized in Tubingen, Germany, with acute watery, non-bloody diarrhea (6-8x/d, no mucus), hypotension, malaise, weight loss of 5 kg and anuria. Onset of symptoms i.e. watery diarrhea (8-12x/d), slight nausea and abdominal pain, was on 30 Oct 2015 towards the end of his return flight from a short business trip to the Philippines, where he visited Subic Bay and Manila from 27 to 29 Oct 2015. He consulted his general practitioner (GP) on 2 Nov 2015, but his condition deteriorated despite increased oral fluid intake. Upon hospital admission he looked unwell, temperature and heart beats were normal, blood pressure was 70/50 mm Hg; his skin was dry, his tongue white but still moist; otherwise physical examination was normal. He was on antihypertensive medication (amlodipine 10mg, candesartan 16mg) and had a history of polycystic kidney syndrome with previously normal kidney function. He had not received a cholera vaccination prior to his trip. He had only been eating in high-standard restaurants with a variety of foods including Japanese dinner (Sashimi and other raw fish) on 28 Oct 2015 in Subic Bay, and briefly cooked/fried seafood on 29 Oct 2015 in Makati, Manila. He had consumed neither tap water nor drinks with ice cubes. He was started on intravenous rehydration therapy immediately, given intravenous metoclopramide as antiemetic treatment, and encouraged to drink as much as possible.Laboratory analyses showed creatinine of 4.4 (normal range 0.7-1.2 mg/dL), urea 80 (normal range 10-50 mg/dL), and slightly increased CRP (13 mg/L;  normal range 0-6mg/L). White blood count showed normal leucocytes with only slight neutrophilia (73 percent; normal range: 50-70 percent). Potassium and sodium were borderline low. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed a polycystic kidney disease without further obvious changes. With extensive parenteral and oral fluid and electrolyte replacement of over 5 L within the first 20 hours, he started producing urine and kidney function normalized rapidly (creatinine on 5 and 6 Nov 2015, 2nd and 3rd day of admission: 2.4 and 1.4mg/dL; urea 72 and 55 mg/dL, respectively). His antihypertensive therapy was halted during the whole hospital stay. He remained afebrile and diarrhea ceased slowly.Stool culture from 2 and 4 Nov 2015 (GP visit and hospital admission, respectively) grew _Vibrio cholera_, fully sensitive to all standard antimicrobials tested for cholera (except to nitrofurantoin). Further specification revealed O1, Biovar El Tor, Serotype Ogawa, sodB- and ctxA-positive by real-time PCR, cholera toxin in vitro production was relatively low at about 1 ng/mL compared with more than 100 ng/mL by other ctxA-positive isolates [1, data not shown]. After receiving the microbiological results, the option of antimicrobial therapy was discussed with the patient and doxycycline (300mg single dose) was given. He was discharged on 6 Nov 2015 without diarrhea or fever. Follow-up as outpatient revealed normal blood tests, including kidney function tests.Background------After an absence of cholera cases for more than 25 years [2] cholera has again become endemic in the Philippines since 1961 [3], coinciding with the beginning of the ongoing 7th cholera pandemic [4]. Cholera typically occurs in crowded settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure. Travel advice usually takes into consideration current outbreak reports, but imported cholera in returning travelers to Europe is rare [5-8].The annual incidence of cholera cases (suspected and confirmed) in the Philippines was recently calculated at 9.1 per 100 000 individuals but is likely to be higher due to under-reporting [2]. 96 percent of analyzed cholera isolates in the Philippines have been of Ogawa serotype and have shown susceptibility to 1st-line antimicrobials [2]. Case fatality was calculated at 0.62 percent and up to 2 percent in outbreaks in the Philippines [2].Mortality rates of more than 10 percent have been observed early in cholera epidemics but can be reduced to less than 0.2 percent with effective therapy [4]. Severe dehydration and hypotension can lead to renal impairment. Early antimicrobial treatment can decrease and shorten diarrhea by 50 percent and is recommended for patients with moderate to severe dehydration [4].Discussion-----There have been no documented cholera cases imported to Germany from the Philippines for more than 15 years [9]. It is noteworthy that a short business trip to and around the capital Manila would not be considered to constitute an important risk for cholera especially with recent outbreaks being reported from more peripheral areas of the Philippines [2], and the country being listed among cholera-endemic countries with the lowest incidence rates [10]. The source of infection in the present case presumably was consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked fish or seafood in high standard restaurants.Besides pre-travel advice on general water and food precautions, the German Society for Tropical Medicine and International Health (DTG) recommends cholera vaccination for travelers to areas with current cholera outbreaks [11]. Oral cholera vaccination has also been shown to provide some protection against traveler's diarrhea [12], but a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that sufficient evidence is still lacking for its use to protect travelers against diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ [13].Antimicrobial therapy and microbiological diagnosis certainly came too late to contribute to the rapid improvement of acute renal failure in our patient, instead improvement presumably resulted from simple and rapid rehydration therapy. Aggressive fluid therapy remains the cornerstone of pre-renal failure management in cholera [14]. In view of the patient's underlying kidney disease and potential benefits from antimicrobials in reducing fluid loss and duration of fecal excretion of the pathogen [15], late antimicrobial therapy was still performed.The presented case demonstrates physicians in Europe should be aware of endemic cholera not only in Haiti and several African countries but also in certain parts of Asia including the Philippines [16] and consider this in pre-travel advice. Rapid rehydration therapy is needed for returning travelers presenting with acute watery diarrhea and signs of severe dehydration.References---------------1.

The vaccine is not available for such use in the USA.  As a reminder, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is ""non-O1""), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the ""classical"" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.*****[2] Cholera - Malawi (Northern Region)Date: Thu 7 Jan 2016Source: Maravi Post [edited]<http://www.maravipost.com/health/10232-breaking-news-cholera-outbreak-has-claimed-1-and-hospitalized-4-in-karonga.html>One patient has died in Karonga in the northern part of Malawi while 4 others are receiving medical treatment in hospital after a cholera outbreak hit some parts of the district. Briefing the District Executive Committee in an emergency meeting on Tuesday, 5 Jan 2016, Karonga Environmental Health Officer Lewis Tukula said the incident occurred at Kaporo rural health center on 30 Dec 2015. Tukula therefore asked for immediate help from the well-wishers, claiming the district has no medical supplies for [treatment of] cholera.""It was on 30 Dec 2015 when the a Atupelo rural hospital in Kaporo in the north of Karonga informed us that they suspected a 4-year-old boy of suffering from Cholera due to some related symptoms. We then referred the patient to the central hospital in Lilongwe, where the doctors  confirmed that the boy was affected by the disease,"" said Tukula, adding that ""however when we followed up the boy's case this morning, we found out that his grandfather who also had the same signs was declared dead yesterday, while 3 other people within the village are also in critical condition, and then we rushed them to the hospital for treatment in an isolation room.""In her remarks the District Commissioner Rosemary Moyo pleaded with non-governmental organizations to offer help. ""As we [understand that] the hospital is experiencing a shortage of medical equipment to treat patients suspected of cholera ... we will start clearing the markets and also clearing the drainage systems surrounding the town to avoid contaminated water, which is the source of cholera,"" she added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[3] Cholera - Malawi (Southern Region)Date: Wed 30 Dec 2015 Source: Westfield Times [edited]<http://www.westfieldtimes.com/us/cholera-outbreak-hits-japanese-malawi/90737/>Malawi is experiencing an outbreak of cholera, 2 months after the start of the rainy season. Health authorities say the water-borne disease has hit residents of 3 districts around Lake Chilwa in eastern Malawi. The 1st cholera cases were reported in the eastern districts of Machinga and Zomba on 19 Dec 2015, when 1 person died and 26 others received treatment at public hospitals. Health Ministry authorities told VOA that the water-borne disease is now spreading considerably with the number of patients now at 95.Adrian Chikumbe, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, said the outbreak is largely due to poor sanitation around Lake Chilwa, Malawi's 2nd largest lake. ""You see, at Lake Chilwa, there is this tendency of people to construct houses just above the water, and then there are people fishing and all that, so hygiene is severely compromised,"" said Chikumbe.In Malawi, there is fear that the water-borne disease may spread to other districts if left unchecked. Chikumbe said the government is doing everything possible to control the outbreak. ""We have intensified community sensitization to the dangers of poor sanitation and hygiene, but we are also [working] on [the medical] supplies side, trying to give people chlorine that they should use on drinking and cooking water,"" said Chikumbe.Malawi last experienced a large-scale cholera outbreak in 2009, when more than 1000 people were infected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[4] Cholera, Somali refugee camp - Kenya (Garissa County)Date: Thu 31 Dec 2015Source: All Africa [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201512311089.html>Somalia: UNHCR Battles Cholera At World's Largest Refugee Complex----------Health workers at the world's largest refugee complex in Kenya are gaining the upper hand in battling a cholera outbreak that has killed 10 people and sickened around 1000 others since it broke out in Novemer 2015 amid rains linked to El Nino.Cholera, an often fatal water-borne bacterial illness, which causes vomiting and watery diarrhea, flared up in mid-November 2015 at Dadaab, which comprises 5 camps hosting 347 000 refugees and asylum seekers, the majority fleeing violence in Somalia.An outbreak control team comprising staff from the UN Refugee Agency and partner agencies, has worked with the Kenyan Health Ministry and Department of Refugee Affairs officials around the clock to treat cases and stamp out the disease at the sprawling complex in northeastern Kenya.Among patients brought to 1 of 4 cholera treatment centres set up at Dadaab was a 2-year-old boy, a refugee whose family fled Mogadishu, Somalia. The toddler tested positive for the illness and was admitted to the hospital, where his condition stabilized and improved after 3 days of treatment. ""We don't know what caused the cholera but thank God, he is better now. He got a lot of fluid here, I am happy,"" said the boy's 32-year-old father, who seemed satisfied with the treatment his son received in the hospital.The 4 specialized treatment centres, each of which can treat more than 50 patients, provide intravenous rehydration to those in the critical wards, who receive care around the clock from dedicated staff. ""They cannot take medicine orally, so we transfuse to hydrate and treatthem. Once they are stable, they are moved out of the critical area. On average it takes 3 days for a patient to recover and discharge,"" said Caroline, a doctor in Hagadera camp hospital which is managed by the International Rescue Committee.The 1st case of the current Cholera outbreak in Dadaab was reported on 18 Nov 2015 at the Ifo 2 camp: a 10-year-old boy who had been playing in a stagnant pool and may have swallowed some of the water. He has since been treated and recovered.The 1st camp, Hagadera, was established at Dadaab in 1991, when refugees fleeing the civil war in Somalia started to cross the border into Kenya. A 2nd large influx occurred in 2011, when some 130 000 refugees arrived, fleeing drought and famine in southern Somalia.[Byline: Assadullah Nasrullah]--Communicated by::ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[5] Cholera - Uganda (Busia District)Date: Wed 23 Dec 2015Source: NTV [edited]<http://www.ntv.co.ug/news/health/22/dec/2015/busia-cholera-epidemic-gets-worse-poor-hygiene-blame-10400#sthash.Q3RNOzva.dpbs>Busia cholera epidemic gets worse, poor hygiene to blame--------According to health officials in the district, stigmatisation, denial and poor sanitation have hindered the progress of the elimination of the epidemic which is reported to have started in Kenya.The cases of cholera in Busia district since the start of the outbreak stand at 231, with 6 deaths reported so far. 7 people have been admitted to Busia cholera center since Mon, 21 Dec 2015. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[6] Rotavirus diarrhea, fatal - Solomon IslandsDate: Thu 7 Jan 2016Source: Solomon Star News [edited]<http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/9231-diarrhea-outbreak-claims-young-lives>Diarrhea outbreak claims young lives--------The diarrhea outbreak has so far claimed the lives of 6 children in 4 provinces. Under-secretary of the Ministry of Health and Medical Service Dr Chris Becha revealed this yesterday, 6 Jan 2016.  ""Of the 6 deaths, 2 were recorded in Western Province, 2 in Malaita, 1 in Guadalcanal and 1 in Honiara,"" Dr Becha said.Since the outbreak was announced in December 2015, a total of 2100 cases directly associated with the current outbreak were recorded nationwide. Dr Becha said the deaths were all children below the age of 5.While diarrhea cases recorded in the Honiara and Guadalcanal have dropped in recent weeks, the outbreak is further recorded in other parts of the country with latest cases seen in Choiseul, Isabel, Malaita and Temotu provinces. ""There are signs that the outbreak is slowing down in Honiara and Guadalcanal, but there is an increase in diarrhea cases in Choiseul, Isabel, Malaita and Temotu,"" Dr Becha said. ""With the wide spread of the outbreak we wish to advise parents and guardians to take extra care of their children especially when it comes to hygiene to prevent them from contracting diarrhea.""Not only that, we also would like to advise parents to take their children to clinics if they see their children developing symptoms of the rotavirus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak to avoid illness or even unwanted deaths.[Byline: Biriau Wilson Saeni]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
