He also proposed a quarantine to be declared in Koropara village as well as placing the families of the affected individuals under surveillance. Another intervention measure that was adopted by the government was the launch of a vaccination campaign for medical staff who had contact with the patients as well as those who had contact with the medical staff. The government also announced the start of a door-to-door operation in the southern region to look for patients. More communication channels will be opened to prevent panic among members of the public and to communicate about prevention and protection measures, the statement concluded...22 Mar 2016 Guinea: At least 5 dead in Guinea Ebola flare-up: health officials<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3504881/At-5-dead-Guinea-Ebola-flare-health-officials.html>According to Fode Tass Sylla, spokesman for Guinea's Ebola response unit, ""Since the re-emergence of the disease, we have recorded 5 [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] deaths: 3 probable [cases] and 2 confirmed [cases].""The 3 probable deaths were people who were buried before they could be tested, Sylla said, adding that 961 people may have come into contact with the victims and would now undergo monitoring.Last week, authorities said [EVD] was suspected in the case of a married couple who died in the rural southern village of Koropara: the wife died in late February 2016, and the husband died in early March 2016. This was followed by the deaths of a 2nd wife of the same man and an 8 year old girl, thought to be his daughter. The youngster died at an Ebola treatment center after health officials were alerted to the presence of the disease. In addition, Fode Tass Sylla said a man who tested positive for EVD in the city of Nzerekore died on Mon [21 Mar 2016].The Alliance For International Medical Action, which reopened its Ebola clinic in southern Guinea on Fri [18 Mar 2016] to treat the 8 year old, told AFP it is still caring for her mother.According to Sylla, an investigation into the hundreds of people who may have contracted EVD from contact with EVD victims was under way, focusing on ""who came to (victims') burials; who paid them visits; who washed the bodies.""According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Guinean health officials had alerted it to Ebola symptoms in the family's village on [16 Mar 2016], the same day it declared a similar flare-up to be over in Sierra Leone. The village is in the same region where the 1st Ebola case of the current outbreak was registered in December 2013.[The number of individuals being monitored for Ebola in the southern village of Koropara varies with the report and goes as high as 997.

[Lofa County is in the northern-most part of Liberia, bordering Sierra Leone-Guinea.According to Fode Sylla Tass, spokesperson for the National Coordination of the Fight Against Ebola, the latest most recent case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is 200 km (373 miles) from the village where 4 other recent [EVD] deaths occurred. Spokesperson Tass said the man, who was not identified, had recently visited the village. In addition, Tass said on state television on [22 Mar 2016] an estimated 816 people who may have come into contact with Ebola victims or their corpses have been traced since Saturday [22 Mar 2016]. According to information minister Eugene Nagbe, [the closure] ""will remain indefinite until we review the situation in Guinea.""[See note above regarding discrepant numbers of individuals being traced/monitored. - Mod.LK][And see the next 3 reports]:22 Mar 2016: Liberia closes borders as Ebola resurfaces in Guinea<http://allafrica.com/stories/201603230835.html>Liberia's borders with neighboring Guinea have, again, been ordered closed with immediate effect. According to minister of information, Lenn Eugene Nagbe, the government of Liberia, the borders will remain closed until the current outbreak of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] in Guinea is addressed by Guinea authorities.Minister Nagbe said, in a [21 Mar 2016] UNMIL Radio interview, the Liberian government has already sent medical personnel and kits, as well as Ebola prevention materials, to the entire Liberian borders with Guinea.[Closing the border is nearly impossible. Education and medical surveillance would be more effective. - Mod.LKThere is no way to close the border or stop people fleeing. People who want to cross on a road will bribe the guard or else take a forest trail. And there is no way to stop people fleeing without arresting or shooting them.

Travellers bypass borders<http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/news/9899-travelers-bypass-borders>Reports from Nimba County speak of travelers commuting between Liberia and Guinea despite the official closure of borders announced by the Government of Liberia in the wake of renewed Ebola outbreak in that country...The New Dawn Nimba correspondent, who visited the border in Ganta, Nimba County says it seems like the presidential directive is not being effectively observed here as all crossing points between Nimba and Guinea are open with Liberian border security personnel, including Immigration officers, customs personnel and inspectors from the Ministry of Commerce extracting huge sums of money from travellers before allowing them to enter and leave the county.Due to the porosity of borders between the 2 countries, commuters in cohort with border security establish crossing points in bushes and along river banks to bypass the official borders. Residents of towns and villages along the unofficial crossing points have expressed fear of the virus spreading into their communities by unsuspecting travelers [...and therefore, as stated above, the dire need for improved surveillance and education. - Mod.LK].23 Mar 2016 Guinea: Villagers flee as Guinea logs 5th death in new Ebola outbreak; Liberia shuts border<http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/23/world/science-health-world/villagers-flee-guinea-logs-fifth-death-new-ebola-outbreak-liberia-shuts-border/#.VvLe2DHLLnk>According to Fode Sylla Tass, spokesperson for the National Coordination of the Fight against Ebola in Guinea, in Makoidou, news of the latest test was met with panic. ""When the villagers realized that the test conducted by our health teams on the man were positive, they all fled into the bush,"" Tass said.]22 Mar 2016: Malawi to meet Guinea despite Ebola scare<http://africanfootball.com//news/620963/Malawi-to-meet-Guinea-despite-Ebola-scare>In the presence of Ebola virus resurfacing in Guinea, the 2017 CAF Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier will be played this weekend because the resurfacing Ebola virus disease (EVD) has affected forest areas such as Nzerekore.Nzerekore, Guinea is the 2nd largest city in Guinea by population, after the capital Conakry. Nzekerokre is a commercial and economic center about 354 miles/569 km southeast of Conakry and the largest city in the Guinee forestiere (forested region) of south eastern Guinea.Mtawali's team is currently camping in Sierra Leone where they will play a practice match on 22 Mar 2016.21 Mar 2016: West Africa vulnerable to new major Ebola outbreak as vigilance fades<http://allafrica.com/stories/201603220568.html>According to Armand Sprecher, public health specialist at medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the 3 West Africa nations [Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone] impacted by Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks may find it difficult to prevent another major outbreak as vigilance weakens among health workers and the public. Sprecher also said health facilities must reinforce infection prevention and control measures or risk widening the spread of new EVD outbreaks. In addition, he said communities must also help to prevent EVD by avoiding old habits that can transmit the disease, such as eating bushmeat, caring for the ill and touching the dead, he said.Caring for the ill and preparing the dead for burial are clearly risk factors in human-to-human spread of Ebola virus, but it is impractical to expect people not to care for ill relatives and friends. And how common is eating bush meat? Bush meat, the meat of wild animals, includes hoofed animals, primates, rodents, and bats and is often the main source of animal protein available to people in parts of Africa.Excerpted from <http://allafrica.com/stories/201407240813.html> 24 Jul 2014:Communities risk future spillover from wild species that can carry the virus, including fruit bats, some primates, and duikers. FAO chief veterinary officer, Juan Lubroth, said: ""We are not suggesting that people stop hunting altogether, which isn't realistic. But communities need clear advice on the need not to touch dead animals or to sell or eat the meat of any animal that they find already dead. They should also avoid hunting animals that are sick or behaving strangely, as this is another red flag."" [However, the infected animal may be completely asymptomatic, as is the case with fruit bats. - Mod.LK]Fruit bats -- usually eaten dried or in a spicy soup -- are thought to be the most likely reservoir species for [Ebola] virus, which they can carry without developing clinical signs of the disease, and should be avoided altogether, according to FAO.""The virus is killed when meat is cooked at a high temperature or heavily smoked, but anyone who handles, skins or butchers an infected wild animal is at risk of contracting the virus,"" Lubroth said.Fruit bats belong to the family Pteropodidae. They are flying mammals that live in dense forests in Africa, Europe, Australia, and Asia. There are about 166 species of fruit bats. Fruit bats are sometimes known as flying foxes. These bats live in huge colonies, known as ""camps"". These nocturnal (most active at night) animals rest during the day while hanging upside down from their feet....Tests have shown that some species of fruit bats collected during Ebola outbreaks show the bats have the virus, but do not show any signs of it. Further studies also show that Ebola [virus] can reproduce in fruit bats and other bats in the Tadarida genus. This could mean that the bats are the source of the virus. The Marburg virus, which is related to Ebola, has also been found in fruit bats in Uganda.A few references for further reading on bats as reservoirs follow here:Leroy EM, Kumulungui B, Pourrut X, Rouquet P, Hassanin A, Yaba P, et al.
