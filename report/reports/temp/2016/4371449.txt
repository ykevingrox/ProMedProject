It was confusing to me, so I went to their primary source article (link below) from the IFRC 22 Jul [2016].My interpretation is that the number of YF cases cited yesterday, 25 Jul [2016], on ProMED for the DRC is actually the number for Angola, according to the primary source IFRC 22 Jul [2016]. Thus, recognizing your comment caveat yesterday about whether the number of YF cases (in DRC) is accurate, I would conclude that the number of cases in DRC over the past 2 weeks has NOT doubled (if it is true that this number of cases was referring to Angola).As you will certainly appreciate, the number of cases of YF is a sensitive issue in the DRC.--Dr. Daniel LuceyProMED consultant currently in Kinshasa<daniel.lucey8@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Dr. Lucey for this information.It is good to learn that the yellow fever case number in the DR Congo has not increased so much, with concern that the outbreak was accelerating. There is still concern and hope that the vaccine campaign slated for August 2016 will be timely enough to quickly halt the outbreak.ProMED regrets any unnecessary concern that the previous post (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160725.4368957) may have caused subscribers.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of the DR Congo and neighboring Angola, where the outbreak started, can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Yellow fever - Africa (87): Congo DR 20160725.4368957].................................................jw/ty/msp/lm"
