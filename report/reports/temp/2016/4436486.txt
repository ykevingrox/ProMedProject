The Arctic [edited]<http://arctic.ru/population/20160822/416004.html>As of 22 Aug 2016, 12 227 people in the Yamalsky, Tazovsky, Nadymsky and Priuralsky districts of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area have been vaccinated against anthrax, according to the regional government's website.Regular vaccination of the region's reindeer herds also continues. A total 247 353 reindeer have been vaccinated against anthrax in the region so far: 150 327 in Yamalsky District, 58 768 in Tazovsky District, 36 458 in Priuralsky District and 1800 in Nadymsky District.All those affected by a local outbreak of anthrax in one area of Yamalsky District have received preventive treatment and vaccination and have now returned to disease-free nomad camps in the traditional areas of settlement. The regional budget has allocated 90 million rubles [approx. 1.4 million USD] for building new traditional nomad homes. Material for building 60 such homes has already been delivered and the assembly work is underway. The families are living in tent settlements equipped with everything necessary while waiting for the new homes. They receive regular supplies of warm clothes and everyday household goods, including humanitarian aid collected by people across the region. Food supplies are sufficient for a month.A total of 25 veterinary specialists are taking part in the mass vaccination campaign. A total 2572 animal carcasses have been destroyed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 17 Aug 2016Source: The Arctic [edited]<http://arctic.ru/environmental/20160817/412733.html>Rescuers and military personnel involved in fighting an anthrax outbreak in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area were awarded medals For Preserving the Arctic and For Valor and Selflessness, TASS reports.""Workers of the Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian Emergencies Ministry were presented with letters of commendation and gratitude as well as medals For Preserving the Arctic and For Valor and Selflessness, both of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area. Almost 500 people and 60 units of equipment were involved in the outbreak control,"" the area's press service commented.The day before, the Defense Ministry's radiation, chemical and biological defense forces completed an operation to contain the anthrax outbreak. In less than 3 weeks, the military had discovered and burned the remains of 2572 animals killed by the hazardous infection. The team also decontaminated the 225-square-km [approx. 87 sq.mi] affected area using chloride of lime.""The disinfection and burning were completed promptly. Soon we are expecting soil sample results. The outbreak area has been fenced off with 40 000 signs and notices installed to prevent people from entering,"" the press service added.As previously reported by TASS, the Yamal District of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area has been under quarantine since 25 Jul 2016. As many as 24 tundra residents were diagnosed with anthrax after eating unprocessed reindeer meat. A 12-year-old boy died of a gastrointestinal infection on 1 Aug 2016. And 97 people from the outbreak area were hospitalized. Currently, 22 nomads are still in hospital; the others have been released.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a location of the affected area. go to the OIE report presented in archive post 20160805.4397291.Reading between the lines, it would seem that the authorities burnt the nomads' homes as they have to be rebuilt, as well as being provided with new clothes and household goods. For some reason they must have suspected extensive contamination, not improbable considering the extraordinary number of reindeer -- 2348 according to OIE -- claimed to have died from anthrax. And the Defence and Emergencies Ministries personnel have been recognised and rewarded for their hard work, and presumably sent home.The 25 veterinarians are still vaccinating reindeer, having already vaccinated an impressive 247 227 head to date -- no mean feat. If one is successfully vaccinating the reindeer and thereby stopping any new cases, I cannot see why it was necessary to vaccinate 12 227 humans when any vaccination cover for anthrax is by definition temporary. Politically important maybe, but biologically very temporary. But they claim that 225 sq. km of steppe were contaminated. The old vaccine stocks can now be replaced with fresh of course. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54849>.]
