A Norovirus Intervariant Gii.4 Recombinant In Victoria, Australia, June 2016: The Next Epidemic Variant? Eurosurveillance Rapid Communication, 21(39)------------------------------------------------------A norovirus recombinant GII.P4_NewOrleans_2009/GII.4_Sydney_2012 was 1st detected in Victoria, Australia in August 2015 at low frequency and then re-emerged in June 2016, having undergone genetic changes. Analysis of 14 years' surveillance data from Victoria suggests a typical delay of 2-7 months between 1st detection of a new variant and occurrence of a subsequent epidemic linked to that variant. We consider that the current recombinant strain has the potential to become a pandemic variant.Norovirus strains can be highly adaptable, escaping herd immunity and thus continuing to infect the community over long periods. There is evidence that the emergence of new global epidemic variants and their subsequent global spread is rapid, with almost simultaneous detection worldwide [1-4].GII.4 noroviruses cause ca. 70-80% of all human norovirus-associated gastroenteritis worldwide [5], and pandemics of norovirus infection occurred in 1996, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2012, all caused by the emergence of new GII.4 variants [1,6]. No new pandemic strain has emerged since the GII.4_Sydney_2012 variant [5], which has been the predominant strain in Victoria, Australia, since its emergence in 2012, although there is a report [7] of an altered form of the Sydney_2012 variant (referred to as the Sydney_2015 variant) detected over the past 12 months in the United States. The report [7] appears to be based only on partial capsid sequence, and it is unclear whether Sydney_2015 is the GII.P4_NewOrleans_2009/GII.4_Sydney_2012 recombinant.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>
