The Express Tribune[edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1152693/first-case-2016-patient-tests-positive-congo-fever/>A patient at Holy Family Hospital (HFH) [Rawalpindi, Punjab] tested positive for Congo fever on [Sat 30 Jul 2016].The 62-year-old man was brought to the hospital 4 days ago from Choha Saiden Shah in Chakwal [district, Punjab] with a high fever.The hospital suspected it could be dengue fever and sent samples for testing to the National Institute of Health. The results showed that he was suffering from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).He was said to be in stable condition with no active bleeding. HFH Medical Superintendent [MS] Dr Raja Shafique Sarwar said the patient was in stable condition but was being kept in an isolation ward to avoid spreading the potentially deadly viral infection.He said that it was the 1st Congo fever case treated at the hospital this year [2016]. The MS said that the hospital received 7 cases in 2015 and 8 cases in 2014. He said that there were no deaths attributed to the disease last year [2015], but it did claim 4 lives in 2014.Sarwar said that doctors had also placed medical staff who had attended to [the patient] under observation as a precaution.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[CCHF virus is mostly distributed in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Since the diagnosis of the 1st human case of CCHF in 1976, sporadic cases have continued to occur across Pakistan. The occurrence of this virus is correlated with the distribution of _Hyalomma_ spp, the principal tick vector. CCHF is now endemic in Pakistan, and 40-60 cases and isolated outbreaks are reported from different geographical areas of the country (<http://nih.org.pk/files/Newsletter/Seasoanl%20Awareness%20and%20Alert%20Letter%20(SAAL)%2034th%20Issue.pdf>).The majority of CCHF cases are reported between June to October every year.A hospital outbreak was reported last week in Bahawalpur in southern Punjab, which resulted in 2 deaths and an ongoing outbreak investigation (see Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (04): (PB) RFI 20160730.4381868).This underlines the fact that virus transmission also needs to be monitored on the veterinary side through animal and tick surveillance to facilitate mapping of 'hot' zones for CCHF. - Mod.UBAMaps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/825 >. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
