We have an increase of 27 percent in the number of suspected cases as compared to last week, although the case fatality rate is declining and that is thanks to the response by the humanitarian partners."" --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. These 2 posts differ widely in both the total number of presumed cases and the number of deaths. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but numbers are likely to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman.Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
