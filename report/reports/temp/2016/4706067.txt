I live in Salvador de Bahia.In July [2016] I saw a family with rhabdomyolysis related to fish ingestion. I thought about Haff disease.This week a [news] release, a warning, talking about similar symptoms, and I think we have an outbreak.--Tatiana Otero<tatianaotero@gmail.com>[Haff disease, rhabdomyolysis after ingesting certain types of fish, was 1st reported in 1924 in Europe. There have been a limited number of cases reported in the United States, and more farther south to Brazil and throughout Brazil. Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis can occur after eating cooked buffalo fish purchased at a suburban grocery market, or fresh from markets or the ocean. This suggests the substance responsible for rhabdomyolysis is not changed, denatured, or altered by the heat of cooking. A toxicological agent has not been identified. If there is an outbreak of this disease in Brazil we would appreciate an authoritative comment regarding the situation. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.].................................................tg/je/lm"
