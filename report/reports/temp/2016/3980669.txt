Food Safety News [edited]<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/01/123015/#.VquuFvnhDIU>As federal officials reported new illnesses in a 7-month listeriosis outbreak linked to packaged salads from Dole, the company clarified its recall of all products from its production plant in Springfield, Ohio.As of [Wed 27 Jan 2016], 15 people across 8 US states had been confirmed in the outbreak. The most recent case was diagnosed [3 Jan 2016], according to a [Thu 28 Jan 2016] update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All have required hospitalization and 1 died.In Canada, public health officials report 7 people across 5 provinces have been infected. 1 person died, but it has not yet been confirmed that listeriosis was the cause.""Laboratory tests performed on clinical isolates from ill people in Canada showed that the isolates are highly related genetically to _Listeria_ isolates from ill people in the United States,"" the CDC reports.On [Tue 26 Jan 2016], Dole Food Co. of Westlake Village, California, posted a statement indicating its ""voluntary withdrawal"" a week earlier of all products from its Springfield facility amounted to a recall. ""Voluntary recall is a specific term used by the Food and Drug Administration. While our actions under a voluntary recall as compared to the previously reported voluntary withdrawal remain the same, we have updated our communication terminology to reference a 'recall,' "" according to the Dole company statement. ""We have done this with the aim of using terminology that may be more familiar to consumers.""The federal definition of ""recall"" indicates a company knows consuming a product could cause ""serious adverse health consequences or death."" The term ""withdrawal"" indicates ""a minor violation that would not be subject to legal action by the FDA or which involves no violation.""Dole reports all retailers across 23 states and 3 Canadian provinces that received products from the Springfield, Ohio, facility had been contacted as of [27 Jan 2016].Health officials did not link the Springfield facility to the outbreak -- which dates back to at least July 2015 and is ongoing -- until earlier this month [January 2016], when a lab test of a packaged salad collected in Ohio returned a positive test result for _Listeria monocytogenes_. That _Listeria_ strain matched samples uploaded from outbreak victims to federal disease databases.The recalled salads include a variety of mixes of leafy greens and other fresh cut vegetables. They are packaged under the brands: Dole; Fresh Selections; Simple Truth; Marketside; The Little Salad Bar; and President's Choice Organics.Dole distributed the salads to retailers in these US states and Canadian provinces: Alabama; Connecticut; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Indiana; Kentucky; Louisiana; Michigan; Massachusetts; Maryland; Minnesota; Missouri; Mississippi; North Carolina; New Jersey; New York; Ohio; Pennsylvania; South Carolina; Tennessee; Virginia; Wisconsin; Ontario; New Brunswick; and Quebec.[Byline: Coral Beach]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail recently reported on the multi-province Canadian listeriosis outbreak suspected to be due to listeria-contaminated pre-packaged leafy vegetables or mixed salads, in which 7 people fell ill between September 2015 and the beginning of January 2016 (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Canada: fatal, pre-packed vegetables susp, RFI 20160122.3956200). This time period overlaps that of the US listeriosis outbreak reported by CDC, due to packaged salads (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - USA, Canada: fatal, recall, pre-packed salads, RFI 20160123.3960428).The news report above says that genotypes of clinical isolates from ill people in the Canadian listeriosis outbreak match those from the US outbreak. Both outbreaks were linked to packaged salads produced at the Dole processing facility in Springfield, Ohio.For discussions of listeriosis, please see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
