The Frontier Post [edited]<http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/407090//>The Ministry of Public Health said [on Sat 10 Sep 2016] that at least 12 people have died from Congo fever [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, CCHF] in Afghanistan in the past year and that 71 cases of the disease have been reported across the country in that time. Last week [week of 5 Sep 2016] the ministry, along with the ministry of agriculture, irrigation and livestock, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) issued a warning to the public about the disease particularly over Eid [Eid-al-Adha, Festival of the Sacrifice].In a press release issued by the authorities, they said Congo fever is primarily transmitted to people from ticks or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. This is of particular concern over Eid-al-Adha as hundreds of thousands of people will be slaughtering animals and the risk of the virus transmission is expected to increase.Meanwhile, the ministry of agriculture, irrigation and livestock, said it was also struggling with other livestock-related problems. ""Livestock is faced with traditional problems in the country, but there has been a number of changes in breeding animals and regarding their health in recent years,"" said Mohammad Ibrahim Frotan, head of disease prevention and control department of the agriculture ministry. Kabul residents meanwhile called on government to provide them with more information on contagious diseases between animals and human.""The public health ministry does not pay enough attention to this matter. There is no laboratory to diagnose the disease. It should assess the situation,"" said Mirwais, a resident of Kabul. ""We know the veterinary doctors. We call them and they come and prescribe medicine for our cattle. We have not seen any diseases among our cattle,"" said a cattle seller in Kabul.According to the ministry of public health, the symptoms for Congo fever include fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and sensitivity to light.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Based on the report above, there are limited or no diagnostic services available for human cases in the country, which could be an impediment to confirmation of clinical cases and timely response measures.CCHF is a disease endemic to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran as well as central Asian states; cattle and personnel movement between the 1st 3 countries has led to the importation of vectors as well as cases (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959153>).As animals with CCHF viremia do not exhibit clinical disease or morbidity, the control measures would principally include vector mapping by geographical regions and measures for vector control and increasing awareness among the high risk groups. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/137>.]
