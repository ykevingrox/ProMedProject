El Nuevo DÌ a [in Spanish trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.elnuevodia.com.co/nuevodia/tolima/regional/284693-casos-de-leishmaniasis-siguen-en-aumento-en-el-sur-del-departamento>In several localities of Planadas municipality (Tolima department), the community is fearful about the possible proliferation of leishmaniasis, said Wilington GutiÌ©rrez, president of the Community Action Board [JAC by its initials in Spanish] of the Bilbao corregimiento [subdivision of a municipality].The number of people affected [by leishmaniasis] has been increasing in recent weeks, and the most recent case that raised alarm was the death on [Tue 22 Mar 2016] of a 48-year-old man from the village of Las Lomas, who [apparently] had suffered from the disease for the past month. He had concluded the treatment the day before his death but complications could have developed. According to GutiÌ©rrez, however, the disease has not been medically confirmed.GutiÌ©rrez said also that leishmaniasis has spread during the past 3 years in several villages of Planadas (Tolima): La IlusiÌ n, La Betulia, San Jorge, Buenos Aires, and Porvenir, and is now found in La Loma, Recreo, La Esperanza, Rioblanco, and Chaparral.In the recent National Institute of Health epidemiological bulletin, Tolima ranks second nationally with 74 reported cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Rioblanco is one of the localities with the highest number of affected persons.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Leishmaniasis, both visceral and cutaneous, are endemic in Colombia. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is not lethal and therefore it must be assumed that the case reported here was visceral leishmaniasis, but there is no information on any diagnostic procedures, genotyping, or possible reservoirs like dogs or rodents. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving detailed information from knowledgeable sources in the region - Mod.EPMaps of Colombia can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/colombia_pol_2001.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52579>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
