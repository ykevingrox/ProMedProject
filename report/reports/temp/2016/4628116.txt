Kutesa, the Mawogola North Constituency MP, said Sembabule should be listed among the districts hit by the hepatitis B outbreak for immediate redress.The locals led by the Lugusulu LC3 chairman, Fred Karakure told Kutesa that the affected residents have failed to access health care to contain the outbreak. ""Our people suffering with the hepatitis B outbreak, does not have access to treatment. We are finding it difficult to meet costs of handling the disease at Byansi Clinic in Masaka, we need [the] government's intervention,"" he said.A total of 12 people tested positive for hepatitis B out of the 53 who were screened in Sembabule according to the DHO, Dr Charles Matovu. He said the district drew the matter to the attention of the Centre of Disease Control (CDC) authorities for redress. Dr Matovu said the hepatitis B prevalence in Sembabule district has hit 21 percent. New Vision learned that the prevalence of hepatitis B was 1st detected in Sembabule last month [October 2016] during the UPDF [Uganda People's Defence Force] recruitment exercise when several candidates were disqualified for testing positive for the disease.The Government has rolled out a massive vaccination against hepatitis B in 25 out of the 39 districts hit by the disease. The disease outbreak is high in the Western and Northern regions according to Health Minister, Ruth Aceng.Responding to the locals in Sembabule who asked [the] government not to scrap health centres at parish level, Kutesa said the matter should be reviewed to retain health centre II facilities which are serving high populations. The locals also expressed concern over the high rate of absenteeism at health centres in the district. The Sembabule RDC Henry Baguma said some of the health staff work in shifts which is wrong. He said the medical staff at the health centres abandons work to do their side businesses. Baguma said he has been making abrupt visits in health centres as a strategy to fight against staff absenteeism.[Byline: Dismus Buregyeya]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not clear if what is being seen is a significant numbers of people who are chronically infected with hepatitis B, if these are all cases of acute hepatitis B or, most likely a mixture of the 2. The most relevant test to distinguish the 2 forms of HBV is IgM antibody against HBcAg (the HBV core antigen). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24902>.]
