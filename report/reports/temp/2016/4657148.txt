Right now, we have a team of between 50 and 60; that's counting Americans who are permanently stationed in the 3 countries plus some locally employed staff and also some staff [from] CDC traveling there temporarily to assist.""This kind of cooperation has proven to be helpful in dealing with the latest minor outbreaks, says CDC's Liberia country director, Dr Desmond Williams. ""In March, we had a case again in a remote part in Guinea. One of the contacts from that family moved down to the capital city of Liberia, Monrovia,"" Dr Williams said. ""But because the 2 governments were ready this time, we were able to limit that outbreak to 13 infected people and 9 people dead.""Dr Williams told VOA [Voice of America] that the agency's field epidemiology program has trained significant numbers of surveillance officers in Liberia, at the national, county and district levels, but the most important work has been developing laboratory capacity, so health care workers are able to diagnose [Ebola virus disease, EVD] infections rapidly...][Building laboratories and increasing human capacity on top of good surveillance is a strong public health approach. A lot has been learned, and a lot of training has taken place. If this can be sustained, rapid response to emergence of Ebola and other hemorrhagic viruses should go a long way to controlling virus transmission. - Mod.LK]See video:22 Nov 2016 West Africa: Doctors in US, Africa work to contain future Ebola outbreaks<http://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-in-us-africa-work-to-contain-future-ebola-outbreaks/3606662.html>25 Nov 2016 Guinea: Guineans more trusting of doctors, hospitals since Ebola<http://www.voanews.com/a/guineans-more-trusting-of-doctors-hospitals-since-ebola/3611177.html>[Traditional healers who treat the ill are, after the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, more likely to use more western approaches (such as chlorine bleach) in their work.

According to Matt Scullion of BioFire Defense: ""Tests would take 2 or 3, sometimes 4 days to get results back to hospitals. In the meantime, you had malaria patients in with Ebola patients, and if you didn't have Ebola before, you'd be likely to have Ebola after.""But as Ebola was multiplying unchecked across large areas of West Africa, a rapid-testing kit that had been in the works for years was ready to go at BioFire Defense, more than 10 000 km away in the western United States. The US firm, a subsidiary of a large French biomedical corporation, focuses on innovative technologies to help workers in the life sciences identify pathogens quickly and easily...FilmArray is now one of 7 diagnostic tools the World Health Organization has approved for emergency use. According to the inspector general of Guinea's Health Ministry, Aboubakar Sidiki Diakite: ""Before, we had to transport samples to Dakar, Senegal, or Lyon, France. But today, thanks to our partners in France, CDC in the US, and many others, we are able to make rapid diagnoses for EVD.][Rapid diagnosis is a key component of controlling spread of the virus, as infected individuals can be more quickly separated from individuals presenting with similar symptoms from other diseases. - Mod.LK]Economy-------25 Nov 2016 Nigeria: firms in bid to secure Nigeria oil contracts<http://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00047511.html>About 224 companies, hundreds of them indigenous Nigerian firms, are seeking to secure contracts for the sale and purchase of Nigerian crude oil grades on offer in 2017. [Nigeria's economy is heavily dependent on income from oil sales. The country is the largest African crude oil supplier to India; it annually exports 400 000 barrels per day to India valued at USD 10 billion annually. India is the largest purchaser of Nigerian oil, which fulfills 20 per cent to 25 per cent of India's domestic oil demand.][compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.ProMED-mail/HealthMapsLiberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>. - Mod.LK][See Also:Ebola update (67): news, research, funding 20161120.4642402Ebola update (66): news, research, funding, economy 20161115.4629793Ebola update (65): news, research, commentary, economy, funding, vaccine 20161106.4609611Ebola update (64): news, research 20161030.4595759Ebola update (63): news, research 20161023.4579436Ebola update (62): news, research, treatment, funding 20161017.4564066Ebola update (61): news, funding, economy 20161009.4547627Ebola update (60): news, research, economy 20161002.4531285Ebola update (59): news, research, funding 20160925.4514591Ebola update (58): news, research, funding, vaccine 20160918.4497393Ebola update (57): news, research, funding 20160911.4481043Ebola update (56): news, vaccine, research 20160904.4465145Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116].................................................lk/msp/sh"
