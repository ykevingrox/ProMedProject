CDC, _Salmonella_ Homepage, 2016 Outbreaks [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/montevideo-03-16/index.html>CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Montevideo infections. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC, is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.A total of 11 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo have been reported from 9 states: Alabama (1), Arizona (2), Connecticut (1), Georgia (1), Michigan (1), Minnesota (1), North Dakota (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (2). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 12 Dec 2015 to 9 Feb 2016. Ill people range in age from 9 years to 69, with a median age of 31. 73 percent of ill people are male. Among 9 ill people with available information, 2 reported being hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.Investigation of the outbreak-----------------------------Collaborative investigative efforts of state, local, and federal public health and regulatory officials indicate that pistachios produced by Wonderful Pistachios of Lost Hills, California are a likely source of this outbreak.In interviews, ill people answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of the 9 ill people who were interviewed, 8 (89%) reported eating pistachios in the week before illness started. This proportion is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 12% reported eating pistachios in the week before they were interviewed. When asked about the brand of pistachios eaten, 5 (63%) of 8 ill people reported eating Wonderful brand pistachios.Recent laboratory testing isolated the outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo from samples of raw pistachios collected from Paramount Farms, where Wonderful pistachios are grown.Investigators are using WGS [whole genome sequencing] to get more information about the DNA fingerprint of _S._ Montevideo causing illness. WGS showed that isolates from ill people are closely related genetically. In addition, WGS showed that isolates from raw pistachios supplied by Paramount Farms are also closely related genetically to isolates from ill people. This close genetic relationship provides additional evidence that ill people in this outbreak became ill from consuming pistachios produced by Wonderful Pistachios.On 9 Mar 2016, Wonderful Pistachios voluntarily recalled a limited number of flavors and sizes of in-shell and shelled pistachios because they may be contaminated with _Salmonella_. The pistachios were sold under the brand names Wonderful, Paramount Farms, and Trader Joe's and were sold nationwide and in Canada.This investigation is ongoing, and we will update the public when more information becomes available. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview those people about foods they ate before they got sick.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There are no reports as yet of cases occurring in Canada but the recall extends there. Where along the food chain the pistachios (a tree nut) were contaminated is unclear. Plants, such as tomatoes, can be colonized in vivo with human pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and _Salmonella_ sp. Whether this occurs in large trees, is unclear. A publication discussing this issue is cited below. Brandl MT, Cox CE, Teplitski M: _Salmonella_ interactions with plants and their associated microbiota. Phytopathology. 2013; 103(4): 316-325; <http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PHYTO-11-12-0295-RVW>Abstract--------The increase in the incidence of gastroenteritis outbreaks linked to the consumption of foods of plant origin has ignited public concern and scientific interest in understanding interactions of human enteric pathogens with plants. Enteric disease caused by nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ is a major public health burden, with the number of cases of illness linked to fresh produce, spices, and nuts surpassing those linked to foods of animal origin. Mounting evidence supports the hypothesis that colonization of plants is an important part of the life cycle of this human pathogen. Although plant responses to human pathogens are distinct from the more specific responses to phytopathogens, plants appear to recognize _Salmonella_, likely by detecting conserved microbial patterns, which subsequently activates basal defenses. Numerous _Salmonella_ genes have been identified as playing a role in its colonization of plant surfaces and tissues, and in its various interactions with other members of the phyto-microbial community. Importantly, _Salmonella_ utilizes diverse and overlapping strategies to interact with plants and their microflora, and to successfully colonize its vertebrate hosts. This review provides insight into the complex behavior of _Salmonella_ on plants and the apparent remarkable adaptation of this human pathogen to a potentially secondary host. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
