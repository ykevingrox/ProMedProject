Saudi MOH [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2016-01-25-001.aspx>As of 12 PM today [25 Jan 2016] there have been a total of:1289 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection including:551 deaths [reported case fatality rate 42.7 percent],731 recoveries,4 currently active cases,3 asymptomatic cases.On 24 Jan 2016, there were 2 newly confirmed infections in Alkhumra, both of whom had a history of contact with camels:One is a 21-year-old expat male, the other is a 45-year-old expat male. Both were reported to be asymptomatic [details available at <http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2016-01-24-001.aspx> - Mod.MPP].No additional cases, deaths or recoveries were reported today [25 Jan 2016].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[While specific information is not provided, I suspect that these 2 newly confirmed infections were in individuals working in the camel farm in Alkhumra where 11 infected camels were identified (see MERS-COV (08): Thailand ex Oman, Saudi Arabia corr 20160124.3962172, and MERS-CoV (07): Saudi Arabia 20160123.3959982 for more details on the camel outbreak).Another change has been added to the MOH website this week showing the number of new cases reported with history of direct or indirect contact with camels and those without history of contact with camels. It's interesting that of the 15 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Nov 2015, only 2 (13.3 percent) were reported as secondary healthcare acquired cases, whereas 13 (86.7 percent) were reported as primary cases with history of contact with camels.A map showing the location of Alkhumra can be found at the source URL.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Thailand ex Oman (more details) - media report, RFIDate: 25 Jan 2016Source: Bangkok Post [edited]<http://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/tourists-and-expats/837572/ministry-confirms-second-mers-case>The Public Health Ministry on Sunday [24 Jan 2016] announced the country's 2nd confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).The patient is a 71-year-old man from Oman who travelled to Thailand last Friday [22 Jan 2016] after he was treated at a hospital in that country for about one week for fever and a cough, according to Public Health Minister Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn.The man tested positive for [the MERS-CoV] at Bumrungrad and Chulalongkorn hospitals.The man was referred to the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute on Saturday [23 Jan 2016] at 6:20 pm, and another laboratory test by the Medical Science Department confirmed he had contracted [MERS-CoV].Dr Piyasakol said the Omani man is now being quarantined at the Institute's Diseases Control Department.The Public Health Ministry is looking for people who had contact with the patient. They include a relative who accompanied the man, 218 crew and passengers who are still in Thailand, a taxi driver, a hotel employee, and 30 hospital staff.These people will be kept under close surveillance for 14 days. Of this group, 37 are categorised as high-risk. They are the patient's relative, 23 air passengers, the taxi driver, the hotel employee, and 11 hospital staff, Dr Piyasakol said. Those in the high-risk grouping will be quarantined, he said.Government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has been informed of the latest case in Thailand and asked Thais not to panic about it because steps in place to detect the disease and prevent its outbreak are effective and internationally recognised.Maj Gen Sansern said the prime minister asked people to pay more attention to their own health. If they have a fever, a cough, a feeling of vibrations in the chest when breathing and diarrhoea, they should consult a doctor or call the Disease Control Department hotline at 1422 around the clock. ...Thailand confirmed its 1st case of [MERS-CoV infection] on [18 Jun] last year [2015]. The patient was also a 75-year-old male who travelled en route from Oman to Thailand. He was treated and declared free of the virus and was eventually allowed to leave the kingdom. The disease did not spread to any other person.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This article was included as it contained more information on this case than was available in earlier press releases. Of interest is that the patient reported was ill and hospitalized in Oman for a week preceding the travel to Thailand, a similar history as given by the 1st reported case in Thailand, also from Oman, back in June 2015 (see prior ProMED-mail reports listed below). The 1st reported case (a 75-year-old male) had travelled to Thailand for treatment of a ""heart condition"" (travel that is referred to commonly as ""medical tourism"") and had a history of having been hospitalized in Oman prior to travel to Thailand. Information on this current case (a 71-year-old male) indicates that apparently he was also hospitalized in Oman prior to travel to Thailand for medical treatment (type of treatment sought not presently available). One can't help but wonder whether these individuals were infected while in the hospital(s) in Oman, having sought medical care initially for other medical reasons, or whether they were hospitalized for MERS-CoV-consistent symptoms in Oman. Either explanation suggests that there is quite possibly undiagnosed MERS-CoV illness occurring in Oman resulting in healthcare associated transmission.Of additional note is that Oman reported its 7th confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in a 44-year-old male on 4 Jan 2016 (see prior ProMED-mail reports listed below). It would be of interest to know whether the current case (the 71-year-old male traveller to Thailand) had been admitted to the same hospital in Oman where the 44-year-old case had been admitted. More information on the epidemiologic investigation of this case in both Thailand and Oman would be greatly appreciated.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Oman is available at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/124>,The HealthMap/ProMED map of Thailand is available at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151>. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Thailand, airport screening - media reportDate: 25 Jan 2016Source: Bangkok Post [edited]<http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/838696/suvarnabhumi-isolates-middle-east-flights-for-mers-checks>Airports of Thailand Plc (AoT) has reserved 2 concourses at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport for flights from the Middle East to effectively screen passengers for Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS].AoT president Nitinai Sirismatthakarn said on Monday [25 Jan 2016] that as another MERS patient had arrived in Thailand from the Mideast, planes arriving from the region would now be directed to concourses E and G.There, special screening stations equipped with thermal scanners and staffed by experienced officials were set up to observe the condition of each passenger, he said.In addition, AoT and disease-control officials asked airlines and the Airline Operators Committee to help pre-screen passengers travelling from where [the MERS-CoV] has spread so those with suspicious symptoms could be treated quickly. Passengers on such flights would receive written instructions and warnings related to [MERS-CoV.]The measures were implemented at Suvarnabhumi airport because most flights from the Middle East landed there, Mr. Nitinai said.AoT also is screening passengers at its airports in Bangkok (Don Mueang airport), Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phuket and Songkhla (Hat Yai airport) provinces where thermal scanners were applied to identify travellers with high temperatures, he said.Finally, hand sanitisers were distributed in airport areas where travellers gathered, including information booths, form-filling spots and taxi stands. Workers were cleaning surfaces people touched, such as luggage trolleys and handrails, Mr. Nitinai added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to one of the Thai websites, in 2012, there were approximately 664 000 tourists arriving in Thailand coming from the Middle East (see <http://www.thaiwebsites.com/tourism-income-Thailand.asp> and <http://www.thaiwebsites.com/tourists-nationalities-Thailand.asp>. Official data from the Tourism Authority of Thailand is not available for years after 2007 <http://www2.tat.or.th/stat/web/static_download.php?Rpt=cre>). This contrasts with statistics contained on a Wikipedia report stating that Suvarnabhumi airport handled over 53 million passengers in 2012 (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suvarnabhumi_Airport>), an enormous undertaking, especially since concourse E and G are also used for flights not arriving from the Middle East (I have arrived from further east in Asia at gates on concourse E and G in Suvarnabhumi airport).
