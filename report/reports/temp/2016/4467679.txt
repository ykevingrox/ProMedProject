O Hoje [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.ohoje.com.br/noticia/cidades/n/122919/t/febre-amarela-mata-75-das-vitimas-em-goias>Yellow fever has killed 75 percent of the people who contracted the disease in Goias in the period between January 2015 and August 2016. There were 8 confirmed cases. Of these, just 2 people survived according to the State Secretariat of Health (SES).These SES numbers did not include a death in Goias that is still under investigation by the agency, but was confirmed by tests of the Municipal Secretariat of Health (SMS). The number takes into account the death of a 27-year-old man who resided in the Northeastern Region of the capital, with a case fatality rate of 77 percent.In 2015, the cases were concentrated in Goias North Region, in the municipalities such as SÌ£o Miguel and Alto ParaÌ so. This year [2016] the cases are concentrated in the center of the state. The 3 suspected cases were reported in GoiÌ¢nia, Senador Canedo, and SÌ£o Luiz de Montes Belos.The Goiania SMS intensified its vaccination efforts against the disease in the capital. The SES biomedical specialist on yellow fever Helio Filho understands that this is extremely important in order to deal with a situation for which there is prevention.He stated that the 2 cases which occurred in Goias were from the northern state of Bahia. ""One of our concerns is about tourists and people from regions where vaccine coverage is not recommended, such as the Northeast Region and costal areas of the country,"" said Fihlo.--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 31 Aug 2016Source: O Globo [in Portuguese, trans.

The work will continue until December [2016] when hundreds of farms in 15 communities must be visited. According to the State Secretariat of Health (SES), this year 8 people have died, victims of the disease in the state.The focus of the [vaccination] campaign is to immunize the population that doesn't always have access to health posts, such as the 56-year-old rural farmer, resident of CearÌÁ, who had never been vaccinated against yellow fever. ""[He had] never needed to take it because he was not at risk, but not here in this region, which has a lot of vegetation, a lot of water around and the mosquito can be close to us. Now we will be protected,"" he said.Another point that concerns the populace is the abundant presence of monkeys, which can be hosts of the disease [virus]. ""Thank goodness I received the vaccine and now I am relaxed,"" said a rural farmer.According to SES, at the beginning of this year [2016], a rural worker from Cumari, a farm in the same region, died, a victim of yellow fever. He was a 38-year-old who lived with a family on a farm. ""Everyone needs to have this vaccine against yellow fever today, since this is the main protection against the serious disease,"" said the coordinator of the vaccination campaign, Luciana Martins.--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[The 8 cases were confirmed and, according to the news, [there are] 6 deaths. Information on when there have been cases and deaths is conflicting -- have cases occurred between 2015-2016 or only in 2016 (as suggested by the 2nd report)? Apparently all the cases involve sylvatic [forest] transmission. Information about people-dates-places is scarce and imprecise. Anyway, the concern is: given the continuous transmission since 2015, the high case fatality, cases distributed in different regions of the state, if suspected in the capital [Goiania], the population still non-immunized ...Additional information will be welcome. - Mod.RNAThe sylvatic transmission cycle of yellow fever virus transmission involves monkeys (the reservoir host) and forest mosquitoes. This transmission cycle occasionally spills over to humans. Dead monkeys are frequently found where sylvan transmission occurs, although there is no mention of dead monkeys here. Sylvan YF has occurred frequently in Brazil, including in Goias state. - Mod.TYMaps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3168>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
