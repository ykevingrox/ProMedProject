""It's the biggest outbreak in the district. We are studying why it is happening.""""All children in the district will be vaccinated against JE on [1 Dec 2016],"" Odisha director of health services Dr Chittaranjan Nayak said. ""The process of procuring the vaccines from the Centre, training the staff and the logistical assessment has begun.""A single shot protects children for up to a year against the JE [virus] strain prevalent in India.While JE is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes, AES can be caused by a range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, chemicals, and toxins. Encephalitis is marked by inflammation of the brain's membrane that causes rapidly rising fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.Odisha first reported encephalitis cases in 2015, when 660 AES cases and 33 JE cases were detected. There were 4 deaths, 2 from each.""Children in Malkangiri have never been vaccinated against JE because there were no cases till now,"" says Dr Nayak. Till [2 Oct 2016], India reported 7443 AES cases and 840 deaths, while JE has infected another 974 people and killed 167. Of these, 456 AES and 16 JE cases were from Odisha.[Byline: Sanchita Sharma]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of encephalitis cases in the district continues to slowly increase. This is the 2nd time that acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been mentioned. Until now, almost all the encephalitis cases have been attributed to JE virus infections. AES cases go undiagnosed. When JE virus infection is ruled out, other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. Until definitive etiologies of AES are identified, appropriate treatment and control measures cannot be implemented. One hopes that the studies that Dr Madan Mohan Pradhan mentioned will determine the etiologies involved.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY******[2] Vaccination trainingDate: Tue 2 Nov 2016Source: Prameya News7 [edited]<http://www.prameyanews7.com/en/nov2016/odisha/35541/Training-to-vaccinators-for-JE-immunisation-begins-JE-immunisationOdisha.htm>The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) authorities on [Wed 26 Oct 2016] started imparting training to nodal officers of 4 [Odisha] districts, Malkangiri, Koraput, Keonjhar, and Jajpur to carry out immunization programme to tackle deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE).The deadly disease so far claimed the lives of 82 children in Malkangiri district. [According to the report above, less than half of these cases are due to JE virus infection. - Mod.TY]The exact date of vaccination is yet to be decided by the NVBDCP, but it is believed that vaccination drive against Japanese encephalitis (JE), a dreadful disease, would be organised either in the last week of November or 1st week of December [2016].As part of vaccination drive, children in the age group of 1-15 [years] would be covered across the 4 districts. Action plan has drawn for effective implementation of JE vaccination programme in these districts.Vaccine camps would be set up in Government schools besides Anganwadi centres [Anganwadi centers provide basic health care in Indian villages. - Mod.TY]. Children in the age group of 1-15 years are prone to Japanese encephalitis attack and there is no medicine to cure this viral disease. Sources said JE vaccination is free from all side effects.It is advised vaccinators not to administer JE vaccine for those children who are suffering from fever and infectious diseases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not clear why the vaccination initiative has waited over 3 months to be organized, while the number of fatal cases has gradually increased. It is good to see that training has finally begun, but the vaccination effort itself is still 3-4 weeks off. JE vaccination will not prevent occurrence of AES cases, but the significant number of JE virus infections with fatalities still justifies the vaccination effort. - Mod.TY]
