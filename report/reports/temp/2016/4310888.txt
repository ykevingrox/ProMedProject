Pallonate [in Italian, machine trans., Mod.TY, edited]<http://pallonate.com/2016/06/26/zecche-allarme-sette-persone-in-ospedale-per-lencefalite.html>In the beginning of the [transmission] season, there are 7 persons with encephalitis already hospitalized at San Martino. From 1994 to date are 194 reported cases there, slightly less than half of those registered throughout the country.The vaccine is free for those who work for the community (members of mountain rescue, civil protection, etc.), because the region bears the costs. There is an alarming upturn in the spread of ""tick bite encephalitis"", which corresponds to a very low percentage of vaccinated individuals in Belluno [Veneto region].From the epidemiological point of view, today tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is present in endemic foci in many countries of central and eastern Europe, including Italy, and North Africa.After the tick bite which infects humans, in 70 percent of cases, infection occurs with little or no relevant symptoms, which may go unnoticed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases in Italy are not unusual, this is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted. As mentioned above, central and eastern European countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur yearly there. Castor bean ticks, _Ixodes ricinus_, are the main vectors that transmit TBE virus to people. Presumably, the public will be warned of this risk and advised of measures to avoid tick bites and be vaccinated as people become more active out of doors with the onset of warmer weather.The Standing Commission on Vaccination Recommendations at the Robert Koch Institute recommends vaccination against TBE for people who live or work in areas at risk of TBE and who are at risk of tick bites, and for people in endemic areas for other reasons if they are at risk of tick exposure. - Mod.TYMaps of Italy can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/italy/regions.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10435>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ].................................................ty/mj/lm"
