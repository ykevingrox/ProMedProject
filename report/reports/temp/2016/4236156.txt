Health department of KPK has deputed a team of doctors including livestock people to investigate the matter and conduct health education sessions in the area.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[The CCHF virus is tick borne and can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians, as mentioned in the above report. Exposure in health care facilities can occur, which is why there is a constant concern for training health care workers who are in contact with suspected CCHF cases. Perhaps it is time to work on formulating awareness messages to reach the susceptible groups in the general public such as livestock handlers, and butchers as well, so that exposures can be minimized. - Mod.UBA][ProMED-mail is grateful to our EpiCore member for sharing this information with us. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19537>.]
