Times-Union [edited]<http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Saratoga-Legionnaire-s-outbreak-expands-to-18-10631698.php>The state's investigation into an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Saratoga Springs area [New York State] has expanded to 18 patients, up from 13 early this month.A total of 11 of the patients had either stayed at or visited the Wesley Health Care Center during the period when they would have contracted the disease. Nursing home officials have identified 5 sources of water contaminated with the legionella bacteria that cause the pneumonia-like illness, and have taken action to remediate the problems.Two of the patients have died, and the family of one, 86 years old, has threatened a lawsuit. Up to 7 other infected patients, however, have been neither residents nor visitors to the nursing home, according to the state Health Department.State investigators have not found a source of legionella bacteria outside of Wesley. Their probe has included 15 cooling towers, large air conditioning systems known to breed legionella, within a mile of the Wesley campus, as well as construction on the municipal water system, according to the Health Department.Legionella bacteria do not [usually] spread from person to person, but are usually breathed in, often through a mist. ""Investigations of clusters of legionellosis are often not able to identify a common environmental source,"" the state Health Department stated. Legionellosis is a term that includes lung infections caused by legionella bacteria, including legionnaires' disease.State investigators have not been able to collect samples of phlegm from any of the patients with legionnaires' disease, the Health Department said. Such samples are required for a definitive match to the source of legionella, according to the agency.The state implemented new regulations for testing and maintaining cooling towers after an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Bronx [New York City] last year. The 4 cooling towers on the Wesley campus were in compliance with those new rules, according to the Health Department.[byline: Claire Hughes]--communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project member Jack Guzewich[We thank Jack Guzewich, an EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member, for submitting this news report.The news report says that the outbreak in Saratoga Springs, New York has expanded from 13 to 18 cases and they were unable to collect sputum samples on the 18 cases; therefore the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was likely based on the urinary antigen assay for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, not culture. Without clinical isolates of legionella, they have been unable to do genotyping to establish if there is a common strain for all the cases or if the genotype of a clinical isolate matches the genotype of an environmental legionella isolate, which could establish that environmental facility as the source for that patient.The news report says that the 5 possible sources for the outbreak on the Wesley campus have been remediated, but we are not told when remediation occurred in relation to the occurrence of the cases. If cases are still occurring more than 14 days (upper limit for the incubation period of legionnaires' disease) after remediation was complete, additional sources may still exist. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.]
