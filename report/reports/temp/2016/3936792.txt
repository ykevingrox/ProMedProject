In April 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the swine flu pandemic, gradually raising the level of threat.On 11 Jun 2009, for the 1st time in more than 40 years, WHO officially announced the introduction of the highest level of pandemic threat of the rapid spread through the world of influenza A(H1N1).More than 19 000 cases of infection with H1N1 flu with fatalities have been registered, and infected people were found in most countries of the world, according to WHO.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[""Swine"" influenza H1N1 is actually a seasonal influenza, as discussed previously in ProMED-mail postings. Although the media regularly refer to the virus as ""swine flu,"" the term is misleading. An informative source on H1N1 can be found at <http://www.flu.gov/about_the_flu/h1n1/>. The disease is preventable as the virus is included in the human vaccine.The symptoms of H1N1 influenza include sore throat, a headache, overall body pain, a runny nose, coughing and difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea and a high fever.Patients with exacerbating co-morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal insufficiency and cancer are among those most at risk of contracting severe influenza H1N1. It is highly recommended that such patients take the influenza vaccine as a protective measure and for anyone in contact with them to frequently wash their hands and use face masks to avoid the spread of infection.The virus reached Turkey in May 2009. A U.S. citizen, flying from the United States via Amsterdam, was found to be suffering from the swine flu after arriving at Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport [1]. Turkey was the 17th country in Europe and the 36th country in the world to report an incident of swine flu.The Turkish government took measures at the international airports, using thermal imaging cameras to check passengers coming from international destinations [2].The 1st case of person-to-person transmission within Turkey was announced on 26 Jul 2009.On 2 Nov 2009, the Turkish Health Ministry began administering vaccines against H1N1 influenza, starting with health workers [3].After a slow start, the virus spread rapidly in Turkey and the number of cases reached 12 316 [4]. The 1st death was confirmed on 24 Oct 2009 and the death toll reached 627 [4].References:[1] ""First case of swine flu confirmed in Turkey"". turkishny.com. 16 May 2009.
