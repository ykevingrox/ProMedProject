The child had not been vaccinated against meningococcus, notwithstanding the reiterated offers to do so, in the course of the campaign launched by the Tuscan health service in an effort to curb the morbidity by the hypervirulent strain which, since 2015, has already caused 60 cases in a limited part of the region, with 7 deaths.Two other fatal cases occurred in the province of Naples, Campania: an 18-year-old in Agerola and a 46-year-old in Naples. The news reported that _N. meningitidis_ was involved in the youngster.A further, unrelated case of meningitis has been reported in a 34-year-old Peruvian woman residing in Chiavari, province of Genova, Liguria, presently in critical condition at the San Martino hospital of Genoa.In the past week, the death from meningitis at the Gemelli hospital of Rome, of a primary school teacher, had activated the protocol for the tracing and prophylaxis of the contacts, which was stopped after the agent involved was identified as _Escherichia coli_.References [in Italian]:<http://www.lastampa.it/2016/12/29/italia/cronache/altri-due-casi-di-meningite-dopo-quello-di-roma-muore-un-enne-nel-napoletano-rmq9xbs7hQqqQPz7H1TFcP/pagina.html><http://firenze.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/12/29/news/firenze_bambino_muore_di_meningite_c_non_era_vaccinato-155044879/?ref=HREC1-5><http://corrierefiorentino.corriere.it/firenze/notizie/cronaca/16_dicembre_30/muore-meningite-fulminante-d6818b66-ce6d-11e6-b534-47d649da6f06.shtml> <http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/napoli/cronaca/16_dicembre_30/napoli-ha-febbre-alta-muore-caso-sospetta-meningite-39a4b794-ce74-11e6-b534-47d649da6f06.shtml>--Pasquale UrbanoFormerly: Dept. of Public Health, University of FlorenceFlorence, Italy<rbnpql@gmail.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Prof. Urbano for his updates on meningococcal meningitis in Italy. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>.]
