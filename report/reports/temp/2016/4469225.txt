Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/venezuela-malaria-crisis-antimalarial-drugs-out-of-stock-worst-epidemic-in-75-years-94939/>In 2015, Venezuela saw a record number of malaria cases with 136 402, the most reported in 75 years, since reliable records have been kept in the country. However, the situation is much worse in the South American country during the first 33 weeks of 2016.The ""Sociedad Venezolana de Salud Publica Red Defendamos la Epidemiologa"", or the Venezuelan Society of Epidemiology and Public Health reported today that through 20 Aug 2016, Venezuela has seen 143 987 cases of malaria, representing an increase of 72.2 percent over the previous period in 2015 (83 623).""In total, 3635 new indigenous cases were identified in epidemiological week No. 33 of 2016, from 14 to 20 August"", says the statement of the Venezuelan Society of Epidemiology and Public Health. Of the total of indigenous cases in the country, 9.5 percent (or 13 758 cases) were in children under 10 years old. Bolivar, the large state in eastern Venezuela, bordering Brazil and Guyana, still accounts for the majority of cases 114 963, or nearly 8 out of 10 cases.Of immediate concern are reports that indicate that the antimalarial drug, artemisinin, essential for the treatment of the most pathogenic strain of malaria, _Plasmodium falciparum_, is running low in stock. In Bolivar, where the epidemic is most severe, drug stocks are depleted as are diagnostic supplies like Giemsa stain and immunological rapid tests. Of the 106 countries globally with continuous malaria transmission, 102 reduced the annual incidence between 1990 and 2015 by 37 percent . Venezuela is part of the group of 4 countries that has seen an increase in the incidence of malaria, in fact, the incidence increased by 356 percent in Venezuela.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Thanks to Leopoldo Villegas, MD, for providing the information and data concerning this epidemic in Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is alarming and completely out of control and now not even the standard drug used to treat _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria, Artemisinin, is available. With 143 987 cases so far this year [2016], 72 percent more compared to the same period in 2015 the explosion in the number of malaria cases is a national emergency, which probably need external assistance to bring under control. Drugs for treatment do not bring the transmission under control. For this, sustained vector control and identification and treatment of carriers are needed. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29>.]
