Mainz-Bingen District press release [in German, submitter SZ, edited]<http://www.mainz-bingen.de/deutsch/aktuelles_presse/pressemeldungen/20161120_hasenpest.php> Six human cases of TularemiaThe health authorities of the Mainz-Bingen district [Rhineland-Palatinate] are investigating several cases of human tularemia infection. The disease can be transmitted from animals; human to human transmission is not known. The disease can be efficiently treated but cases can be severe.All 6 patients had been harvesting grapes at the beginning of October 2016 in the northern part of the district. A couple of days later high temperature combined with a severe overall feeling of sickness was observed. The cases are unusual because infections with the pathogen (_Francisella tularensis_) are very rare in Germany and clusters of infection are even rarer.Humans become infected through direct contact with diseased animals, their organs or excretions. The pathogen can be transmitted through contaminated food as well.The health authorities' investigation is assisted by the state lab (LUA). The focus of the investigation is on how the patients harvesting grapes could have become infected. In addition, the federal Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) is performing tests on samples collected from the vineyard. The focus is on food, hare/rabbit droppings, and environmental samples.Tularemia is caused by the pathogen _F. tularensis_. The 1st signs usually are sores at the site of infection inoculation, followed by influenza-like symptoms with fever, swelling of local lymph nodes, chills, and headache. The infection can be treated with antimicrobials.Medical practitioners in the Mainz-Bingen district are alerted and are asked to consider tularemia in patients with fever or swelling of lymph nodes, especially when the reason for symptoms cannot be established. They are required by law to notify the health authorities of suspect cases.--communicated by:Sabine ZentisCastleview English LonghornsGut LaachD-52385 NideggenGermany<http://www.cvlonghorns.de><cvlonghorns@aol.com>[The following information was obtained from The Center for Food Security & Public Health, Iowa State University, fact sheet on tularemia, available at <http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/tularemia.pdf>:""Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that can affect many mammals. Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family _Francisellaceae_. A total of 4 subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp _holarctica_ (type B) is much more widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. _mediasiatica_ and _F. tularensis_ subsp _novicida_, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed. With rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere. This disease has been reported from North America, Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and northern Africa.""Among the Northern Hemisphere, _F. tularensis tularensis_ is seen almost exclusively in North America and has very rarely been isolated in Europe. Contrarily, _F. tularensis holarctica_ is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. This species is responsible for nearly all cases of tularemia outside North America. It co-exists with _F. tularensis tularensis_ in North America. _F. tularensis mediasiatica_ occurs in a limited area of Central Asia, and _F. tularensis novicida_ has been reported from North America, Australia and Spain.""Humans acquire _F. tularensis_ from various sources including lakes and streams, food contaminated by the carcasses of infected animals or their excretions, laboratory cultures or clinical samples, and tissues from infected animals. Hunting or skinning animals, or contact with meat when preparing food, are important routes of exposure. Respiratory infections sometimes occur in farmers who are exposed through activities such as piling hay. Cases have been reported after mowing lawns, possibly from running over an animal carcass. Human infections have also been linked to handling infected animals or being bitten by them. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported.""ProMED-mail would like more information regarding whether pneumonia was present, whether any regional lymph node enlargement was present and additional information about the epidemiology here and how the diagnoses were made (culture or serology). Clusters of cases may be related to aerosol exposure or common ingestion of contaminated foodstuff or water.Mainz-Bingen is a district (kreis) in the east of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The state (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland-Palatinate>) itself is located in western Germany and borders Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, and the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Baden-WÃŒ rttemberg, and Saarland.
