The Indian Express [edited]<http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jaundice-outbreak-no-respite-for-shimla/>[Another 4] people have succumbed to jaundice in the last 60 hours in Shimla [district of Himachal Pradesh], taking the death toll in the outbreak to 11. Over half of the families in the town have also been affected by the disease in the past 2.5 months. The latest patient to pass away was a leading high court lawyer who died on Saturday morning [20 Feb 2016]. He had been referred to PGI [Postgraduate Institute] Chandigarh from IGMC [Indira Gandhi Medical College] 3 days ago. ""[He] had tested positive for hepatitis E. His condition did not improve,"" said Dr Ramesh Chand, senior medical superintendent at the IGMC in Shimla.The 3 other victims are a 74-year-old-man, who died at IGMC on Friday night [19 Feb 2016]; the 25-year-old wife of a lawyer, who passed away on [Thu 18 Feb 2016]; and [another] lawyer who also died on [Thu 18 Feb 2016].The outbreak has been traced to contaminated water being supplied to Shimla from the Ashwani Khad, the rivulet that is the town's main drinking water source. The contamination has been caused by sewage making its way into the rivulet as the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at Malyana has been non-functional. Shimla Mayor Sanjay Chauhan had the supply of water from Ashwani Khad stopped in December 2015.[Byline: Ashwani Sharma]--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[The following discussion (with the citations removed) regarding various strains is from Kamar N, Bendall R, Florence Legrand-Abravanel F, et al: Hepatitis E. Lancet 2012; 379(9835): 2477-88; <http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61849-7/fulltext>:""Molecular characterization of various HEV [hepatitis E virus] strains circulating among human beings and animals has led to the recognition of 4 major genotypes, representing a single serotype. HEV1 and HEV2 are restricted to human beings and transmitted via contaminated water in developing countries. HEV1 occurs mainly in Asia, and HEV2 in Africa and Mexico. HEV3 and HEV4 infect human beings, pigs, and other mammalian species and are responsible for sporadic cases of autochthonous hepatitis E in both developing and developed countries. HEV3 has a worldwide distribution. By contrast, HEV4 mostly occurs in southeast Asia, but has recently been isolated in European pigs. Although HEV3 and HEV4 infections have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat, the full range of species that are reservoirs for HEV is still unknown. On the basis of full-length genome-sequence analyses, HEV genotypes have recently been characterized in rats in Germany, wild boars in Japan, and farmed rabbits in China. HEV1 can be classified into 5 subgenotypes, HEV2 into 2, HEV3 into 3, and HEV4 into 7. Phylogenetic analyses show that HEV subgenotypes circulating in human beings and animals in the same area are closely related, supporting zoonotic transmission. Studies of the evolutionary history and population dynamics of HEV show that HEV has evolved through a series of steps, in which the ancestors of HEV might have adapted to a succession of animal hosts leading to human beings.""Although generally considered to cause only acute infection, the review article also discusses chronic hepatitis E, which is defined by persisting HEV RNA in serum or stools for 6 months or more, in immunosuppressed patients. Most cases have occurred in solid-organ-transplant recipients. Additionally, a few cases have been reported in individuals with HIV and patients with hematological disorders receiving chemotherapy. Chronic infection with HEV1 or HEV2 has not been reported.Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1547>.Himachal Pradesh (literally ""snow-laden region"") is a state in North India, forming part of the larger Punjab region, and can be found on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh#/media/File:India_Himachal_Pradesh_locator_map.svg>. - Mod.LL]
