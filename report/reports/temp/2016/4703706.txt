Noticia al Dia [in Spanish, trans. Kathryn Soderholm, edited]<http://noticiaaldia.com/2016/11/la-malaria-aumenta-a-734-con-la-historia-cifra-de-200-000-casos-nuevos-autoctonos/>The malaria epidemic in Venezuela has increased to 200 000 new autochthonous cases as of 5 Nov [2016].This was communicated in a statement from the Venezuelan Society of Public Health's Epidemiology Defense Network, which reads that the uncontrolled increase and accelerated expansion of the 2015 malaria epidemic has reached 136 402 cases, a record high in the 75 years since reliable records have been kept.""Now, in the 1st 44 weeks of the year, up to 5 Nov [2016], 199 902 new autochthonous cases of malaria have been reported, representing an increase of 73.4 percent over the previous year (115 313),"" said the scientific society.The analyses are based on the comprehensive bulletin of the Environmental Health Directorate. In all, 3202 new autochthonous cases were identified in epidemiological week 44 of 2016, from 29 Oct to 5 Nov. The cases so far reported greatly exceed the number accumulated throughout the year 2015.The cumulative Annual Parasitic Incidence (IPA) of the country, adjusted to the population that resides in areas of continuous transmission, reached a record number of 22.9 cases per 1000 inhabitants.The percentage of disease caused by each parasite is as follows: 76.08 percent from _Plasmodium vivax_ (152 087 cases); 18.61 percent from _Plasmodium falciparum_ (37 203 cases); 6.12 percent from mixed infections, _P. vivax_ + _P. falciparum_ (12 239 cases); and 0.001 percent (20 cases) from _Plasmodium malariae_.Of 24 federal states, 17 (70.83 percent) are on alert or already struck by the epidemic. Zulia state occupies the 6th place in the country with more cases accumulated according to the last bulletin.""Bolivar state accumulated 75.43 percent of the reported cases (150 797); Amazonas, 18 794 cases (9.40 percent); Sucre, 16 227 cases (8.11 percent); Delta Amacuro, 7486 cases (3.74 percent); Monagas, 4391 cases (2.19 percent); and Zulia, 1538 cases (0.76 percent),"" reads the document.The indigenous cases in Aragua state (which had not seen a case for more than 20 years) were identified in the coastal population of Chuao, Santiago MariÌ±o municipality. This new active area is certainly an extension of the active area of Vargas state (Parish Carayaca), as expected. No new cases have been reported in this outbreak in the past 22 weeks.""To the cases previously identified in the Miranda state, in the municipalities BriÌ n (Higuerote) and AndrÌ©s Bello (San JosÌ© de Rio Chico) in the Barlovento region, 103 new indigenous cases were added in the municipality of Paz Castillo of the valleys of Tuy (St. Lucia). The trend has been declining in the last 14 weeks after applying control measures. However, the epidemic has spread to other municipalities in Miranda state,"" said the experts.The epidemic outbreak in Vargas state, which increased to 104 accumulated autochthonous cases (3 more cases in the last 10 weeks), is the highest number of autochthonous cases in that state in 11 years. The 1st cases were identified after the holiday of Holy Week, in the town of Puerto Cruz, Carayaca parish, in which 94 indigenous cases have been identified. The disease has spread to the parishes of Catia La Mar, MaiquetÌ a, La Guaira and Caraballeda, after the introduction of cases in the month of March, from the mines of Bolivar state.""For decades, a similar situation has not occurred, with autochthonous cases in Caracas and surrounding towns of Miranda, Aragua and Vargas states,"" said the scientific society.The number of cases reported in Machiques de Perija, J.M. Semprum, Mara, and, more recently, ColÌ n (Zulia state) is 56 percent higher than in 2015.The experts call on the Ministry of Health to give extreme urgency and priority to the control of the epidemic, considering that the measures applied in the last 3 years have not been effective. There is risk of expansion of regions of continuous transmission as is currently occurring in the states of Vargas, Miranda, Monagas, AnzoÌÁtegui, Apure, Barinas and Zulia.""The figures mentioned above do not include the high number of unregistered or relapse cases of malaria, so the magnitude of the problem is much greater. It is estimated to be between 25 and 30 percent higher than the official figures,"" they concluded.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As pointed out in the report, the reported number of cases most likely represents a huge underreporting as many cases are treated without being reported. The situation is aggravated by the drug shortage in the country (reported by ProMED on 6 Sep 2016; see archive no. 20160906.4469225).It took 30 years to bring malaria under control (not eradicate it) from 1920 to 1949 in Venezuela (discussed in Malaria - Venezuela: increase countrywide 20160817.4421525), illustrating that once the infection is again established in the population, it will need long-term investments in the form of manpower and funds to bring it under control again. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29>.]
