The News [edited]<http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2016/03/7-lassa-fever-suspects-on-the-run-in-taraba/>Seven suspected Lassa fever patients on admission at the Federal Medical Centre in Jalingo, capital of Taraba State, have vanished. Dr Aisha Sani, Chairperson, Lassa Fever Committee at the medical centre disclosed this today [24 Mar 2016], saying that government is making frantic efforts to arrest the suspects.Sani said: ""Seven persons had absconded. We are making frantic efforts to arrest and bring them back to the hospital before they infect others with the disease. We have our internal securities here, but the truth is that we need more to secure the Lassa fever unit.""So far, the deadly Lassa fever has claimed 14 lives in the state from January 2016 to date [24 Mar 2016]. About 80 people have died in Nigeria, overall.According to Aisha, of the 49 suspected cases of the disease reported in the hospital, 21 persons were treated and discharged. The doctor said laboratory tests had so far confirmed 4 cases of the disease, while 4 suspected cases were referred to the Institute of Lassa Fever Research and Control, Irrua, Edo.""The 4 patients had already developed kidney failure, and you know we don't have a dialysis section here. Let me use this medium to appeal to the Federal Government to provide a dialysis unit in this hospital so that we can save lives,"" she said.Aisha said the hospital was currently handling 2 cases of the disease, adding that the worst affected areas in the state were Jalingo, Ardo-Kola and Bali local government areas.The FMC officially confirmed the 1st death of 3 persons with Lassa fever disease on 5 Jan [2016].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Lassa fever is endemic in many of Nigeria's states, including Tabara. Apparently, the 7 patients who fled the hospital became infected before they were admitted and not in the hospital.The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.), as was likely the case with these infected individuals. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients, as depicted in a photograph in the above report, are essential for safety. That is why the hospital is anxious for the 7 infected individuals who fled to return to the hospital where they can be placed in isolation. If they have returned to their homes, family members attending them and in contact with blood and other bodily fluids are at risk of infection themselves.Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. There has been no indication that a village-level control effort has been initiated yet.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
