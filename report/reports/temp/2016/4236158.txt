WHO, Influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update -- 263 (based on data up to 1 May 2016)--------------------------------------------------------Summary-------Influenza activity in the northern hemisphere continued to decrease. A predominance of influenza B virus activity continued to be reported in most of the northern hemisphere and in some tropical areas. In a few countries in the southern hemisphere, slight increases in influenza-like illness (ILI) activity were reported.- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease with influenza B detections predominating.- Europe and temperate Asia reported decreased influenza activity with a continued predominance of influenza B virus activity.- In North Africa, influenza activity continued to decrease in general, except in Egypt where in recent weeks influenza B activity continued.- Influenza A virus was reported predominant in Eastern and Western Africa.- In Central America and the Caribbean countries, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained generally low, although levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus activity remained elevated in El Salvador and Guatemala. Active circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was also reported in several countries in the Caribbean.- In parts of tropical South America, low but increasing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was reported in Bolivia and Ecuador. In Peru, influenza detections decreased. In Brazil, influenza activity continued at elevated levels with a predominance of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity remained elevated in Colombia.- In tropical countries of South Asia, influenza activity decreased with influenza B virus predominant.- In temperate South America, respiratory virus activity remained low. ILI activity increased slightly in a few countries but remained below seasonal thresholds.- In the temperate countries of Southern Africa and Oceania, influenza virus activity remained low. Some islands in the Pacific reported increased ILI activity.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 90 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 18 April 2016 to 1 May 2016 (data as of 13 May 2016 03:33:09 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 85 968 specimens during that time period. 12 819 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 4580 (35.7 percent) were typed as influenza A and 8239 (64.3 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1728 (81.5 percent) were influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 and 391 (18.5 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 353 (20.6 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 1358 (79.4 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Overall, globally, influenza activity remained low during the reporting period, except in some countries in South America. Influenza B activity has increased. Not much difference from the last global update. No novel influenza subtypes were reported either. - Mod.UBA]******[2] Unusual increase in activity in Nashville, Tennessee, USADate: Wed 18 May 2016Source: WDEF [edited]<http://www.wdef.com/2016/05/18/unusual-spring-flu-outbreak-nashville-area/>Û The flu is making an unusual late season comeback in the Nashville [Tennessee] area. Vanderbilt University Medical Center reports a borderline outbreak now. An infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt tells WSMV-TV that they have seen ""a truckload of influenza type cases this spring."" This has been a mild flu season overall in Tennessee.But Vanderbilt officials report their cases from 7 Mar to 9 May [2016] have been double what they were last year [2015].The CDC national flu report does show an elevated number of cases in the southeast region.The flu vaccine you got last fall should still cover you in the spring. This year it has been effective for 60-70 percent of cases.[Byline: Collins Parker] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[The unusual increase in cases reported from Nashville, Tennessee, appears to be part of a regional surge in the southeastern United States, and the pattern may be monitored in coming weeks. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4344>.]
