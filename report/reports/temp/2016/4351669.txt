During a study, the tick was also detected in 9 out of 36 field localities in the Bothnian Bay area in Sweden.The taiga tick has never before been recorded that far north and dog owners in the region said their dogs became tick-infested for the 1st time 7-8 to years ago. Moose, hares, domestic dogs, and ground-feeding birds are the most likely carriers of taiga ticks in northern Sweden, the report said.The taiga tick is closely related to the most common tick species in Sweden, the [castor bean tick,] _Ixodes ricinus_. To a layman they look identical, Thomas Jaenson, a professor in medical entomology at the Uppsala University, told Swedish Television.""It's hard to tell the difference,"" said Jaenson, ""You need a good microscope. But they behave differently. Among taiga ticks it is often the adult females who suck blood from humans whereas among the 'common' [castor bean] tick it is more often the nymphs.""The tick more commonly found in Sweden, the [castor bean tick,] _Ixodes ricinus_, spreads a form of TBE disease that has an average 1 percent mortality rate. By comparison, the taiga tick spreads a more aggressive and dangerous form of the disease called Far Eastern, which can have a mortality rate of up to 30 percent.The Far Eastern disease has been recorded in Estonia and has caused several deaths in Russia.So far, researchers have found no signs of Far Eastern disease in Finland or in Sweden, but there is a chance it could come there via birds who are either infected themselves or who carry the tick, Jaenson said.He added the taiga tick thrives in cold climates and could spread to other parts of Sweden, beyond the Bothnian Bay area.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Sweden has had cases of the European TBE subtype in the past. Although the arrival of the taiga tick is of concern, the good news so far is that there is no indication that far eastern TBE subtype virus has arrived with it. However, with the real possibility of additional introduction of this tick into Sweden, there is the risk that the more virulent virus will come with it, as well. In the meantime, the taiga tick very likely will expand its range in the country, as the report above indicates. Intensification of surveillance of both tick and virus would be prudent. - Mod.TYMaps of the area can be seen at <http://www.livinginthebalticsea.com/baltic_sea/files/baltic_sea_subdivisions.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54347>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
