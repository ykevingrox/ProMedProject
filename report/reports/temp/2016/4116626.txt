The majority of patients acquiring this infection are over the age of 65, and all patients have a history of at least one underlying serious illness. At this time, the source of these infections is unknown and the Department is working diligently to contain this outbreak.As part of the outbreak investigation activities, DPH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are conducting site visits and collecting environmental samples from both private residences and health care facilities. CDC is also assisting Wisconsin with testing of samples from a variety of potential sources, including health care products, water sources and the environment. To date, none of these have been found to be a source of the bacteria.The Department has alerted health care providers, infection preventionists and laboratories statewide and provided information as well as treatment guidance for this outbreak. After that initial guidance was sent, there has been a rapid identification of cases and healthcare providers have been able to treat and improve outcomes for patients.Elizabethkingia infections believed to be associated with this outbreak reported to DPH*:Case counts between 1 Nov 2015 and 23 Mar 2016---------------------------Confirmed / 52Under investigation / 3Possible cases** / 4---------------------------Total cases reported to Wisconsin DPH / 59*This investigation is ongoing.
