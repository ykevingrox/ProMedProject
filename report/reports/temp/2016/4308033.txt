Most had not received the MMR vaccine.Consultant in Public Health with the HSE Dr Fiona Ryan said they were ""looking to raise public awareness around the signs and symptoms of the condition and ensure that anyone with concerns addresses them immediately in order to receive a rapid diagnosis"".She added: ""This in turn allows the HSE HPSC Public Health teams to be fully responsive and in a position to implement all necessary control measures.""Dr Ryan stressed that ""measles is highly infectious, and if cases are isolated early, the risk of transmission to vulnerable individuals decreases"".""The time between exposure to the virus and developing measles rash is normally 14 days (range 7-21 days). People are infectious from 4 days before rash starts until 4 days after.""According to the HSE, people who are fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are normally protected.Those most at risk are those who are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR, babies (younger than 12 months -- and therefore too young to be vaccinated), and those with weakened immune systems.Measles symptoms include:- High fever- Cough- Runny nose- Red eyes- Red rash that starts on head and spreads down the body (this normally starts a few days after onset of illness)This is the advice from the HSE for anyone who develops symptoms:- Stay at home and phone their GP - Tell the doctor or nurse that they think they might have measles- Stop visitors coming to the house to prevent spreading the infection--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] New ZealandDate: Tue 21 June 2016Source: The Southland Times [edited]<http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/81287207/measles-outbreak-prompts-calls-for-parents-to-immunise-kids-in-deep-south>Measles outbreak prompts calls for parents to immunise kids in deep south-------------------------------------------------------------------------Southern parents are being urged to get their children immunised following a measles outbreak further north.Southern District Health Board [SDHB] medical officer of health Keith Reid said there had been 71 confirmed cases of measles in the North Island and Nelson Marlborough.The outbreak had spread to the top of the South Island so it was important parents in the SDHB area, covering Southland and Otago, got their kids vaccinated, Reid said.One in 6 of the 71 people who had contracted measles had been hospitalised.Pneumonia and serious inflammation of the brain were known to be associated with measles, Reid said.The Ministry of Health wanted 95 per cent of children aged 8 months to have completed all their immunisations.In the SDHB area, 94 per cent of 8-month-old children had received all their vaccinations in the May quarter. However, 3.6 per cent of parents turned down the offer to get their children immunised and about 1.6 per cent had opted out of the immunisation register.For 2-year-old children, the immunisation coverage in the May quarter was 93 per cent in the SDHB area, with 5.4 per cent of parents declining to get their children immunised and 1.4 per cent opting out of the immunisation register, Reid said.He was concerned by the number of parents opting out.""We are developing a plan to try and better understand why parents don't get their kids vaccinated.""He also encouraged people aged 10-29, who had not received 2 measles vaccinations, to contact their GP to get it done.""It's a funded vaccine,"" Reid said.SDHB deputy commissioner Richard Thomson, speaking at a health board committee meeting on Tuesday [21 Jun 2016], questioned whether parents were asked by the SDHB why they were refusing to get their kids immunised.""And what's the action we [SDHB] take with that individual?""Thomson was promised answers by SDHB bosses at next month's [July 2016] committee meeting.There was a continuing misconception in the community that there was a link between immunisation and autism, Thomson said.Immunisation Advisory Centre director of research Helen Petousis-Harris, speaking after the meeting, said vaccination rates needed to be maintained at about 95 per cent, or some of the more infectious diseases could not be controlled.""The only way to eliminate the diseases or keep them under control is to maintain high immunisation coverage.""No vaccine was 100 per cent protective and some people could not be vaccinated for medical reasons, while others refused to have it done.There had never been a link between vaccinations and autism, she said.However, No Forced Vaccines co-ordinator Katherine Smith said there was a new documentary in the USA about how a whistle blower scientist from the Centers for Disease Control admitted he and his colleagues covered up data showing that some children immunised with measles, mumps, rubella vaccines were at increased risk of autism.No Forced Vaccines supported parents' rights to make vaccination decisions on behalf of their minor children, she said.[Byline: Evan Harding]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of New Zealand can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>. - Mod.LK]******[4] USA (Arizona)Date: Wed 22 Jun 2016Source: KTAR [edited]<http://ktar.com/story/1131906/new-case-of-measles-near-phoenix-brings-area-total-to-18/>New case of measles near Phoenix [Arizona] brings area total to 18------------------------------------------------------------------The number of confirmed measles cases in Arizona has reached 18 on Wed [22 Jun 2016] with another reported in Pinal County.Of the confirmed cases, only 1 has been in Maricopa County; all the rest have come in neighboring Pinal County, where the majority of diagnoses have been traced to a private detention facility, according to the state Department of Health Services.The center is in Eloy, Arizona.In late May [2016], 7 inmates and 4 workers were infected.At the time, county health officials said they isolating patients and vaccinating detainees.
