Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty [edited]<http://www.rferl.org/content/kazakhstan-anthrax-deaths/27813225.html>A state forensic laboratory in central Kazakhstan has confirmed that 2 villagers in the Qaraghandy [Karaganda] region have died as a result of anthrax infections. The Qaraghandy region's Deputy Governor Shagurashid Mamalinov on [22 Jun 2016] said tests confirmed that _Bacillus anthracis_ -- the bacterium that causes the infectious disease -- were present in samples of raw beef that were being sold for human consumption in the village of Erkindik.Mamalinov said both of the villagers who died, along with 6 other residents of Erkindik who have been hospitalized since [19 Jun 2016] with anthrax infections, had bought the meat from a neighbor.The village has been quarantined and medical personnel were working there to prevent the disease from spreading.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), domestic and wild animals -- such as cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer -- can become infected by inhaling or ingesting spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. The CDC says all types of anthrax infections can cause death if they are not treated with antibiotics.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 22 Jun 2016 14:17Source: Kaz Tag, The Kazakh Telegraph Agency [edited]<http://www.kaztag.kz/en/news/detail.php?ID=468977>Quarantine announced in Yerkindyk village, Karaganda region, whose inhabitants had been hospitalized with assumption of anthrax, reports the operative-dispatch service of the region.""Yes, everything is closed there -- quarantine.

We have identified the people who had contacted with the family (where a sick animal was butchered -- KazTag), or had even theoretical contact with the meat of the animal. 62 people are under control, they are inhabitants of the village. They are getting prophylactic anti-bacterial treatment. They are not sick,"" said Yerzhan Nurlybayev, chief of health care department of Karaganda region.In his words, 6 people hospitalized with assumption of anthrax are in satisfactory condition. There condition does not call for any concerns. According to the doctors, a hospitalized 10-year-old child was a family member where the sick cow was butchered.The deceased man and woman were neighbours of the owner of the butchered cow. ""The woman might have been infected when she tried raw minced meat while cooking. She was in Karaganda on [18 Jun 2016], her relatives called the ambulance when she felt bad. She was taken to the regional hospital with an assumption of pancreatitis. On the next day, when the investigation of the source of the outbreak started, we revealed that this woman left for Karaganda. After that she was transferred to the infection hospital,"" said Nurlybayev.He said that the deceased people will be buried with performance of the special requirements in order to avoid spread of dangerous infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[With widespread use of antibiotic treatments it is very unlikely that any of the patients, alive or dead, have any viable bacteria in their bodies. So, while hygienic precautions are being invoked, the 2 corpses are in fact safe to handle. And this would be why the public health authorities had to depend on the veterinary diagnosis. This human propensity for antibiotics is why when investigating any suspect human case of anthrax, whatever the hospital laboratory may be doing, get out there, trace down any remains of the suspect source animal, and get samples into the veterinary diagnostic laboratory. This also has the advantage of giving an early lead as to where else the animal's meat might have been taken to be sold, and thus where other human cases may be waiting, and for the exposed people to be treated before they display symptoms.For maps of Kazakhstan, go to <http://www.ephotopix.com/image/asia/kazakhstan_political_map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53825>.
