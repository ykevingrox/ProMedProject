Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/volusia-and-orange-counties-each-report-2nd-vibrio-vulnificus-case-64822/>The number of _Vibrio vulnificus_ cases in Florida grew by 2 this week as both Volusia and Orange Counties reported the 2nd confirmed case each. This brings the state total to 18, including 4 deaths. Counties reporting cases include Brevard, Broward, Charlotte, Citrus, Collier, Duval (2), Manatee, Marion, Orange (2), Palm Beach, Santa Rosa, Sarasota (2), Volusia (2) and Wakulla counties. Fatalities have been reported from Broward, Citrus, Palm Beach and Santa Rosa counties._Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated, uncooked seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacterium. Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections can be a serious concern for people who have certain chronic diseases, particularly those with chronic liver disease. In these cases, the bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The recent data on _V. vulnificus_ in Florida is:2008: 16 cases, 6 deaths 2009: 24 cases, 7 deaths 2010: 32 cases, 10 deaths 2011: 35 cases, 13 deaths 2012: 26 cases, 9 deaths 2013: 41 cases, 12 deaths 2014: 32 cases, 7 deaths 2015: 45 cases, 14 deathsThere are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination); and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.]
