Manila Standard [edited]<http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-provinces/219893/12-die-in-mysterious-outbreak-.html>To date, 12 Mangyan natives have died from an unknown respiratory disease that swept across 2 highland villages in nearby Baco municipality [Oriental Mindoro province, Mimaropa region] over the weekend [22-23 Oct 2016], a tribal leader said.""Our brother Mangyans have already abandoned their homes and moved to safer grounds for fear that they may also be afflicted by the mysterious disease,"" said Alejandro Pablo, 67, an Alangan Mangyan tribal leader.Pablo said 12 natives, including 3 children, have died from the outbreak that started [Fri 21 Oct 2016].He also expressed fears that more Mangyans in those mountain villages would die as ""6 more sick mountain dwellers were showing same symptoms. I cannot give exact number of those sick and dying, but when I left Balangkawit and Kalamansian to seek immediate medical assistance from authorities, 12 had already died, including 3 Mangyan children,"" Pablo said.The 2 affected mountain sitios [rural enclaves, Balangkawit and Kalamansian] are located at the foothills of Mount Halcon that could be reached only by a whole-day hike.Marlon Roldan, chairman of a religious non-government organization called Hands of Love Philippines, said the sickness may be bronchopneumonia or diphtheria, which is a serious bacterial infection that affects the mucous membranes of the throat and nose. ""Coupled with diarrhea, these diseases can be fatal to both children and older people,"" he said.Roldan said a massive landslide in Baco in December last year [2015] caused by Typhoon ""Nona"" could have affected the source of fresh drinking water of the natives. ""Almost the entire mountain villages of barangays [Filipino term for a village, district, or ward] Bayanan and Mayabig in Baco were submerged in rocks, sands, and debris. These landslides and siltations may have compromised the source of drinking water for the Mangyan population,"" Roldan said.[Byline: Robert A Evora]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Baco is a municipality of over 37 000 residents in the province of Oriental Mindoro located in the east side of the island of Mindoro in the Philippines (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baco,_Oriental_Mindoro#/media/File:Ph_locator_oriental_mindoro_baco.png>).
