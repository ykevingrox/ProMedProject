Hoy.es, EFE agency report [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]<http://www.hoy.es/sociedad/salud/201610/21/seis-trabajadores-hospital-huelva-20161021115812-rc.html>At least 6 workers of the Juan Ramon Jimenez de Huelva hospital are affected by an outbreak of scabies, according to sources of the SATSE Nursing union. The first case was detected on Wednesday [19 Oct 2016] in a janitorial employee of the Nephrology department of this medical center and then 5 other cases have been diagnosed among nursing professionals.The SATSE union argues that the source of this outbreak could be a patient who had gone undiagnosed with the disease. After recording 6 cases, the hospital Prevention Service has sent a circular to workers with a series of tips to prevent the spread and people who already had symptoms have been treated.SATSE explained that scabies is a mild infectious disease that requires a non-aggressive treatment, because with the daily application of a cream and enough protection, symptoms improve or even disappear.Scabies is spread by indirect contact through sheets or clothing, or by direct contact, although in the case of health professionals the latter possibility is less likely because they work with gloves.The same sources have indicated that it is sometimes difficult to detect because this skin condition is often misdiagnosed as eczema or dermatitis, hence there may be more cases diagnosed in the coming days.SATSE considers it should be investigated whether the hospital ""has acted right or wrong"", for which they should determine the time that has passed since the first diagnosis to the time prevention and treatment were launched.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although rare, outbreaks in institutions are well known. Scabies occur worldwide from arctic to tropical areas and are a well known disease of poverty and poor hygiene.Scabies can be treated by ointments containing pyrethroids which are rubbed all over the body. Thorough washing of clothes and bed linen is vital to stop transmission.An alternative treatment is the use of 2 oral doses of Ivermectin, 200 microgram per kg body weight one week apart. Ivermectin has few side effects and can be given to both staff and patients. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6121>.]
