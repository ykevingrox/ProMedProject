She is the 5th victim this monsoon of the bacterial infection, which spreads due to walking in flood water contaminated with urine of infected animals.In the 1st week of August [2016], 101 patients with suspected leptospirosis were admitted to various civic officials. However, only 45 patients turned out to have leptospirosis after a confirmatory test, said a health report released by the BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] on [Tue 9 Aug 2016]. The report also showed that 245 people were admitted with suspected dengue, but only 19 showed positive for the viral fever.The girl's locality, the slum sprawl of Gautam Nagar [Mumbai, Maharashtra], was flooded several times in the last couple of months. She developed a high fever and started vomiting on [1 Aug 2016] and was rushed to Sion hospital where she passed away on [6 Aug 2016], said a health report sent by the BMC on [Tue 9 Aug 2016]. A senior BMC official said the patient suffered a known complication of a leptospirosis infection [called] acute respiratory distress syndrome.However, BMC officials said that the cases of leptospirosis are scattered across the city to suggest any outbreak of the infection like in 2015. Over 20 people died due to leptospirosis in 2015, most of them in July. Meanwhile, following the teenager's death, the BMC sent surveillance teams in the Gautam Nagar slum to look for other patients with leptospirosis symptoms. The press release said that 2400 houses were surveyed, with 9500 people checked for symptoms like fever. Around 25 people were found with fever and have been started on treatment.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/482>. Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of about 20.5 million (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai>). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra.Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide, and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall. Mumbai is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (June-September). July is the wettest month, with almost non-stop rain. At this time, parts of the city become waterlogged (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mumbai>) or flooded under several feet of water, as has been reported today (6 Jul 2015) in Mumbai (<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/Rain-lashes-city-water-logging-hits-city-traffic/articleshow/47964435.cms>).Leptospira are transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life.Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. After exposure to floodwater contaminated by leptospira-infected animal urine (usually rat -- see ProMED-mail: Leptospirosis - India: (MH) 20160706.4328586 and in India, cattle -- see ProMED-mail: Leptospirosis - India (02): (MH) bovine 20160727.4374009), the bacteria can enter the human body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. - Mod.ML]
