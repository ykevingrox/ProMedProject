We developed the following assessment items to get a better idea of the present situation as of 2015:1 - Assessment Area of Rural Anthrax in the province of Buenos Aires is made up of 30 districts in this province. There were random outbreaks of bovine anthrax in 4 of them (Alvear, Dolores, Laprida and Saladillo). All of them shared a common theme: ""the absence of vaccination"" despite its obligatory nature: re. Act Nå¡ 6703/1961 - Resolution Nå¡ 115/2014, province of Buenos Aires. The Annual Diagnostic Rate for  submitted samples was 7 per cent, 2 percentage points more than the previous term, 2014, though the overall average for 1977-2015 is 11 per cent.2 - Alert zone and response in the district of Azul. This district has a historical record of 67 outbreaks of bovine anthrax, a situation that has caused 19 human alerts and 20 veterinary alerts since 2004. No bovine outbreaks or human cases were noticed in the last 2 years. Simultaneous vaccination for foot and mouth disease and anthrax has been performed since 2004 and covered 1 498 008 bovines. There was a remarkable increase in vaccination of 72 per cent of cattle population (as of the mandatory nature of vaccination), as opposed to the historical 40 per cent in voluntary vaccination in previous years.3 - Isolations in other veterinary diagnosis laboratories. A new decrease of 5 percentage points compared to 2014 and 13 percentage points compared to 2013 were noticed in external monitoring laboratories s that contributed to this report. The annual diagnostic rate for submitted samples for anthrax in this period, 2015, was 5 per cent.4 - Districts of the province of Buenos Aires involved in anthrax outbreaks. There were 9 random outbreaks in 2015 in the districts of: Alvear (2) Rauch (3) and single outbreaks in: Dolores, Laprida and Saladillo-Punta Indio. All of them had a historical background of prior outbreaks.5 - Production of anti-anthrax vaccine for veterinary use. More than 27 million doses fuse with cattle were produced by 9 manufacturing laboratories. These laboratories produced 3 more million doses compared to 2014.6 - Simultaneous mandatory vaccination of bovines: 3 areas of anti-anthrax bovine vaccination were assessed as a follow-up of actions taken by the vaccination programs:- Alert and Response Zone (district of Azul -- province of Buenos Aires): 85 per cent of the cattle population was vaccinated in 2014, but only 68 per cent in 2015. This is 17 percentage points less of vaccinated bovines than the previous year.- Province of Buenos Aires: According to non official data, 83 per cent of the estimated cattle population was vaccinated in 2014 and only 63 per cent in 2015. Therefore, there were 20 percentage points less of vaccinated animals than the previous year.- Province of Santa FÌ©: 73 per cent of the exposed cattle population was vaccinated in 2014 and 86 per cent in 2015. This is 13 percentage points more than the previous year.7 - Cases of human anthrax nationwide. Nationwide, 5 cases of cutaneous [anthrax] were announced. 3 in the province of Buenos Aires and 1 case each in the province of Entre Rios and Tierra del Fuego, but the latter was not laboratory confirmed. [Tierra del Fuego is a recognized anthrax free province. - Mod.MHJ]8 - Other facts related to rural carbuncle. Different activities related to rural carbuncle are described in Argentina, showing a greater concern with this issue. [This covers dissertations and conference presentations by members of the Azul Laboratory. - Mod.MHJ]Conclusion: The negligence of cattle breeders in not vaccinating their stock and national and/or provincial bodies in not enforcing compliance adequately with the rules in full force and effect continues to maintain the endemic nature of this zoonosis in our country [Argentina]. The intervention of the active focal points by the competent authority, the effective disposal of carcasses, and the mandatory vaccination are the only means to control it. These are preventive and protective measures of legal rights: human health and cattle health determine production.--RamÌ n NosedaCo Director Laboratorio Azul54 02281 431770/71 - 15652891Azul, Buenos AiresArgentina<rnoseda@laboratorioazul.com.ar>[The complete report, submitted to WHO, is available at <http://www.laboratorioazul.com.ar/Carbunclo/carbunclo/carbunclo_rural_en_argentina_informe_2015.pdf> (in Spanish). Our thanks, yet again, to RamÌ n for this admirable and frank annual report on the status of livestock anthrax in Argentina.As we have seen time and again elsewhere in the world making vaccination compulsory and achieving 100 per cent participation are 2 separate states, as we all know. But the incidence is decreasing, and with success will come better rancher confidence and involvement. It is a matter of ongoing communication and awareness of personal responsibility. And this disease does not let lazy procrastinating ranchers hide. The control program will succeed and probably within the next 10 years. One of the benefits of successful anthrax control in livestock is that it simultaneously achieves eradication. And after a careful surveillance period of some 5-8 years without new cases, eradication can be claimed.Maps of Argentina can be found at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/argentina_pol96.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4>.
