Elancasti [in Spanish, trans Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.elancasti.com.ar/nacionales/2016/5/12/otra-muerte-hantavirus-pais-297773.html>A case [of a hantavirus infection] has caused a commotion in the Buenos Aires [province] city, Azul. A 12-year-old child died after becoming infected by [a] hantavirus in her school. As a result, the authorities of the institution decided to close the school in order to carry out disinfection tasks.The victim went to the Normal School and according to information provided by the head of the Department of Rural Zoonoses, Jorge Bolpe, the girl died from having contracted the disease. Also, they stated that another girl who attended the same school presented with symptoms similar to the 1st girl and was diagnosed with thrombocytopenic purpura, although the physicians in Mar del Plata who attended her stated that her [case] might, or might not, be related to the fatal case.3 mothers complained about the serious situation that exists in the educational facility currently. ""The school is full of rats and mice. Classes have had to be suspended for lack of good hygiene,"" they indicated in the complaint. ""This is the largest school in Azul and has some 2200 students in attendance. We are very afraid for what might occur to our children,"" stated the complaining mothers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There is no indication of the specific hantavirus involved in this case. If the school is infested with mice and rats, it is reasonable to assume that infected rodents were the source of the infection. There were 3 previous fatal cases of a hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province last year (2015). There were several cases of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province during 2014, 3 of which were fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The hantaviruses involved in the report above and in the previous cases are not identified, and ProMED-mail would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus has been laboratory identified.Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 4 years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these recent Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at <http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg>.Maps of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.argentina.org.au/images/mapa-politico-argentina.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2311>. - Mod.TY]******[2] USA (Colorado)Date: Wed 11 May 2016Source: Denver Post [edited]<http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29880087/another-san-luis-valley-resident-ill-hantavirus>Another Coloradan has tested positive for [a] hantavirus [infection] less than a month after a San Luis Valley resident died of the rare but often fatal disease spread by deer mice.A Rio Grande County resident who fell ill and was hospitalized was confirmed Wednesday [11 May 2016] to have the disease, according to county health authorities.Rio Grande County Public Health Director Emily Brown asked people to use caution when coming in contact with deer mice, their nests or droppings. Hantaviruses are not spread from person to person. People are infected by breathing in the virus when stirring up dust in barns, attics or woodpiles where deer mice nest.Deer mice have tawny backs, white bellies, big eyes and big ears. An estimated 10 to 15 percent of deer mice are infected with hantavirus [This varies from year to year and from place to place. - Mod.TY].Symptoms of hantavirus infections typically show up 1-6 weeks after exposure and may begin with fatigue, fever and muscle aches, as well as dizziness and nausea; 4-10 days later, a dry cough and breathing difficulties may develop as the lungs fill with fluid, followed by respiratory failure and possibly death.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in the western USA can be expected, so these 3 cases in Colorado are no surprise. A few cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have occurred in the western USA so far this year (2016). The hantavirus responsible for this case was not specified but undoubtedly is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in Colorado and the western USA. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as the 4 HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] deaths in Colorado last year (2015) and 3 New Mexico fatalities in 2014 indicate.The public needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important during spring and summer, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts. Previous posts this year (2016) indicate that increased precipitation due to El NiÌ±o climate effects may have an effect on mouse habitat, with increased exposure of humans in the region due to related increases in populations of Sin Nombre hantavirus-infected mice (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160116.3942572).A 20 Apr 2016 report of this same case provided additional helpful information about cleaning up rodent-infested areas. Open doors and windows and allow a room to air out for 30 minutes before going inside. Consider using a respirator mask (N-100 rating) that seals tightly to the face. DO NOT SWEEP OR DRY-VACUUM MOUSE DROPPINGS. Mix a fresh solution of one part bleach to 9 parts water (or 1.5 cups [355 ml] bleach per gallon [3.8 l] of water). Wear rubber gloves and spray droppings, nests, and carcasses with the bleach and water solution. Let soak for 5-10 minutes before cleaning up with a mop, sponge, or wet vacuum. After disinfecting, place mouse carcasses, nests and cleaning materials into a plastic bag. Tie the bag shut and put it in an outdoor trashcan. Wash hands and clothing after clean up (<http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29787096/colorado-resident-killed-by-hantavirus-disease-spread-by>).An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.A map showing the location of Colorado in the USA can be accessed at <http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/usstates/co.htm> and a map showing Colorado counties at <http://geology.com/state-map/colorado.shtml>. - Mod.TY]******[3] USA (Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona; Utah)Date: Wed 23 Mar 2016Source: US National Park Service [edited]<https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/cave-of-the-domes-closure.htm>Due to rodent activity and the potential exposure risk to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), the National Park Service has temporarily closed Cave of the Domes. Cave of the Domes, the only cave open to the public within Grand Canyon National Park, will remain closed until further notice. Coconino County [Arizona] has already had 2 cases of HPS this year [2016].Cave of the Domes, located near Horseshoe Mesa at the end of the Grandview Trail, is the only cave open to the public in Grand Canyon National Park. Old mines located near Horseshoe Mesa and throughout the park are also closed. With the exception of Cave of the Domes, permits are required to enter caves in Grand Canyon National Park due to the extremely sensitive nature of cultural and natural resources inside.To prevent HPS, public health officials recommend:- When camping or recreating outside, do not sleep or spend time in close proximity to rodent nests, burrows, or in areas of heavy rodent activity.- Do not make food or garbage easily available to rodents.- If rodent droppings or nests are found in and around the home or other buildings, do not stir the area up by vacuuming or sweeping. Spray the area liberally with a disinfectant (such as 1 part bleach to 8 parts water) and allow to soak for at least 15 minutes.- After disinfecting, wear rubber gloves and use disposable materials such as paper towels or rags to clean, and seal all materials in double plastic bags before disposal.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although this notice was issued 7 weeks ago, it has been posted because the summer vacation season in this area is rapidly approaching. The Grand Canyon National Park is an especially popular destination for domestic and international tourists. The park's precautions should be heeded. Precautions should be taken in wilderness areas or other places that harbor mice.An 8 May 2016 report indicates that access to the cave has been reopened as of 4 May 2016. This same report noted that the only public location identified as a potential source of exposure to the hantavirus in the southwest region of Utah is the Pine Valley Guard Station. It is located in the Pine Valley Recreation Area. The old building -- originally built to accommodate a recreation guard in the area seasonally, and later open for use by recreationists as a cabin -- is now marked off limits with a sign warning it is contaminated with [a] hantavirus (<http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2016/05/08/jek-how-deadly-hantavirus-infects-people-cases-in-utah-northern-arizona>).
