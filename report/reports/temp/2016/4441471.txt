The Myanmar Times [edited]<http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/yangon/22105-vaccine-program-aims-to-head-off-japanese-encephalitis-outbreak.html>Health officials are fighting back against a deadly outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, which has killed 19 people, including 4 children, since January [2016]. The Department of Public Health has launched a program to vaccinate 40 000 people in the hardest-hit locations. Because of the high price of the vaccine, the department is focusing on Rakhine and northern Shan states, where 4 children died within a month.Dr Aung Kyaw Moe, assistant director of the program, told The Myanmar Times yesterday [23 Aug 2016] that health workers would concentrate on 10 townships in the 2 states that had suffered the highest rate of fatalities.""We have vaccine only for 40 000 people, so we'll go 1st to northern Shan State, which has suffered the highest death rate, and then to Rakhine State in September or October. We've also asked UNICEF to help since end of 2014. We will be able to vaccinate more people when we get enough funds for more vaccine,"" he said. The disease is also found in Ayeyarwady, Yangon and Bago regions and Kayin and Mon states.In all, 173 people have been diagnosed with the disease. ""2 children died within 8 months in Yangon, but there are no other cases now in Yangon Region,"" said regional chief medical officer Dr Win Lwin.The vaccination costs K35 000 [approx. USD 29] for private patients at Yangon Hospital.Japanese encephalitis occurs mainly in rural parts of Asia. It is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and does not spread from person to person. Most infected people show no symptoms, but others might complain of a mild fever and headache, or suffer a more serious fever, neck stiffness, seizures and coma. About 1 in 4 victims dies, and survivors may be left with permanent disability. Unborn children are at particular risk.[Byline: Htike Nanda Win]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report gives a more comprehensive overview of the occurrence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Myanmar and efforts to control it there through vaccination than the previous report (see ProMED-mail archive no.20160824.4438953). The Myanmar surveillance system is providing case numbers in various localities. Focusing on vaccination, rather than attempts at vector mosquito control, will be more effective at preventing cases. One hopes that funding will be forthcoming to more adequately cover the populations in the states at risk.Maps of Myanmar can be accessed at <http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/myanmar_map2.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16205>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7855>. - Mod.TY]
