24 Horas [in Spanish, trans Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.24horas.cl/nacional/encuentran-en-chile-mosquito-que-transmite-virus-zika--1990220>The mosquito that transmits the Zika virus was found in Chile, specifically in the city of Arica, in the region of Arica and Parinacota.The finding was confirmed by the Minister of Health, Carmen Castillo, who explained that it is not clear how the mosquito arrived in the country and the number that exist in the area so far.""It could have been transported in a refrigerated vehicle from abroad; that could have brought the vector in one of them,"" said The Secretary of State. The health authority said that this ""is not fortuitous, but a finding from active searching.""Regarding the possibility that the vector could reach Santiago, The Health Minister clarified that environmental conditions are more optimal for the mosquito in the north of the country.Among preventive measures, Castillo called for calm, ""because right now no one is sick; it is the vector that transmits the disease that is present, and we will attack [it].""She also indicated that care networks will increase their attention to febrile illnesses and called on them to take the necessary practical measures urged by the Ministry of Health, such as covering items containing water or overturning to empty them.The mosquito [that was found] is female, so the possibility she has laid eggs in other parts of the country will be analyzed. Also the minister said that females can lay up to 200 eggs and that the insects can live up to a month.Finally, the minister clarified that the ISP [Public Health Institute] gave authorization to pharmacies to sell the repellent and that the Undersecretary of Assistance Networks, Jaime Burrows, will travel to the area.The Zika virus is transmitted to people through the bite of infected mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_, and especially _Aedes aegypti_ in tropical regions. It is the same that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever [viruses], reports the World Health Organization (WHO).--Communicated by:Flu Trackers<https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/south-america/south-america-guillain-barrÌ©-microcephaly-zika-virus-tracking/chile-ac/751943-mosquito-that-transmits-the-virus-zika-found-in-chile>******[2]Date: Sun 15 May 2016Source: ADN Radio [in Spanish, trans Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.adnradio.cl/noticias/nacional/confirman-hallazgo-de-larvas-de-aedes-aegypti-en-camarones/20160516/nota/3134795.aspx>Health SEREMI [regional ministerial unit] of Arica and Parinacota, Giovanna Calle, confirmed Monday [9 May 2016?] the discovery of a larva of _Aedes aegypti_ in the community of Camarones, on the banks of the river.This was explained by the official, adding that, to date, they have detected 12 places where the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has been found: 11 in Arica and one in Camarones.""28 days have passed since [the discovery of] the reintroduction of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in our region, which was eradicated in 1963. We had 12 foci after making a sweep of more than 3800 houses,"" she said.Calle added that ""we cannot give up, and we must continue to strengthen preventive measures to eliminate conditions that become potential mosquito breeding sites, such as water in containers without lids.""The head of the Zoonoses and Vector SEREMI of Arica and Parinacota, Manuel Gajardo, said vector scan also involved ""an inspection of the river bank, considering Taltape, Camerones, and a section down to the mouth of the river. We found no evidence elsewhere in villages.""--Communicated by:Flu Trackers<https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/south-america/south-america-guillain-barrÌ©-microcephaly-zika-virus-tracking/chile-ac/751943-mosquito-that-transmits-the-virus-zika-found-in-chile>[Gert van der Hoek, Senior Moderator for Flu Trackers (<http://flutrackers.com>) is thanked for bringing these reports to our attention.These 2 reports answer the 2 key questions raised by the previous report. 1st, the mosquito is, in fact, _Aedes aegypti_. Chile's proactive mosquito surveillance detected the mosquito very early, and follow-up action detected its presence in 11 additional places in the area. No doubt, surveillance will continue, and vector control measures will be implemented, along with continuing public education.2nd, both reports indicated that, as of the dates of their publication, no cases of Zika virus infection in the area had been reported nor occurrence of microcephaly or Guillain-Barre syndrome related to Zika virus infection.One hopes that the actions taken will successfully eliminate _Aedes aegypti_ in the area. However, given that Arica is a major hub for commerce and travel, this may not be the last time that this mosquito is introduced into the area. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>.]
