Classified as a primary case.2- A 38-year-old expat male from Baha, non-healthcare worker, reported as a fatality at the time of initial report. Classified as a primary case.Information on newly reported fatality:- A 38-year-old expat male from Baha, non-healthcare worker, no history of co-morbidities (see newly confirmed case no. 2 above)--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There are now 1429 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 598 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia since September 2012. The 2 newly confirmed cases reported today are both classified as primary cases. According to the MOH report, one of the cases had no known history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and the other one was under investigation. It was not clear which patient had which exposure history.Damman is the capital of the Eastern Region, also known as Ash SharqÇyah and is bordered by the Persian Gulf. Baha is located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia in the Al Bahah region just south of Makkah near the Red Sea (a map showing provinces can be found at <https://www.saudiembassy.net/about/country-information/map_of_provinces.aspx>).A map showing the locations can be found at the source URL.

The patient had been suffering from other chronic diseases at the time of his admission to the hospital.The 2 new cases were a 75-year-old Saudi man in Hofuf and an 84-year-old Saudi man in Alfalaj. The official said the patient in Alfalaj contracted the disease from a sick camel in the area. Medical reports said both the patients are out of danger and their conditions are stable. With the new incidences, the number of cases in the Kingdom [Saudi Arabia] since June 2012 has risen to 1404, which includes 597 deaths. A total of 16 patients are currently under treatment at various hospitals in the Kingdom.[Byline: Mohammed Rasooldeen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This media report contains information on a reported fatality from Tuesday, 28 Jun 2016, which I apparently missed including in the MERS-CoV update from that day.The involved individual was a 72-year-old Saudi male from Hail who had been reported as a newly confirmed case on 15 May 2016, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At that time he was classified as a primary case with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. The location of Hail can be found on the map of Saudi Arabia contained in the MOH report (<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-06-28-001.aspx>).My apologies for publishing an incomplete report that day. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Qatar, suspected MERS protocol - EpiCore Surveillance ProjectDate: 29-30 Jun 2016Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]In response to a request for information on the management of patients on whom specimens were sent to rule out a MERS-CoV infection in Qatar, we received the following information from EpiCore members:[a]With respect to the most recent case of MERS-CoV infection reported in Qatar, which was diagnosed 3 weeks ago, the patient was isolated upon presentation, even before the results of the test for MERS-CoV infection came back. Of note, this individual is now asymptomatic but was still MERS-CoV positive through 29 Jun 2016.[b]As per Qatar SCH [Supreme Council of Health] updated guidance, any suspected MERS-CoV case should be dealt with using standard and droplet precautions. If the receiving facility does not have the capacity for these precautions, the patient should be referred to the appropriate governmental designated health facility for isolation and sample collection.Any patient presenting with fever with or without flu-like symptoms should be inquired about recent travel to countries with ongoing MERS-CoV transmission and/or close contact with camels in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.With respect to the most recent case of MERS-CoV infection reported in Qatar, the patient had his initial assessment in a primary health clinic, from where he was isolated and transferred immediately to HMC [Hamad Medical Corporation] hospital.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Once again we would like to thank the EpiCore Surveillance Project members from Qatar for their rapid and very helpful replies to the request for information. The national guidelines with apparently good compliance clearly state, if MERS-CoV is on the differential diagnosis based on clinical and epidemiologic grounds, the patient should be isolated with respiratory precautions pending laboratory results, thereby reducing the likelihood of nosocomial transmission.It is interesting to learn that while the individual is now asymptomatic, he is still positive for active viral infection. It begs the need for further studies into the possible role of asymptomatic infections in the transmission of the MERS-CoV infection to possibly explain the sporadic ""primary"" infections that do not have a known high risk exposure -- neither contact with MERS-CoV infected camels or with known human cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Qatar can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/130>. - Mod.MPP]******[4] MERS-CoV pregnancy complicationsDate: Wed 29 Jun 2016Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/06/more-saudi-mers-noted-study-details-risks-pregnant-patients>Severe complications in pregnancy---------------------------------Meanwhile, a study published yesterday [28 Jun 2016] in Clinical Infectious Diseases described 5 cases of the disease in pregnant women, painting a grim picture of maternal and fetal outcomes.While hospital-acquired infections and contact with camels have been hallmarks of MERS transmission, little is known about how the disease affects pregnant women and fetuses, the authors noted.The study authors identified 5 pregnant MERS patients reported to the WHO from Saudi Arabia between November 2012 and February 2016, 2 of whom died. All 5 women were in their 2nd or 3rd trimester when they acquired MERS. One infection resulted in a stillbirth at 34 weeks gestation, and one infant died shortly after an emergency caesarian section at 24 weeks' gestation. One patient recovered from the disease and delivered a healthy baby at term.Two of the women were healthcare workers and were exposed to MERS by known cases of the disease. Two women had no known exposure risk, and one woman was an occupational contact of a patient. None of the women had any underlying health conditions. Three of the patients were from Riyadh, and the remaining 2 were from Mecca and Unayzah.All 5 women presented with symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Four of the 5 women were admitted to intensive care.The authors suggest that, like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or influenza A, infection with MERS-CoV while pregnant causes severe symptoms and illness in women. In pregnancy, both pulmonary function and immune system activity are compromised.""Efforts to limit exposure of pregnant women to MERS-CoV should be strengthened, and extended where possible,"" the authors said.[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The article referred to in the above report is: Assiri A, Abedi GR, Almasry M, Bin Saeed A, Gerber SI, Watson JT. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection during pregnancy: A report of 5 cases from Saudi Arabia. Clin Infect Dis. first published online 2016 Jun 28. doi:10.1093/cid/ciw412 (abstract available at: <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/28/cid.ciw412.abstract>). This is now the 4th report in the literature on the impact of MERS-CoV in pregnancy, further supporting the observation of the seriousness of such an infection during pregnancy both for the mother as well as the developing fetus. Prior reports included a case report from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia of a 3rd trimester infection (32 weeks) necessitating mechanical ventilation of the mother due to respiratory failure, with delivery of a healthy infant (see Ref. 1 below). In another report from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, there was a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection in a 3rd trimester pregnant female (also 32 weeks) with a history of visiting a farm that included camels 10 days preceding onset of symptoms. A healthy infant was delivered by C-section (see Ref. 2 below). Yet another report was from Jordan reporting on the 1st known outbreak of MERS-CoV in April 2012. There were 3 known pregnant women who were contacts of members of the initial outbreak in Zarqa, Jordan. Three female contacts were pregnant during the outbreak period, of whom 2 had mid-term miscarriages, but both women had negative serology for MERS-CoV infection. A 3rd woman was reported to have a stillbirth at approximately 5 months gestation, 7 days after the onset of symptoms consistent with an acute MERS-CoV infection (and had positive serology).1- Alserehi H, Wali G, Alshukairi A, Alraddadi B.
