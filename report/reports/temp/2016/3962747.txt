Daily Post [edited]<http://dailypost.ng/2016/01/24/patients-nurses-desert-fmc-asaba-as-lassa-fever-kills-two/>There was tension at Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba, Delta State, following the death of 2 Lassa fever patients within 4 days.The development had made many of the patients and nurses to flee the hospital.Punch reports that it took the efforts of the health workers at the FMC to remove the bodies of the 2 patients, who reportedly died of the disease.The State Health Commissioner, Dr Nicholas Azinge, who refused to react on the incident, said ""I know some persons have died; I cannot speak further on that because the Federal Ministry of Health is already doing something to sensitize the people and we in Delta State are also sensitising our people.""A doctor, who did not want his name in print, said ""we are afraid of the present situation, with over 22 persons already quarantined and so far 3 have died.""But in a swift reaction, the acting Medical Director of the Hospital, Dr Victor Osiatumeh said ""It is not as if nurses or patients have fled the hospital; the nurses and doctors are careful with protective measures to ensure they too are not infected; the situation, as a matter of fact, is precarious but we are managing it, especially the 22 persons quarantined.""[Byline: Ameh Comrade Godwin]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[These are the 1st Lassa fever cases that ProMED-mail has posted in Delta state since 2013. The situation described above is confusing. It is not clear from the report if 2 patients died or 3. Although the Medical Director of the hospital indicated that nurses have not fled, if they have indeed left the hospital and a physician is afraid of the situation, this suggests that there is a serious problem with facilities and adequate training of health care workers.Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of person protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety. However, the Medical Director of the hospital stated that protective measures are employed, but did not indicate what those measures are.The circumstances under which these patients acquired their Lassa fever virus infection are not stated, but presumably occurred outside of the hospital.Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians.Images of mastomys mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5476>. - Mod.TY]
