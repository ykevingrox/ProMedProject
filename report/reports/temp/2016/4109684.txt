Shanghai Daily [edited]<http://www.shanghaidaily.com/national/Beijing-reports-another-imported-yellow-fever-case/shdaily.shtml>The Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning on Monday [21 Mar 2016] announced one more imported yellow fever case, making a total of 4 in the capital. The patient, a 50 year old man from south east China's Fujian Province, began running a fever in Angola on 6 Mar [2016] and had sought treatment in several local hospitals. He had not been vaccinated before going to Angola and informed the Beijing Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau of his arrival on 18 Mar [2016]. He tested positive for yellow fever at Beijing Capital International Airport and was sent to hospital. His condition was described as ""serious"".Beijing had reported 3 imported yellow fever cases since 13 Mar [2016], all returnees from Angola.Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly found in tropical regions of Africa and Central and South America. Symptoms include fever, jaundice, and bleeding.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This brings the number of yellow fever (YF) cases imported into China from the Angola outbreak to 5 nationally, of which 4 are in Beijing, and again raises the question about how many more of the Chinese workers in Angola are unvaccinated and at risk of YF virus infections. If the Angola YF outbreak continues, the risk of introduction of the virus by viremic unvaccinated workers into southern China, where dengue virus transmission occurs, will increase during the warmer mosquito vector season, which is rapidly approaching. Mosquitoes that transmit dengue viruses can also transmit yellow fever virus. Chinese health authorities are wise to maintain surveillance of incoming travelers from Angola to detect, isolate, and treat febrile individuals and to make contingency plans in order to be ready to respond quickly should YF viremic individuals come to the dengue-endemic provinces of China: Hainan, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang Yunnan and Guangdong, and initiate an outbreak.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.A HealthMap of China can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Mod.TY]
