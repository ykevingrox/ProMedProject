New York Times [edited]<http://goo.gl/5mEqOp>The 1st yellow fever outbreak in Angola in decades has killed 178 people, the World Health Organization said on Thursday [24 Mar 2016]. WHO said that more than 450 people had been infected by the disease since December [2015]. Its statement said that, while 5.7 million people had been vaccinated against yellow fever, there is a global vaccine shortage.Yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the same species that spreads the Zika virus.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is curious that the 15 Mar 2016 post citing a WHO report indicated that there were at least 250 yellow fever (YF) deaths since the end of December 2015, but the above report indicates that there are 178 YF fatalities. There is no apparent reason for the discrepancy. Although the above report indicates that 5.7 million people have been vaccinated, presumably mainly in the Luanda area, the global vaccine shortage apparently is not affecting the vaccination campaign there.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY]
