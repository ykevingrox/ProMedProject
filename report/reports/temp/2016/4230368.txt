CDC Outbreak Reports [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/small-turtles-10-15/index.html>CDC collaborated with public health, veterinary, agriculture, and wildlife officials in many states, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Veterinary Medicine to investigate 4 separate multistate outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections. Results from these investigations indicated that contact with small turtles or their environment were the likely source of these outbreaks.Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) can be a source of human _Salmonella_ infections. Reptiles can carry _Salmonella_ germs and still appear healthy and clean. _Salmonella_ germs are shed in reptile feces (droppings) and can easily contaminate their bodies and anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles that live in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread to people. Turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches are a well-known source of human _Salmonella_ infections, especially among young children. Because of this risk, the FDA banned the sale and distribution of these turtles in 1975.Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC, is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.Investigation of the Outbreaks------------------------------In 4 separate multistate outbreaks, a total of 133 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ were reported from 26 states between 16 Jan 2015 and 8 Apr 2016. In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals during the week before becoming ill; 55 (50 percent) of the 110 people interviewed reported contact with small turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, before their illness. 25 (45 percent) of the 55 ill people who had contact with small turtles reported purchasing the turtle from a street vendor or receiving the turtle as a gift. One ill person received a small turtle purchased at a flea market vendor who obtained the turtles from Tangi Turtle Farm in Louisiana.On 28 Apr 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) posted on their Disease Outbreak News to inform the international health community about the CDC outbreak investigation. Because small turtles raised in the USA are exported to other countries, WHO indicated that there is a risk to people, especially to young children, in other countries.The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a U.S. public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is a partnership among the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and state and local health departments.The NARMS human surveillance program at CDC monitors antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ and other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories. CDC's NARMS laboratory conducted antibiotic resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from 15 people infected with one of the 4 outbreak strains. One isolate was resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline; the other 14 isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested.Summaries for each of the 4 separate multistate outbreak investigations are provided below.Outbreak 1: _Salmonella_ Sandiego Investigation-----------------------------------------------17 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Sandiego were reported from 9 states. The number of ill people identified in each state was as follows: California (6), Florida (1), Illinois (3), Mississippi (1), Oklahoma (1), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (1), Texas (2), and Vermont (1).In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals in the week before they became ill. Of the 13 ill people who were interviewed, 8 (62 percent) reported contact with small turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, in the week before they became ill.Among people who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 16 Jan 2015 and 22 Nov 2015. Ill people ranged in age from younger than 1 year to 77 years, with a median age of 8. 65 percent of ill people were female. Among the 15 ill people with available information, 5 (33 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.Outbreak 2: _Salmonella_ Poona and _Salmonella_ IIIb 61:i:z53 Investigation---------------------------------------------------------------------------70 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Poona and _Salmonella_ IIIb 61:i:z53 were reported from 21 states.

Of the 59 ill people who were interviewed, 33 (56 percent) reported contact with small turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, in the week before they became ill.Among the people who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 7 Apr 2015 and 8 Apr 2016. Ill people ranged in age from younger than 1 year to 96 years, with a median age of 6. 43 percent of ill people were female. Among the 59 ill people with available information, 21 (36 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.Several states collected samples from turtles and their environments at ill persons' homes and isolated the outbreak strains of _S._ Poona.Outbreak 3: _Salmonella_ Sandiego Investigation-----------------------------------------------21 people infected with a different outbreak strain of _S._ Sandiego were reported from 7 states. The number of ill people identified in each state was as follows: Arizona (2), California (9), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (4), Oregon (2), Texas (2), and Washington (1).In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals in the week before they became ill.

Ill people ranged in age from younger than 1 year to 65 years, with a median age of 19. 57 percent of ill people were female. Among the 18 ill people with available information, 5 (28 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.Oregon public health officials collected samples from turtles and their environment at ill persons' homes, and the Oregon State Laboratory isolated the outbreak strain of _S._ Sandiego.Outbreak 4: _Salmonella_ Poona Investigation--------------------------------------------25 people infected with a different outbreak strain of _S._ Poona were reported from 6 states. The number of ill people identified in each state was as follows: Arizona (2), California (10), Nevada (2), New York City (1), Ohio (1), and Texas (9).In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals in the week before they became ill. Of the 20 ill people who were interviewed, 7 (35 percent) reported contact with small turtles or their environments, such as water from a turtle habitat, in the week before they became ill.Among the people who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 11 Feb 2015 and 14 Nov 2015. Ill people ranged in age from younger than 1 year to 78 years, with a median age of 4. 54 percent of ill people were female. Among the 22 ill people with available information, 7 (32 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.Local health officials in California collected samples from the turtle environment at an ill person's home, and isolated the outbreak strain of _S._ Poona.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED previously posted the WHO report mentioned in this CDC post (Salmonellosis - USA (07): pet turtles 20160428.4190298). In November 2015, CDC's previous report (Salmonellosis, multiple serotypes - USA: pet turtles 20151109.3779058), it was reported that 51 people had been infected with either _S._ Poona or _S._ Sandiego.Regarding _Salmonella_ IIIb 61:i:z53, the nomenclature for salmonellae (Brenner FW, Villar RG, Angulo FJ, Tauxe R, Swaminathan: Salmonella nomenclature. J Clin Microbiol 2000;38:2465-2467) summarizes the current system used by CDC:According to the CDC system, the genus _Salmonella_ contains 2 species, each of which contains multiple serotypes. The 2 species are _S. enterica_, the type species, and _S. bongori_, which was formerly subspecies V. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies, which are referred to by a Roman numeral and a name (I, _S. enterica subsp. enterica_; II, _S. enterica subsp. salamae_; IIIa, _S. enterica subsp. arizonae_; IIIb, _S. enterica subsp. diarizonae_; IV, _S. enterica subsp. houtenae_; and VI, _S. enterica subsp. indica_). _S. enterica_ subspecies are differentiated biochemically and by genomic relatedness.Serotypes---------CDC uses names for serotypes in subspecies I (for example, serotypes Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Typhi, and Choleraesuis) and uses antigenic formulas for unnamed serotypes described after 1966 in subspecies II, IV, and VI and in _S. bongori_. The name usually refers to the geographic location where the serotype was 1st isolated. For named serotypes, to emphasize that they are not separate species, the serotype name is not italicized and the 1st letter is capitalized. At the 1st citation of a serotype the genus name is given followed by the word ""serotype"" or the abbreviation ""ser."" and then the serotype name (for example, _Salmonella_ serotype or ser. Typhimurium). Subsequently, the name may be written with the genus followed directly by the serotype name (for example, _Salmonella_ Typhimurium or S. Typhimurium) (18, 19). CDC uses the format for formula designations used by the WHO Collaborating Centre. Both versions of the serotype name are listed as key words in manuscripts to facilitate the search and retrieval of information on Salmonella serotypes from electronic databases. Serotype names designated by antigenic formulae include the following: (i) subspecies designation (subspecies I through VI), (ii) O (somatic) antigens followed by a colon, (iii) H (flagellar) antigens (phase 1) followed by a colon, and (iv) H antigens (phase 2, if present) (for example, _Salmonella_ serotype IV 45:g,z51:-. For formulae of serotypes in _S. bongori_, V is still used for uniformity (for example, S. V 61:z35:-).Before 1966 all serotypes in all subspecies except subspecies IIIa and IIIb were given names. In 1966 the WHO Collaborating Centre began naming serotypes only in subspecies I and dropped all existing serotype names in subspecies II, IV, and VI and _S. bongori_.The majority (59 percent) of the 2463 _Salmonella_ serotypes belong to _S. enterica_ subsp. I (_S. enterica subsp. enterica_). Within _ S. enterica_ subsp. I, the most common O-antigen serogroups are A, B, C1, C2, D and E. Strains in these serogroups cause approximately 99 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in humans and warm-blooded animals. Serotypes in _S. enterica_ subspecies II (_S. enterica subsp. salamae_), IIIa (_S. enterica subsp. arizonae_), IIIb (_S. enterica subsp. diarizonae_), IV (_S. enterica subsp. houtenae_), IV (_S. enterica subsp. indica_), and _S. bongori_ are usually isolated from cold-blooded animals and the environment but rarely from humans. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
