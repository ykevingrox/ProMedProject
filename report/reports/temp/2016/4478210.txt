The 2nd dose should be administered a minimum of 28 days after the 1st dose.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The previous post on mumps in Arkansas indicated those afflicted include both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. - Mod.LK]******[2] USA (Arkansas) spreadDate: Thu 8 Sep 2016Source: Greenwich Time, AP (Associated Press) report [edited]<http://www.greenwichtime.com/news/education/article/Northwest-Arkansas-mumps-outbreak-spreads-into-9211309.php>Northwest Arkansas mumps outbreak spreads into Rogers-----------------------------------------------------An outbreak of mumps in northwest Arkansas has spread into Rogers [in Benton County, northwest Arkansas].Rogers School District spokeswoman Ashley Siwiec told reporters Thursday [8 Sep 2016] that at least 2 students likely had mumps.Arkansas Health Department epidemiologist Dr. Dirk Haselow said there are 76 confirmed or suspected cases of the virus that was 1st found in late August [2016] in Springdale schools [in Washington and Benton counties, northwest Arkansas].The outbreak is the state's largest since 2010 when 5 cases were confirmed. It's centered in northwest Arkansas, where the Health Department says the opt-out rate for vaccinations exceeds any other area of the state. State law allows parents to claim medical, religious or philosophical exemptions from school vaccination requirements.Mumps is a viral infection that causes swelling in the salivary glands and cheeks and may include headaches, fatigue, muscle aches and low-grade fevers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Mumps virus is an enveloped single-stranded, linear negative-sense RNA virus of the Rubulavirus genus and Paramyxovirus family. Initial signs and symptoms often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after 7 to 10 days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About 1/3rd of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include infections of the covering of the brain (15 percent), pancreatitis (4 percent), permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling which uncommonly results in infertility.Mumps can be prevented with MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. Two doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective.See Mumps - USA (17): (AR) 20160902.4459649 for further discussion of mumps outbreak in Arkansas.A map of the USA showing the location of Arkansas can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208>. - Mod.LK]
