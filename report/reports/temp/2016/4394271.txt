The Moscow Times [edited]<https://themoscowtimes.com/news/kazakhstan-bans-russian-imports-due-to-anthrax-outbreak-54857>Kazahkstan has suspended livestock and animal origin product imports from Russia amid an outbreak of anthrax and nodular dermatitis in the country, the republic's Agriculture Ministry said in a statement Thu 4 Aug [2016].An anthrax outbreak hit the Yamal-Nenets autonomous district in northern Russia last week for the 1st in 75 years. The outbreak was reportedly caused by the thawing of an infected frozen reindeer corpse due to unusually high temperatures.The first [human] fatality was a 12-year-old boy who reportedly died in a hospital after eating infected venison. As of 2 Aug [2016], a total of 90 people are under observation in hospital and 20 cases have been confirmed. Quarantine was imposed in the infected areas of the region on 25 Jul [2016].On 4 Aug [2016], it was reported that the Russian Defense Ministry had sent the Orlan aerosol disinfection system to the region in order to fight the outbreak, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. The Orlan system can disinfect up to 90 square meters [approx. 969 sq. feet] of surface per minute. In total, 200 servicemen and 30 vehicles have been sent to the region to deal with the outbreak.The nodular dermatitis viral disease, which spreads among cattle, is currently registered in several Russian regions including Astrakhan, Krasnodar and Stavropol, and the republics of Kalmykia, Ingushetia and Dagestan, according to RIA Novosti.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 4 Aug 2016Source: The Interpreter [edited]<http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-update-august-4-2016/>The Russian Defense Ministry has sent a team, armed with the latest system for aerosol disinfection, to Yamal where people and animals are stricken with Siberian anthrax, Novaya Gazeta reports.Yaroslav Roshchupkin, an aide to the commander of the Central Military District described how the military was combating the outbreak, TASS reported: ""A military transport plane has deployed in Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region the latest Orlan system for aerosol disinfectant from Yeakterinburg to Salekhard, from where it will travel on its own to the Siberian anthrax area to perform the assignment.""The Orlan is a modular system, adopted in 2015, mounted on the chassis of a KamAZ-53501. It can deploy up to 8 self-powered treatment sites with a capacity of 50 units of equipment per house and up to 90 square meters [approx. 969 sq. feet] of surface per minute. The system is outfitted with an operable crane and hydraulic lifts.""Personal safety suits and structures are also being supplied.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[After the Sverdlovsk incident in 1979 the Soviets sprayed all the buildings in the affected zones with disinfectant. Logically this new spraying device is a continuation of that principle. The KamAZ-53501 is a heavy duty military truck; see a scaled model at : <http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/dxf-kamaz-53501-truck-cargo-kamaz/693065>.  The KamAZ-53501 was designed as an army truck in 1995 and stays as one of the most wide spread cargo truck on a Kamaz chassis in the Russian Army. It has a capacity of 6 tons. With this truck to carry their sprayer they mean business.According to the International Epizootic Bureau, nodular dermatitis is expanding its area of circulation in the direction of the north, which is of great concern for the veterinary services of Russia. Scientists note that the disease begins with fever up to 40 deg C [approx. 104 deg F] and above. Then there are watery discharge from the eyes, lethargy, loss of appetite, salivation, constrained gait and progressive emaciation. Studies show that the mortality rate of infected cattle ranges from 4 to 95 percent.For the 1st time the disease was registered in Central Africa in 1929. At the moment it is found in 19 countries in Africa. It is new for Turkey, Iran, and Azerbaijan. - Mod.MHJKazakhstan's ban on imports of cattle from the Russian federation to prevent the introduction of Nodular Dermatitis (Lumpy skin disease, LSD) is somewhat belated. LSD is already present within the western provinces of Kazakhstan, 1st reported to the OIE on 22 Jul 2016 (see 20160722.4363497), probably introduced from the infected, neighboring Russian regions of Astrakhan or Volgograd. The disease may have entered Kazakhstan earlier, namely in June 2016, and seems to be continuing its spread (see 20160727.4374008). - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/428>.]
