La Nazione [in Italian, trans. & abridged by Submitter. edited]<http://www.lanazione.it/grosseto/cronaca/meningite-cracovia-punta-ala-1.2400097>According to the Italian newspaper ""La Nazione,"" the Italian girl died of meningitis [on Mon 1 Aug 2016 in Vienna, Austria], while returning home from World Youth Day [WYD] in Poland [Krakow, 26-31 Jul 2016], already reported in ProMED-mail (<http://www.promedmail.org/post/4390751>); she stayed in the PuntAla Camping Resort, Grosseto, Tuscany Region, Italy from 9-23 Jul 2016 before leaving for Krakow, Poland [on 24 Jul 2016].According to the newspaper ""La Nazione,"" local Italian health authorities recommend anti-meningococcal chemoprophylaxis for people who stayed at the PuntAla Camping Resort from 21-23 Jul 2016.In 2015 and 2016, increased incidence of invasive meningococcal disease of serogroup C/clonal complex 11 was reported in Tuscany, Italy (<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21423>).--Communicated by:Individual who requested confidentiality[ProMED-mail has previously reported on the meningococcal C, molecular type C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST-11(clonal complex 11), outbreak in Tuscany, Italy; see ProMED-mail posts below.The following is a summary of the CDC recommendations for chemoprophylaxis of invasive meningococcal diseases (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5407.pdf>): Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease. Close contacts include 1) household members, 2) child-care center contacts, and 3) anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions (e.g., through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, or endotracheal tube management). The attack rate for household contacts exposed to patients who have sporadic meningococcal disease has been estimated to be 500-800 times greater than the rate for the total population. Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest immediately after onset of disease in the index patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally less than 24 hours after identification of the index patient). Chemoprophylaxis administered to close contacts more than 14 days after onset of illness in the index patient is probably of limited or no value.Both tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) and tetravalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) are recommended for use in control of meningococcal outbreaks caused by vaccine preventable serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y of _Neisseria meningitidis_. An outbreak is defined by the occurrence of at least three confirmed or probable primary cases of meningococcal disease in less than 3 months, with a resulting primary attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5407.pdf>). For calculation of this threshold, population-based rates are used rather than age-specific attack rates. Serogroup B vaccines have been similarly used in the face of meningococcal serogroup B outbreaks.We have not been told as yet the meningococcal serogroup of the isolate causing the infection in the 19-year-old pilgrim who died, nor whether vaccination of the exposed population is planned. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/113>.]
