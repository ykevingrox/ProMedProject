It was only today in the morning that around 20 pupils came to me in the office complaining of headaches and stomachaches,"" the head-teacher of Ong'adi Primary School said in a KTN report.The affected students were from different primary schools, with 22 cases being reported from Ong'adi Primary, 15 from Ngira Primary School, and 2 from Rae Primary School.Most of the affected pupils were girls.The teachers and parents suspected that the medication given to the pupils had expired.County medical officer Dr Lucy Ojwang however said that some of the pupils who suffered could have taken the medicine on an empty stomach, but that they were investigating the cause of the reaction.[Byline: Matilda Nzioki]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The treatment administered most probably was mebendazole. Mebendazole have very few side effects and even if expired, would not be expected to induce adverse reactions. In persons with heavy infections with _Ascaris lumbricoides_ (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris>) subileus [partial blockage] or even manifest ileus [full blockage] can been seen due to obstruction of many dead worms. Whether this is the explanation of the symptoms reported here is not known, but if the children with abdominal symptoms passed large numbers of _Ascaris_ this would explain the symptoms following treatment (McCORT JJ: Ascaris ileus in children. Radiology. 1958;70:528-31). - Mod.EPMaps of Kenya can be seen at <http://softkenya.com/county/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2015/05/Counties-in-Kenya.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/853>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ].................................................sb/ep/mj/dk"
