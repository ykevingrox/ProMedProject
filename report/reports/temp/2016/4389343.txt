It is not clear who was responsible.Both sides in Syria's civil war have been accused of, and denied, using chemical agents.On Monday [1 Aug 2016], a Russian military helicopter was shot down near Saraqeb. Dr Abdel Aziz Bareeh, who works in Saraqeb, told the BBC that 2 barrels of chlorine gas were dropped on the town late on Monday. [It is not clear whether it was by the same helicopter that was shot down. - Mod.TG].""We know it's chlorine, because we were hit by it in the past, and we are familiar with its odour and symptoms. We have 28 confirmed cases, mostly women and children.""Separately, a spokesman for Syria Civil Defence told Reuters that 33 people had been affected in the attack. The organisation of volunteer rescue workers said it suspected the barrels contained chlorine but were unable to confirm it [Apparently, according to other sources, it has been confirmed as chlorine. - Mod.TG].Chlorine is a common industrial chemical, but its use in weapons is banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention [It appears the perpetrator of this crime is either unaware of the forbidden nature of the weapon or has total disregard for the Chemical Weapons Convention ruling. - Mod.TG].Symptoms typical of chlorine poisoning include sore eyes, irritated skin, breathing difficulties and bloody foaming from the mouth.Meanwhile clashes are continuing near Aleppo, where rebels have launched an offensive to break a government siege.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: 2 Aug 2016Source: CNN [edited]<http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/02/middleeast/syria-aleppo/index.html>In the Saraqeb attack, the gas, which the statement said smelled like chlorine, caused 30 cases of breathing difficulties, the Idlib Civil Defence -- also known as the White Helmets -- said. CNN has spoken with a doctor in Saraqeb who said he treated some of those affected by the attack, who said their symptoms were consistent with those ""of someone who has suffered from chlorine poisoning.""A photographer who took photos of the injured for the White Helmets told CNN that victims were suffering symptoms such as watering eyes, spasms, sweating, coughing and difficulty breathing.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[""How chlorine works:- The extent of poisoning caused by chlorine depends on the amount of chlorine a person is exposed to, how the person was exposed, and the length of time of the exposure. - When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throat, and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage these tissues. Immediate signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure- During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop: - Blurred vision - Burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine - Burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes - Coughing- Chest tightness- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled. - Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours [This may be what was referred to in the articles as ""bloody foaming from the mouth."" - Mod.TG]- Nausea and vomiting - Watery eyes - WheezingWhat the long-term health effects are- Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.""Portions of this comment have been extracted from: <http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/chlorine/basics/facts.asp>. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>.]
