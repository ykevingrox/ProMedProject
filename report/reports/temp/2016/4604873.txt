News [edited]<http://bit.ly/2e5qdNo>West Australians (WA) are being warned about an increased risk of measles after a 2nd person within a week was diagnosed with the illness upon their return from overseas.The person visited many places throughout Perth's southern and eastern suburbs, and was infectious from 21 to 28 Oct [2016]. WA Health director of communicable diseases Paul Armstrong said staff had been contacting potentially exposed people directly where possible, but it was impossible to identify and specifically warn people in public places.Measles is a highly contagious viral illness spread when infected people cough and sneeze, and is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of a rash. ""Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune,"" Dr Armstrong said.A person is immune if they have previously received 2 doses of a vaccine or were born before 1966.Dr Armstrong said anyone who developed a fever with other symptoms including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash within 3 weeks of potential exposure to measles should stay home and consult a doctor, but should call ahead and mention their possible contact before visiting a GP or emergency department.[Specific locations where people could have been exposed to measles are listed in the URL above. - Mod.LK]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.]
