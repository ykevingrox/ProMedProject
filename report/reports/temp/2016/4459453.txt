CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/08/us-first-e-coli-resistant-both-colistin-carbapenems>US researchers say they've identified a strain of _Escherichia coli_ that is resistant to both colistin and carbapenem antibiotics in a United States hospital patient [1].According to a study published today [30 Aug 2016] in the journal mBio, the strain was isolated from the urine of a 76 year old male patient who was being treated for a urinary tract infection at a New Jersey hospital in 2014. Whole-genome sequencing of the isolate, performed this year [2016], confirmed the presence of the _mcr-1_ and _bla_NDM-5 genes, which confer resistance to colistin and carbapenems, respectively. The strain was found to harbor resistance genes to several other antibiotics, as well.The finding confirms fears that were aroused when researchers in China 1st identified the colistin-resistance gene _mcr_-1 in _E. coli isolates from pigs, pork products, and humans in November 2015. Colistin is considered an antibiotic of last resort in humans, used mainly when bacterial infections won't respond to other drugs.To date, more than 30 countries -- including the United States -- have reported finding bacteria containing the gene in samples from humans, animals, and the environment.Because _mcr_-1 is carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids that can easily be shared with other types of bacteria, public health officials have warned of the possibility of the gene hooking up with Gram negative bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics -- like carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- and creating ""superbugs"" that are nearly impossible to treat.While other countries have reported _E. coli_ strains harboring both _mcr_-1 and _bla_NDM-5, the authors of the study say this appears to be the 1st case to be reported in the US. In this case, the patient's urinary tract infection did respond to other antimicrobial agents. But the authors warn that other _E. coli_ strains carrying the 2 resistance genes, which are carried on separate plasmids, are likely out in the community.""The good news is that this did not cause a major outbreak of drug-resistant infection,"" senior study author Barry N Kreiswirth, PhD, founding director of the Tuberculosis Center at Rutgers University's Public Health Research Institute, said in a news release from the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), which publishes mBio. ""The bad news is that since this occurred 2 years ago, there are clearly other strains out there we haven't detected yet.""Study co-author Jose R Mediavilla, MBS, MPH, said the _E. coli_ strain identified in the patient was a variant of ST405, which has been frequently identified with community-onset urinary tract infections. Kreiswirth and Mediavilla said the finding indicates the need for active surveillance for bacteria that carry both genes in order to prevent further dissemination._mcr_-1-harboring _E. coli_ has been previously reported in the US. In May [2016], investigators with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research reported finding the gene in a strain obtained from a Pennsylvania woman this year [2016]. In a study published in July 2016, researchers identified the gene in an _E. coli_ isolate obtained from a New York hospital in 2015.Reference:1. Mediavilla JR, Patrawallab A, Chena L, et al.

Available at: <http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/4/e01191-16.full>.[byline: Chris Dall]--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall[Clinically, both the carbapenems and colistin are ""antibiotics of last resort"", -- that is, used in situations in which the patient is seriously infected with an organism resistant to all antimicrobial drugs, except for these few drugs._mcr-1_ is a plasmid-encoded gene that determines resistance to colistin, reports of which ProMED-mail has previously posted (see below). The presence of _mcr-1_ in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has also been reported before, but not from the US. The above is the 1st report of an _E. coli_ strain harboring both colistin (_mcr-1_) and carbapenem (_bla_NDM-5) resistance genes, originally isolated in August 2014 in New Jersey from urine of a patient with recurrent urinary tract infections. The patient had emigrated from India and resided continuously in the United States for one year prior to his hospitalization. This _E. coli_ isolate was resistant to colistin and all beta-lactams (including carbapenems) except aztreonam, but remained susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, tigecycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Multilocus sequence typing showed that this strain was ST405, a sequence type that has been frequently associated with community-onset urinary tract infections. Dissemination of _mcr-1_ within this global lineage may, therefore, contribute to further spread of colistin resistance. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/232>.]
