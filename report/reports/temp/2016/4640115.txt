Notifications of HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhea all increased in the territory between 2006 and 2015.A particularly sharp increase was recorded for gonorrhea, rising from 8.1 instances per 100 000 people in 2006 to 32.6 per 100 000 by 2015. Syphilis notifications went up from 4.2 per 100 000 in 2006 to 11.8 per 100 000 in 2015.The ACT was among 3 jurisdictions to record the highest rate of newly-acquired HIV infection in 2015, with 20 new cases. The authors of the HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report 2016 urged caution, however, warning figures were low and trends should be interpreted with caution.Among those newly infected with HIV who had been having heterosexual sex, 42.9 percent of men and 50 percent of women recorded a late diagnosis. 18 percent of men having sex with men received a late diagnosis. AIDS Action Council of the ACT executive director Philippa Moss said an increase in testing explained the spike in figures. ""It is concerning but we have to look at the bigger picture and testing is part of the bigger picture,"" she said.""Stigma and discrimination has a lot to do with this because if you're able to talk about things it's easier to get tested but if you suffer from stigma about the practice you're doing and having HIV you're more inclined to take risks. ""We've certainly been investing a lot of time and resources into promoting testing, whereas people can often go undiagnosed.""In the same report, it was shown hepatitis C and B were on the decrease in the ACT.[Byline: Emily Baker]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[For discussions on the effect of increased screening for syphilis, gonococcal disease, and HIV on the increased incidence of these diseases, please see my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts: Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (CA), 2015 CDC national report 20161027.4589422; Syphilis - USA (10): MSM, increase syphilis screening 20160925.4514369; and Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/290>.]
