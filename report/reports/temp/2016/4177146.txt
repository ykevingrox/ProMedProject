Hundreds of people are at risk of catching measles after a person infected with the disease attended the Tainui Waka Kapa Haka Festival in Hamilton on Sat [16 Apr 2016].The Waikato District Health Board has now been notified of 5 cases of measles in the Waikato.There were 17 haka groups competing from the Tainui waka region event, held at the Claudelands Event Centre, with about 5000 people attending the festival. These groups came from areas spanning from Coromandel down to South Waikato including Waikato, Hauraki, Maniapoto and Raukawa.The 5 cases detected by the DHB all attended the Waikato Hospital Emergency Department on Fri 25 Mar; Mon 4 Apr; Sat 9 Apr; Sun 17 Apr and Tue 19 Apr 2016. Two were admitted to hospital. One person attended Nga Taiatea Wharekura while infectious.Medical officer of health Dr Felicity Dumble said it was a timely reminder for everyone to check that they and their children were fully immunised against measles. She said anyone who attended the festival or the hospital's emergency department on the dates listed might have been exposed to measles. People who shared the same air as someone infected with measles, even just being in the same room, are at risk of developing the disease if they are not immunised.""These are the same measures we had to put in place during the outbreaks of 2014 and 2015. We learnt very early that we had to be strict with the quarantine and, by being strict, it will prevent further cases at the school,"" Dumble said. ""Vaccination affords full immunity in the vast majority of cases."" In 2014, there were 124 cases of measles in Hamilton associated with an outbreak.Dumble has advised people to look for symptoms of measles for 14 days after the event (until 30 Apr 2016). The 1st symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, sore runny eyes and cough. The rash starts later. She said people should check their immunisation status for measles. If people do not have immunity, they should be vaccinated as soon as possible with the MMR vaccine. ""If you or your family do have the above symptoms, phone your GP for advice.""People could also call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice or seek medical attention depending on the severity of illness. It is important to call first, because measles is highly infectious, and people with measles could infect others around them, for example in waiting rooms of GP surgeries or hospital emergency departments.Measles is spread by tiny droplets in the air and is one of the few diseases that could spread easily to those nearby.[byline: Donna-Lee Biddle]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report updates the New Zealand measles situation posted by ProMED-mail on 16 Apr 2016 (Measles update (09): New Zealand (WK), South Sudan, Pakistan (SD) 20160416.4164196).

She was found to have developed impaired speech and movement, involuntary bodily jerks and falls and lack of bladder control over a 9 month neurological decline leading up to the seizure.The woman, who moved to Australia from The Philippines 2 years earlier, was diagnosed with probable subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by infection associated with measles.""This case is important as it highlights a terrible consequence of a vaccine-preventable disease,"" the study's authors said, pointing to the number of measles cases in Australia rising from 154 in 2013 to 335 the following year.A measles vaccination rate of 92 per cent for 5 year olds in 2012 fell short of a desired 99 per cent rate to prevent transmission of the disease, the authors said.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Before the 23 year old's diagnosis, an MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging) of her brain ""showed cerebral volume loss and extensive white matter changes,"" according to an MJA statement. ""She had a strong positive result for measles antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which, combined with clinical features of progressive mental deterioration, led to a diagnosis of probable subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)."" <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3545081/Fit-healthy-student-23-dying-rare-complication-MEASLES-causing-fall-wet-constantly.html>.Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus. SSPE has been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare disease in developed countries, with fewer than 10 cases per year reported in the United States. The incidence of SSPE declined by at least 90 per cent in countries that have practised widespread immunization with measles vaccine. The incidence of SSPE is still high in developing countries such as India and eastern Europe. There is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female: 3/1). Most youngsters with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. Despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset of SSPE, researchers think that the infection of the brain occurs soon after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly. Why it persists and progresses still isn't clear. The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Some people may become blind. In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. There is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system.Excerpted from: <http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/subacute_panencephalitis/subacute_panencephalitis.htm>. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186>.]
