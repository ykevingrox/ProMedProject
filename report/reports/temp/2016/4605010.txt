Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/new-hampshire-invasive-group-a-strep-cluster-linked-to-heroin-use-32067/>The New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services (NH DPHS) issued a health alert after learning of 4 cases of invasive group A streptococcal bacteremia, all males, and all active injection heroin users from Southern/Central New Hampshire, who presented to healthcare in the last 10 days [22 Oct to 1 Nov 2016].Health officials say it is unclear if these cases are connected; however, injection drug use is a risk factor for invasive bacterial infections, including group A streptococcus [GAS]. The investigation is ongoing. Beth Daly, Chief of the Bureau of Infectious Disease at DPHS says law enforcement has been informed of the investigation.The most common disease caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ [GAS] is pharyngitis, or strep [sore] throat. Strep throat is very common in school-aged children, particularly in the winter and spring months. Untreated strep throat can lead to more serious complications like rheumatic fever; however, this is relatively uncommon.It is also a cause of several skin infections such as impetigo and cellulitis. Impetigo is a characterized by a crusty lesion frequently found on the mouth area. Cellulitis typically occurs after a wound or burn where the bacteria enters and spread though the skin and lower tissues.More serious, potentially life-threatening infections caused by _S. pyogenes_ include necrotizing fasciitis (commonly called flesh-eating bacteria) and toxic shock syndrome. In addition, _Streptococcus pyogenes_ can cause scarlet fever, septicemia and pneumonia. The death of Muppets creator Jim Henson was a result of an infection with _S. pyogenes_.Penicillin is still the drug of choice for treating _S. pyogenes_ infections. In cases when a person is penicillin allergic, erythromycin is an alternative treatment.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[During the late 1990s and early 2000's, an increase in infections due to _Streptococcus pyogenes_, also referred to a Group A streptococci (GAS), in injection drug users (IDUs) was observed in Europe and the U.S. (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19040471>, <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9279330>, and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8250663>). IDUs presented with a variety of clinical manifestations, including severe soft tissue infection at the drug injection site, bacteremia, endocarditis, and disseminated infection (e.g., pneumonia and septic arthritis). A history of shared paraphernalia for drug use and common drug dealers were often noted. Some outbreaks were noted to be due to the same strain of GAS (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2640854/>, <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16721256>).The above news report does not say what the clinical manifestations were in the infected IDUs other than bacteremia, if they shared drug paraphernalia or if they used a common drug source, and if genotyping was done on the clinical isolates of GAS. More information in the regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States, bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. The state's population centers (e.g., Manchester, Nashua, Concord, and Portsmouth) are concentrated in southern and central regions, where the outbreak of GAS infection in IDUs is said to be occurring.
