Global Post / Xinhua [edited]<http://www.globalpost.com/article/6717505/2016/01/10/mozambique-sees-more-malaria-cases-2015> Mozambique sees more malaria cases in 2015------------Mozambique's northwestern province of Tete is the most-hit region by malaria across the country, with 213 people died of the disease in 2015, rising substantially from the 22 deaths recorded in 2014, local media reported on Sunday.According to the state-owned news agency AIM, a total of 370 000 malaria patients sought medical units for medical care in 2015 in Tete, which reportedly hosts large coal reserves.In 2014, 20 000 cases of the disease were reported across the province, of which 22 resulted in deaths, according to the diagnosis made by health authorities in Tete province.The upward trend in the number of people who died of malaria, as well as disease cases seen in 2015, was due to the late arrival of patients to health facilities scattered around the Tete province, according to the head of Community Health, Regina Nassiaca. ""On our evaluation, we noted that in 2015 we had more deaths of malaria than in 2014, because the patients went to health units too late. And this worried us too much,"" said Nassiaca.Nassiaca said health authorities had been spreading messages to educate people to rush to health units as soon as they learn that they suspect of having malaria. ""Last year [2101], the Tete health units distributed around 910 000 mosquito nets to the people to protect from the disease. It is a significant number for  people who need the treated nets in the communities,"" Nassiaca said.The country's Health Ministry says that malaria continues to be the main  killer disease in the former Portuguese colony apart from the AIDS pandemic.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Malaria is endemic in the northern part of Mozambiqe including the Tete province. A map of the transmission intensity can be found in the 2015 WHO World Malaria Report (page 139) (<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/report/en/>).From the same report it appears that overall finding for malaria control decreased from 2012 and 2013 to 2014, the latest year data are available. From the same graph it appears that malaria control was funded with approximately 110 million USD in 2013 but only approximately 75 million USD in 2014. The decrease was entirely due to lack of funding from the Mozambique government, whereas international donors maintained their support for the national malaria control program. Thus the increase in malaria cases reported here could very well be due to reduced investment in the malaria control program in 2014 if continued into 2015. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/33050>.]
