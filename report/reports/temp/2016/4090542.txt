Influenza type A viruses are prevailing over type B but, unlike the situation in the 2014-15 season, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are prevailing over A(H3N2), and the proportion of B/Victoria-lineage detections has risen substantially, representing about 92 percent of those ascribed to a B virus lineage. To date, 23 EU/EEA countries have shared 424 influenza-positive specimens with the Francis Crick Institute, London, for detailed characterisation: 16 additional countries and 330 specimens since the December 2015 report. Since the latter report, 230 viruses have been characterised antigenically and genetic analyses are ongoing. The 166 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterised antigenically were similar to the vaccine virus A/California/7/2009. Worldwide new genetic sub-clusters of viruses within the 6B clade have emerged, with 2 being designated as subclades: 6B.1 defined by HA1 amino acid substitutions S162N and I216T and 6B.2 defined by HA1 amino acid substitutions V152T and V173I. Of the 123 viruses characterised genetically, 18 (14%) were clade 6B, 98 (80%) were subclade 6B.1 and seven (6%) were subclade 6B.2. The 26 A(H3N2) test viruses characterised by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay were poorly recognised by reference antiserum raised against egg-propagated A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, the vaccine virus recommended for use in the 2015-2016 northern hemisphere influenza season, despite over 75% of the test viruses falling in the same genetic subclade (3C.3a) as the vaccine virus. The test viruses were recognised somewhat better by antisera raised against egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, the virus recommended for use in 2016 southern hemisphere and 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines. Of 40 A(H3N2) viruses characterised genetically: one (2%) was clade 3C.3, 23 (58 percent) were subclade 3C.2a and 16 (40 percent) were subclade 3C.3a. The 33 B/Victoria-lineage viruses were antigenically similar to B/Brisbane/60/2008 and fell in genetic clade 1A as do recently collected viruses worldwide. The five B/Yamagata viruses characterised fell in genetic clade 3 and reacted well with post-infection ferret antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013, the recommended vaccine virus for the northern hemisphere 2015-16 influenza season and for use in quadrivalent vaccines in the 2016 southern hemisphere and 2016-17 northern hemisphere influenza seasons.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The full document is available as a pdf at the url above.It appears that the composition of the vaccine is on target for the influenza H1N1 and H3N2 transmission seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. - Mod.LK]******[2] WHO influenza updateDate: Mon 7 Mar 2016Source: WHO, Influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza Update number 258, based on data up to 21 February, 2016------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------In the Northern Hemisphere high levels of influenza activity continued with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating and an increase in the proportion of influenza B viruses detected. In the Southern Hemisphere and in tropical countries influenza activity was generally low.In Europe ongoing high levels of influenza activity continued to be reported, although in some countries activity seemed to have peaked already. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounted for most virus detections with an increase in the proportion of influenza B detections. In Russian Federation and Ukraine, elevated SARI activity continued but at lower levels compared to previous weeks.In North America, influenza activity increased further with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating in Canada and United States of America and A(H3N2) in Mexico.In Northern/Temperate Asia, influenza activity remained high but seemed to have peaked already in some countries.In Western Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease. Oman reported ongoing low levels of both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses.In Africa influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was reported in northern Africa.In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America and the Caribbean, influenza and other respiratory virus activity were overall at low levels, except Jamaica, and Puerto Rico with high but decreasing influenza activity.In South East Asia, ongoing low influenza activity was reported during this period.In the temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere influenza activity remained low at inter-seasonal level.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 98 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 08 February 2016 to 21 February 2016* (data as of 2016-03-04 07:20:12 UTC).The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 158 158 specimens during that time period. 42 727 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 33 745 (79 percent) were typed as influenza A and 8982 (21%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 19 269 (87.7 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2709 (12.3 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 589 (24.4 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 1821 (75.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing percentage of respiratory specimens that tested positive by influenza transmission zone as of 3 March 2016 is shown at URL above.
