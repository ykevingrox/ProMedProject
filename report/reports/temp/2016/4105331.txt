Business Standard, Indo Asian News Service (IANS) report [edited]<http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/goa-records-seventh-monkey-disease-death-116031100996_1.html>Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) also known as ""monkey disease"" has claimed its 7th victim in the remote sub-district of Sattari.Speaking to reporters, state epidemiologist Utkarsh Betodkar said the 66-year-old woman was the 7th person to succumb to the KFD disease, which is caused due to proximity of human beings to wild monkeys.""The woman from Sattari died in hospital. She had been suffering from fever and loose motions and was identified as KFD-positive,"" Betodkar said.KFD was first identified in 1957 from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka.Since the time of its discovery, around 400-500 people across western India have been infected by the rare disease which spreads through ticks, a parasite for which monkeys are common hosts.Over the last 2 years, more than 130 people have tested positive for KFD, almost all of them in Sattari, which is located within the lower reaches of the Western Ghat mountain range in north eastern Goa.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) cases occurred in Goa in 2015 and are continuing now with 7 cases, into 2016. The situation where she acquired her infection is not stated.As noted in the previous posts, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case fatality rate is 3-5 per cent (see the CDC fact sheet at <http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html>).Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although monitoring ticks for KFD virus provides information for issuing alerts, the only means for prevention of infection is avoidance of tick bites.Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf>).Maps of India showing the location of Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala, the states where KFD virus is endemic and cases have been occurring over the last year, can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/states/> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/51973>. - Mod.TY]
