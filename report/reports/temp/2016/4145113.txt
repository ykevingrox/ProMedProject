The disease is curable if treated in early stages.[Byline: Happiness Tesha]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a map of Tanzania, go to: <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/tanzania_pol_2003.jpg>. Kilimanjaro is in the middle of the north-east border of Tanzania with Kenya. For a description of Rombo district, go to: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rombo_District>This report has no information on laboratory confirmation, so it must be ""suspect"" for the moment.Cutaneous anthrax is more than a ""rash"", it is a black ulcer. But it is curable if treated promptly with antibiotics. And the incubation period depends on the effective dose, the bigger the dose, the shorter the incubation period. As exposure to a carcass, either directly during butchering or from meat, it tends to be short, sometimes merely hours. The disease is sporadic in Tanzania but regularly spills out of the national parks where it can be persistent. - Mod MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34109>.]
