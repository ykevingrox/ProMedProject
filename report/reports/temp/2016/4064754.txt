WHO Ebola situation reports [edited]<http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-2-march-2016>Worldwide, there have been 28 639 [reported confirmed, probable & suspected] cases of Ebola virus disease and 11 316 [reported confirmed, probable & suspected] deaths at 14 Feb 2016 in 10 countries.***Total confirmed cases (by week, up to 28 Feb 2016) 15 217, data not available for confirmed deaths.[The previous WHO situation update was up to 17 Feb 2016 - see ProMED-mail Ebola update (18): WHO, susp., research, funding, NGO 20160228.4055480]SummarySierra Leone------------Human-to-human transmission directly linked to the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa was declared to have ended in Sierra Leone on [7 Nov 2015]. The country then entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance to ensure the rapid detection of any further cases that might arise as a result of a missed transmission chain, reintroduction from an animal reservoir, or re-emergence of virus that had persisted in a survivor. On [14 Jan 2016], 68 days into the 90-day surveillance period, a new confirmed case of EVD was reported after a post-mortem swab collected from a deceased 22-year-old woman tested positive for Ebola virus. On [20 Jan 2016], the aunt of the index case developed symptoms and tested positive for Ebola virus. No further cases were reported, and the aunt was discharged from treatment on [4 Feb 2016] after providing a 2nd consecutive negative blood sample (RT-PCR) and was discharged. All contacts linked to the 2 cases had completed follow-up by [11 Feb 2016]. If no further cases are detected, transmission linked to this cluster of cases will be declared to have ended on [17 Mar 2016].Liberia-------Human-to-human transmission linked to the most recent cluster of cases in Liberia was declared to have ended on 14 January 2016. Guinea------Guinea was declared free of Ebola transmission on [29 Dec 2015], and is approximately halfway through a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance that is due to end on [27 Mar 2016].With guidance from WHO and other partners, ministries of health in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have plans to deliver a package of essential services to safeguard the health of the estimated more than 10 000 survivors of EVD, and enable those individuals to take any necessary precautions to prevent infection of their close contacts. Over 300 male survivors in Liberia have accessed semen screening and counselling services. In addition, over 2600 survivors in Sierra Leone have accessed a general health assessment and eye exam.To achieve the second key phase 3 response framework objective of managing residual Ebola risks, WHO has supported the implementation of enhanced surveillance systems in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to enable health workers and members of the public to report any case of febrile illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD. In the week to [28 Feb 2016], 1474 alerts were reported in Guinea from all of the country's 34 prefectures. The vast majority of alerts (1467) were reports of community deaths. Over the same period, 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 392 new and repeat samples (14 samples from live patients and 378 from community deaths) from 20 of the country's 34 prefectures. In Liberia, 1062 alerts were reported from all of the country's 15 counties, most of which (925) were related to live patients. The country's 5 operational laboratories tested 815 new and repeat samples (657 from live patients and 158 from community deaths) for Ebola virus over the same period. In Sierra Leone 1865 alerts were reported from the country's 14 districts. The majority of alerts (1479) were for community deaths. 1114 new and repeat samples (34 from live patients and 1080 from community deaths) were tested for Ebola virus by the country's 7 operational laboratories over the same period. The overall trend in 2016 is one of an increase in the number of alerts reported, suggesting a continuing improvement in disease surveillance capacity throughout the three countries. The number of new samples tested has remained stable week on week, but with an average of 330 samples tested per week Guinea tests around one-third the volume of samples as do Liberia and Sierra Leone. However, the geographical distribution of sampling is improving, with an increased number of prefectures submitting samples for testing.

Studies into virus persistence in breast milk are ongoing and more evidence is needed to understand the risk of transmission and duration of the virus. The revised guidance recommends that if Ebola virus is detected in breast milk, lactating survivors should suspend breastfeeding and use a safe breast milk substitute until they obtain 2 consecutive negative Ebola tests.[Read the updated guidance on clinical care of Ebola survivors at the source URL above.][Refs:Assessment of the risk of Ebola virus transmission from bodily fluids and fomites.Bausch DG1, Towner JS, Dowell SF, Kaducu F, Lukwiya M, Sanchez A, Nichol ST, Ksiazek TG, Rollin PE.J Infect Dis. 2007 Nov 15;196 Suppl 2:S142-7Mothers with probable, confirmed Ebola should not breast-feedAWHONN.

Following these trips, we developed several starter applications for organizations working in Ebola response and recovery. We are excited to add a new starter app for contact tracing efforts. This template app is based on several applications we built during the Ebola crisis.The ""Contact Tracing 2.0 Application"" is featured on the CommCare Exchange, and can be freely downloaded and adapted by any organization that wants to deploy contact tracers in the field. It includes registration and tracking of Ebola patients, and follow-up with the households and contacts that are being monitored daily for symptoms. The application triggers alerts if an individual becomes a suspected case, making it widely deployable to investigation teams who need to quickly identify and follow up with contacts.Key Features of the application:Tracing of Ebola patients, households of contacts, and individual contacts attached to their respective parent cases- Daily monitoring forms for visiting contacts- Alerts for when contacts have a high temperature or show symptoms- GPS map view of cases on phone to find cases easily- Images for symptom questions to help users engageThis is one of several Ebola starter applications available, the others include:Infection, Prevention, Control (IPC) - available on the exchange here- Supply Chain Management for IPC - contact supply@dimagi.com if interested in deploying- Ebola Education, Training, and Stigma Reduction - available on the exchange here- Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) Decommissioning - available on the exchange hereThese features build off of lessons learned from Dimagi's 2 large-scale contact tracing deployments in West Africa.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******* 1 Mar 2016: Liberia decommissions Ebola treatment unit<http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-decommissions-ebola-treatment-unit.html>[The Government of Liberia and its health partners have decommissioned the Kakata Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU).

The longest amount of time for a survivor to carry the virus in their blood was 29 days. - Most survivors transitioned from actively having the illness to convalescence at around day 16 or 17. - 70 per cent of semen samples from male survivors tested positive for the virus in the first 7 months after illness (in data available before mid-2015). - Apart from blood and semen, most other body fluids pose a low infectious risk.There was too little evidence to allow a strong conclusion on breastmilk.[Reference----------Brainard J, Pond K, Hooper L, Edmunds K, Hunter P: Presence and persistence of Ebola or Marburg Virus in patients and survivors: a rapid systematic Review.
