For a map of Bajaur Agency, go to:<http://bit.ly/2bKGW3i>.This seems to be a classic instance of humans infected as a result of butchering an animal dying with anthrax. A blood sample from the child that died should reveal _B. anthracis_, as a bacteremia occurs with systemic anthrax. But with cutaneous lesions, bacteremias are not expected unless the infection is edging into a systemic one. The best way to test a cutaneous lesion is to insert a needle under the lesion and draw out any fluid there. My Russian friend Benyamin Cherkassky, with a lot of experience with this disease there, said that, with luck, 30% would reveal the vegetative pathogen. An anthrax cutaneous lesion is typically inflamed, maybe with small vesicles, and which itches but is not painful. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14067>.]
