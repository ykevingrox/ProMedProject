Both showed 'very similar symptoms', although it has yet to be confirmed whether they caught botulism from eating dried roach.All supermarkets and delicatessens in the towns of DÌ©nia, Altea, La Nucia, Torrevieja, Benidorm, Orihuela and Alicante city have taken it off the shelves, as have those in the province of CastellÌ n, Gandia (Valencia province) and Valencia city. In Catalunya, shops in Barcelona, Badalona and Sabadell (Barcelona province), Salou (Tarragona province) and Lleida have withdrawn it from sale.The Spanish Consumer, Food Safety and Nutrition Agency (AECOSAN), part of the ministry of health, says it has received a European alert after a case of botulism in Germany thought to have been caused by the same product.--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[Many of the botulism risks related to salted, cured fish are a result of the fish not being adequately eviscerated. The viscera of the fish are the parts most likely to be contaminated. Although not stated, most cases of botulism associated with the aquatic environment are serotype E whereas most other cases in humans are either type A or B. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/27808>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101>.][See Also:Botulism - USA (08): vacuum packed fish, risk, recall 20160623.4302950Botulism - USA (06): (NY,CA) dried salted uneviscerated fish, risk, recall 20160426.4184418Botulism - USA: (MN) uneviscerated fish, recall 20160115.39352852015 ----Botulism - Ukraine: dried fish 20150607.3417187Botulism - USA (04): (NY) uneviscerated fish, risk, recall 20150421.3312199Botulism - USA (02): smoked fish ex Greece, risk, recall 20150215.3168432Botulism - USA: uneviscerated fish, risk, recall 20150129.31300002014 ----Botulism - USA (10): dried fish, risk, recall 20140920.2790079Botulism - UK: smoked fish, risk, recall 20140912.2767758Botulism - USA (07): (AK) fatality, fermented fish 20140819.2703023Botulism - Canada (03): smoked fish, risk, recall 20140604.2518390Botulism - USA (02): (TX) salted fish, risk, recall 20140408.23897782013----Botulism - USA (02): (CA) smoked fish, risk, recall 20130411.1638640Botulism - Canada (02) : (ON, QC) gefilte fish 20130331.1611463].................................................ll/je/dk"
