Since 1 Sep 2016 there have been 8 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported, 6 with a history of either direct or indirect exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. All 8 of these cases were classified as primary cases, meaning no identifiable contact with other laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection.In the WHO updates there is mention that an investigation of camels associated with these sporadic cases is ongoing by the Ministry of Agriculture. It would be interesting to see reports of findings of these investigations to learn more of the proposed transmission cycle from camels to humans.Maps showing the locations of the specific cases mentioned in the above report can be found at the source URLs.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
