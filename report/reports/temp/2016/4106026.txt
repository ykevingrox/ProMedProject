Robert Koch Institut [In German, machine trans., edited]<http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/L/Lassa/Lassavirus-Infektion.html>Lassa virus infection has not been confirmed in 2 contacts of the patient who died of the disease at the end of February 2016 at the Cologne University Hospital [North Rhine-Westphalia state]. The deceased man worked for a humanitarian organization in Togo and was infected there.Blood tests of a contact person carried out on 15 Mar 2016 confirmed the diagnosis of Lassa infection. The appropriate precaution measures were taken immediately and the patient was placed in isolation at the Frankfurt University Hospital [Hesse state].The 2nd and 3rd cases, who were in isolation and under observation in Dusseldorf [North Rhine-Westphalia state], had had contact with the body of the deceased patient between late February and early March 2016. Because they showed incipient symptoms, blood tests were carried out on 17 Mar 2016 and initial results revealed a diagnosis of Lassa virus infection. These findings have now been withdrawn because they could not be confirmed, as notified by the Dusseldorf University Hospital on 19 Mar 2016 (<http://www.uniklinik-duesseldorf.de> [in German]).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It appears as though there were false positive initial tests on the 2 additional contact cases reported yesterday (18 Mar 2016) as repeat testing did not confirm Lassa virus infection. To date there is only one Lassa virus positive contact of the index case confirmed (see Lassa fever - West Africa (14): Germany (RP) local transmission, mortician 20160316.4098169 for details).The rapid isolation of the suspected cases following initial positive laboratory tests was highly appropriate, as was the transparency in reporting on the unfolding events. According to other reports, all known contacts of the original fatal case are in voluntary home isolation for 21 days from their last contact with the patient.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Germany can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/101>. - Mod.MPP]
