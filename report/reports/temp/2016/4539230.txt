Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/india-reports-first-ciguatera-poisoning-outbreak-more-than-100-affected-42568/>For the 1st time on the Indian subcontinent, an outbreak of ciguatera was reported in Mangaluru [or Mangalore, Karnataka], where more than 100 people were sickened [1 Oct 2106] after consuming fish heads.Biologists in India warn that the risk of additional outbreaks stems from a number of factors such as climate change, ocean acidification resulting in coral reef deterioration, and nutrient run-off resulting in toxic algal blooms.More than 400 species of fish, including barracuda, black grouper, blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog snapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, king mackerel, and yellowfin grouper have been implicated in this foodborne illness that's relatively common in several areas of the world, to the tune of 50 000 cases annually.This toxin is the result of the accumulation of marine algae and the toxins they produce passing up the food chain. These marine algae hang on to dead coral and seaweed. They are then eaten by herbivore fish, which are subsequently eaten by predatory reef fish, which concentrates the toxin in its tissue. People get this foodborne toxin from eating these contaminated larger fish. The reef fishes are more likely to get contaminated during storms and other turbulence.After eating the affected fish (the fish does not get sick from the toxin and actually tastes good), in as little as a couple of hours, symptoms may appear. Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting tend to appear early. Then, a feeling of weakness and hypertension may occur in addition to complaints of intense itching.Some mild to severe neurological symptoms are common with ciguatera; dizziness, impaired coordination, blurred vision, and even coma may be seen in severe cases.An unusual characteristic that is common in ciguatera is temperature reversal. This may be seen from 2 to 5 days after eating the fish. Hot objects seem cold, and cold objects can give a shock-like sensation. There have been serious injuries because a person was unable to recognize extremely hot sensations. Other odd symptoms are that food may taste metallic, and teeth may seem painful or loose.The gastrointestinal symptoms usually resolve in a couple days; however neurological symptoms may last for months or years. Symptoms may come back after ingesting certain foods and drinks; alcohol, caffeine, nuts, and fish.There are no laboratory tests to diagnose this disease, and it's based on clinical symptoms and a history of eating an offending fish. Some studies have shown that IV mannitol is effective in providing relief and recovery if taken within the 1st 72 hours of intoxication. Other than that, most treatment is for the various symptoms the person may have. Prevention can be difficult since the toxin in the fish cannot be killed by cooking, and there is no offensive odor or appearance to the fish.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:PRO/MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[According to the newswire above, no laboratory test results have been provided, and the food poisoning is based on clinical symptoms and a history of eating contaminated fish.Ciguatera fish poisoning is an illness caused by eating fish that contain toxins produced by marine microalgae called _Gambierdiscus toxicus_. People who have ciguatera poisoning may experience nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms such as tingling fingers or toes. Ciguatera has no cure. Symptoms usually go away in days or weeks but can last for years (<https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ciguatera>).Ciguatera toxin tends to accumulate in large predator fish weighing over 2 kg (4.4 lbs.), such as the barracuda and other carnivorous reef fish, because they eat other fish that consume toxin-producing algae, which live in coral reef waters. The toxin has highest concentrations in fish visceral and sex organs.The toxin may be found concentrated in large reef fish, most commonly barracuda, grouper, red snapper, eel, amberjack, sea bass, and Spanish mackerel. These fish live in coral reef waters and accumulate the toxin when they eat smaller reef fish which feed on the dinoflagellates.Ciguatera toxin is harmless to fish, but poisonous to humans.Ciguatera is increasingly attracting greater public attention and discussion among the general public and within the community of food safety experts.The following is taken from CDC: Cluster of ciguatera fish poisoning -- North Carolina, 2007. MMWR 2009; 58(11): 283-5 (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5811a3.htm>; edited; original citation numbering retained):""Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the most potent sodium channel toxins known (3). Carnivorous tropical and semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on plant-eating fish that have ingested _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ or another member of the _Gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters (4). Gambiertoxins from _Gambierdiscus_ spp. are converted into more potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. Spoilage of fish that have been caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not deactivate the toxin. Humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). The attack rate can be as high as 80 to 90 per cent in persons who eat affected fish, depending on the amount of toxin in the fish.""Persistence or recurrence of neurologic symptoms are hallmarks of CFP [ciguatera fish poisoning]. Three of the 9 patients in this cluster had recurrences of one or more symptoms for more than 6 months after their initial illness. If these patients are again exposed to fish (either ciguatoxin-contaminated or even non-contaminated fish), their symptoms likely will be more severe than those experienced with their initial episodes of CFP (3).""Variations in the geographic distribution of the various ciguatoxins might explain regional differences in symptom patterns. CFP symptoms associated with eating fish from the Pacific Ocean are primarily neurologic, and symptoms associated with eating fish from the Caribbean Sea are more commonly gastrointestinal (4). Amberjack often is linked to CFP cases in the Caribbean. Although the amberjack fish responsible for this cluster of CFP cases tested positive for C-CTX-1, it was not tested for the presence of other ciguatoxins, which also might have been present and could have altered disease presentation (7).""CFP has been associated almost exclusively with eating fish caught in tropical or semitropical waters, but increased global marketing of these species has increased the possibility that persons in temperate zones might become ill with CFP (4). Moreover, warming seawaters might expand the ranges of ciguatoxin-contaminated fish (8). In the USA, such fish have been found as far north as the coastal waters of North Carolina. Despite underreporting, CFP now is considered one of the most common illnesses related to fish consumption in the USA (9).""Any level of ciguatoxin 0.1 ppb [parts per billion] or more of fish tissue is thought to pose a health risk (3). As this illness becomes more common in nontropical areas of the world, clinicians need to be aware of its manifestations and how to manage it. Although opinions vary on the most effective course of treatment, intravenous mannitol has been a mainstay of management of neurologic symptoms for more than 20 years. Early mannitol treatment is considered more effective, but anecdotal evidence suggests that even delayed therapy benefits some patients. Amitriptyline also has been useful in relieving some of the neurologic symptoms of CFP (10). If evaluating a possible case, clinicians should consult their local poison control center for the latest treatment guidelines.References----------3. Pearn J: Neurology of ciguatera.
