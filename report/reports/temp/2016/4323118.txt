The residents are said to have consumed meat from 10 infected cow carcasses between 17 and 20 Jun [2016], only for them to develop symptoms for cutaneous anthrax less than 10 days later.Nursing officer in charge at Lenginet Level Two Hospital Khalid Kibet said the 1st cases were reported on Monday morning [27 Jun 2016] when a young man brought himself for check up with wounds on his earlobes and hands.""Cutaneous anthrax usually affects the skin which usually present itself as a raised, itchy bump resembling an insect bite that quickly develops into a painless sore with a black centre,"" Mr Khalid said. While urging the residents to ensure that they only feed on inspected meat, Mr Kibet urged them to seek medical help if they develop the symptoms.According to the area residents, some of the meat from the carcasses was ferried to several areas in Nakuru including Salgaa, Kimango, Lenginet center and Nakuru town.""I came home with the meat on Saturday, 18 Jun [2016] and I took it with my family. On Sunday (a week later) [26 Jun 2016], I developed some itchy sores on my face and on Wednesday [29 Jun 2016] the situation grew worse and I visited the health centre,"" said a 17-year-old victim.Ministry of Health officer at Rongai sub-County Stephen Belio said they had already begun a sensitisation exercise on precaution measures to ensure no lives are lost.--Communicated by:Sabine ZentisCastleview English LonghornsGut LaachD-52385 NideggenGermany<http://www.cvlonghorns.de><cvlonghorns@aol.com>[To find Rongai, and Nakuru County, go to: <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/39/Rongai.html>.The following information was provided by a reliable local source: Anthrax bovine was confirmed with 3 cases of cows that died. Reports from the local say the affected meat from the dead cows was also spread to other parts of the country. That the disease was limited to cutaneous lesions frankly surprises me. We normally expect to see some reports of severe enteric infections, and these are not infrequently lethal. But if the meat is well cooked it can be relatively safe, but I don't recommend testing this at the dining table. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/47100>.]
