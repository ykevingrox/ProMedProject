Probably the most well-known species is _Vibrio cholerae_. Currently, there are over 130 known serogroups based on the presence of somatic O antigens [1,2]. Serogroup O1 and to a lesser extent O139, is notorious for cholera outbreaks of diarrhea due to toxin production that is, cholera toxin: ctx and toxin co-regulated pilus subunit A: tcpA. Infections are mostly confined to the gastro-intestinal tract [1].In contrast, _V. cholerae_ non-O1 (VCNO) that is, all serogroups except O1, rarely causes cholera-like outbreaks in form of mild diarrhea due to toxin-producing VCNO strains but can cause severe extra intestinal infections such as wound infections and bacteremia [3,4]. Cases of VCNO bacteremia are reported in various countries and known risk factors are liver disease/cirrhosis and immunosuppression or immunocompromising conditions [1,3,4]. Sources of infection include seafood and contaminated water [5]. In the Netherlands, VCNO has indeed been isolated from recreational surface water (fresh and brackish) and sporadically from livestock [5,6]. In contrast, a Dutch study from 2010 showed that none of the examined shellfish tested positive for _V. cholerae_ [7]._V. cholerae_ is a facultative anaerobic Gram-negative curved or comma-shaped motile bacillus. It can be isolated from blood by using standard culture media such as blood agar [1]. Biochemical properties of this organism include catalase positivity, oxidase positivity, sucrose fermentation and susceptibility for the vibriostatic compound O129. Identification methods are various and include: matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analyser (MALDI-TOF, Bruker corporation), VITEK systems (BioMerieux corporation) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 16S and target genes like toxR, ompW, and sodB. The non-O1 serogroup can be distinguished from other serotypes by a lack of agglutination with O1-Ogawa and O1-Inaba antigen [1].In 2013, a patient with a fulminant VCNO sepsis and extensive bullae on the lower extremities was admitted to the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC). When searching for literature on VCNO sepsis to help determine the source of infection and the optimal treatment strategy, we realised that the available literature appeared to be limited to case reports and small case series. In order to provide evidence for clinicians and public health experts about VCNO bacteremia we report on a series of 3 cases and summarize the available literature on VCNO bacteremia.Clinical case reports---------------------During the presentation of the LUMC case at the annual Dutch convention for medical microbiology, we inquired if any of the attending medical microbiologists was aware of additional cases of VCNO sepsis detected in the Netherlands. There is no mandatory notification for VCNO isolates in the Netherlands and VCNO sepsis is rare. Thus, retrieving VCNO sepsis cases detected in the Netherlands in another fashion was not feasible.Literature review-----------------In collaboration with an experienced information specialist of the LUMC library, we formulated a search strategy including synonyms for '_V. cholerae_ non-O1' and 'bacteremia' and applied it to PubMed, Medline, Web of Science and Embase databases (Table 1 -[for all Tables, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Articles published before 15 Sep 2014 were included. Additional articles were identified by checking the references of relevant articles and duplicates were excludedResults-------Clinical case reports---------------------In addition to the LUMC case, 2 additional cases were detected in different Dutch medical centres in 2006 and 2007. A relevant selection of the available data per case is presented; none of the isolates were tested for toxin production. All cases were men and above 50 years of age, with infections during the summer season.Case 1------Case 1 was a man in his 50s, with a medical history of tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, marijuana, and excessive alcohol use. One day prior to admission, he felt lethargic and developed a painful discoloration on his right ankle. 3 days before hospital admission he had walked barefoot along the Dutch shoreline and ate a ready-made tuna salad. Upon admission at the emergency department (ED) he was hypothermic (34.1 deg C [93.38 deg F]), blood pressure was 112/70 mm Hg, heart rate 115 per minute, O2 saturation was 90 percent without additional oxygen. While in the ED he developed circulatory failure.There were no abnormalities on chest auscultation. Inspection of the lower extremities showed oedema, blue discoloration, and large bullae on both lower extremities. The chest X-ray showed patchy bilateral abnormalities of which the differential diagnosis comprised acute respiratory distress syndrome, bilateral pneumonia and pre-existing abnormalities after pulmonary tuberculosis.The putative diagnosis was septic shock due to deep skin infection. [Additional laboratory data can be found in the source URL above. - Mod.LL] Empirical antimicrobial treatment with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and selective digestive decontamination with polymyxin E, tobramycin, and amphotericin B, was initiated, and the patient was resuscitated, started on vasopressors and admitted to the intensive care unit. Necrotizing fasciitis was excluded upon surgical exploration. As VCNO non-O139 was isolated from blood and bullae content on admission day 3, antimicrobial treatment was switched to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. On the 8th admission day, the patient developed multi-organ failure (MOF). With the working diagnosis 'hospital acquired infection', gentamicin and flucloxacillin were added. The next day, blood cultures showed _Candida albicans_ and before additional treatment was started the patient died from MOF and sepsis. At post-mortem examination _C. albicans_ and _Aspergillus fumigatus_, but no _Vibrio_ spp were cultured from several organs including lungs, spleen, liver, and intestine.Within 24 hours from presentation at the ED blood cultures and cultures of bullae content grew rod-shaped/curved Gram-negative bacteria which were oxidase-, katalase- and DNase-positive. MALDI-TOF analysis showed _V. albensis_ with a score of 2.0 which corresponds with a secure identification on genus level and probable identification on species level (norm: 2.0 to 2.3). Additional biochemical testing (i.e. API 20E, Biomerieux) indicated _V. cholerae_. The microorganism did not agglutinate with O1-Ogawa or O1-Inaba antisera, was sensitive to the vibriostatic compound O/129 and was therefore labelled VCNO. This finding was confirmed and supplemented i.e. non-O 139, by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM). In house susceptibility testing by disk diffusion showed ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole sensitivity. Cultures of the tuna salad packaging did not reveal any Vibrio spp.Case 2------A man in his late 60s with a medical history of heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II, a cholecystectomy and an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, presented to the ED with severe diarrhea. 2 weeks earlier, while on one of the Dutch islands, he suffered from severe diarrhea for 2 days after having eaten raw herring. There was initial improvement, but the watery diarrhea recurred and he consulted a general practitioner who referred him to hospital. There was no blood or mucus in his stool. He did not report any surface water contact.Upon hospital admission, the patient was mildly icteric and had dyspnea, lowered O2 saturation of 91 percent without supplemental oxygen. He was tachycardic (129/minute), blood pressure was slightly elevated and he had a temperature of 38 deg C [100.4 deg F]. Aside from abdominal distention, physical examination of the abdomen, heart, lungs, and skin on the extremities showed no abnormalities. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed no abnormalities except steatosis hepatis [fatty liver] and liver cysts (4Ûäcm [about 1.6 in] in diameter). The electrocardiogram and abdominal X-ray were normal. The chest X-ray revealed signs of congestive heart failure. [Additional laboratory data can be found at the source URL above. - Mod.LL]The diagnosis was sepsis and after obtaining blood cultures, treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and gentamicin was initiated according to the local sepsis treatment protocol. On the 2nd admission day, the Gram-negative rod was isolated and suspected to be _Salmonella_ spp. Treatment was switched to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Later that day, as the isolate tested oxidase-positive, the working microbiologic diagnosis was changed to _Pseudomonas_ spp. and treatment was switched to ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin was continued after the identification of _V. cholerae_. The patient recovered fully, was discharged after 5 days with oral ciprofloxacin, and returned to his island holiday.One day after hospital admission, blood cultures became positive with Gram-negative rods, later identified as _V. cholerae_ (Phoenix Automated Microbiology System, BD diagnostics, and API E, Biomerieux). The isolate was sent to the RIVM and the biochemical profile, fatty acid analysis, and 16S rDNA PCR showed _V. cholerae_ non-O1 non-O139. Stool cultures remained negative for _Vibrio_ spp. With standard disk diffusion the isolate tested susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cefuroxime, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, meropenem, tobramycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. It was intermediately sensitive to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefazolin, and resistant to ceftriaxone.Case 3------A man in his early 70s presented at the ED with general malaise, dizziness, decreased appetite, coughing, and dyspnea that had been lasting for one week. Relevant medical history comprised heart failure and a hepatojejunostomy for chronic cholangitis more than a decade before presentation. He had not been travelling or swimming, but habitually caught eel in the Ijsselmeer lake that summer and cleaned the eel himself. He did not report having consumed the eel or having had contact with lake water other than taking eel out of fishing nets, or of wounds or lacerations on his hands before his illness.Upon hospital admission, he had a temperature of 39 deg C [102.2 deg F], heart rate of 66/minute, blood pressure of 110/70 mm/Hg and oxygen saturation was normal without oxygen administration. He was disorientated and had trouble concentrating. There were no signs of gastroenteritis or abnormalities on chest examination. No apparent skin lesions were reported. [Additional laboratory data can be found at the source URL above. - Mod.LL]The patient was initially empirically treated for sepsis with ceftriaxone and gentamicin, then switched to oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. He recovered completely and was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization.Within 24 hours after admission, blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods. On TCBS agar, yellow colonies appeared which tested oxidase negative. Identification through API NE (Biomerieux corporation) showed _V. cholerae_ (code 7074745, ID 99.0 percent), which was confirmed with 16S PCR. The isolate's susceptibility was tested using standard disk diffusion on Muller Hinton agar plates. It was susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, meropenem, gentamicin. Sputum cultures were negative for _Vibrio_ spp. The eel were not examined microbiologically, therefore the source of infection remained unclear.Review------The initial search yielded 163 unique articles and 155 duplicates (Figure 1). Reference checking resulted in identification of 2 additional unique articles. Of the 165 retrieved articles, 77 were excluded based on title or abstract, leaving 88 articles including 82 case reports [8-89] and 6 articles reporting case series [90-95].Case reports------------The 82 articles retrieved covered 90 patients; 23 (26 percent) of them were female and the mean age was 49 (0-84) years. Cases were reported worldwide; 22 (25 percent) were identified in Europe, 19 (21 percent) in the United States of America, 30 (33 percent) in the Asian continent and 19 (21 percent) in the remaining continents. The remaining case characteristics are presented in Table 2 (extraction table for data available from authors upon request).The most frequently reported symptom was gastroenteritis (51/90; 57 percent) followed by fever without gastroenteritis (26/90; 29 percent) and bullae (18/90; 20 percent). However, also rare presentations such as endophthalmitis and neonatal meningitis were reported. Overall known risk factors such as consumption or handling of seafood or consumption or contact with possibly contaminated water were reported in 45 cases (45/90; 50 percent). Of the 47 patients (47/90; 52 percent) presenting with gastroenteritis and no bullae, 15 (15/47) reported prior seafood consumption, 5 (5/47) reported fishing (possibly implying consumption), and for 9 cases (9/47) no exposure data were reported; no information on exposure was available for the remaining 18 cases. In five cases (5/90; 6 percent) authors hypothesized on additional risk factors such as indirect contact with raw seafood such as contaminated baby bathwater/bottle (2/5) and administration of the oral _V. cholerae_ vaccine (3/5). However, the vaccine contains killed whole _V. cholerae_ cells with or without recombinant B-sub unit and the nature of the alleged link to VCNO infection was not clarified by the authors. As our case definition of VCNO sepsis included bacteremia, a positive blood culture was reported for all patients. Additional samples that were positive for VCNO are shown in Table 2. 31 patients died due to their VCNO infection, which results in an overall case-fatality rate of 348 per 1000 for this selected sample.For 62 cases (62/90; 69 percent), susceptibility data of the _V. cholerae_ non-O1 isolates were provided (extraction table available from authors upon request). Overall, in vitro resistance was observed to amoxicillin (4/50 tested (intermediately) resistant), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (4/37), ciprofloxacin (2/24), gentamicin (1/37), and doxycycline (3/38). Antimicrobials to which V. cholerae non-O1 isolates appeared to be susceptible in vitro, without exception, were cephalothin (n=14 tested), cefuroxime (n=10), cefotaxime (n=14), ceftazidime (n=12), ceftriaxone (n=15), amikacin (n=17), and chloramphenicol (n=33). Toxin production of the isolates was not consistently reported in literature and therefore not included in the analysis.Case series-----------Details of the 6 retrieved case series were extracted and analysed briefly given the selected nature of the sample (Table 2). Altogether, 82 patients with VCNO bacteremia were retrieved, the majority of reports originating from the Asian continent. As in the 3 case reports described above, most patients were male. In contrast, fever was the most frequent presenting symptom and risk factors could be identified in only a minority of patients (24/82; 29 percent). Overall, the number of cases reported peaked in 1996, 1998, 2007, and 2011 (Figure 2).Discussion-----------------We presented 3 cases of VCNO [and 2 of the 3 also known to be non-O139. - Mod.LL] bacteremia that were identified in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2013 as well as 172 cases from literature occurring between 1980 and 2014. Corresponding with current knowledge, both the recently identified cases and the previously reported ones show that patients are typically male, often have a history of liver/bile duct disease and the presenting symptoms often include gastroenteritis, fever, and bullae [1]. The suspected sources while seldom confirmed microbiologically, are commonly fish and surface water. In contrast to previous reports, however, we found that a great variety in clinical presentation does occur, ranging from lethargy to meningitis, endophthalmitis, cough, and dyspnoea [1]. Severe outcomes include neurological impairment, lower limb amputation, and death. All 3 Dutch cases presented during summer, the season of recreational activities such as fishing, swimming, and of flourishing microorganisms in surface waters due to rising temperatures [96-98].A major strength of our analysis is that it provides a complete overview of what is known about VCNO bacteremia, whereas other reports merely describe individual cases or a selection of case reports. The search was formulated by an experienced scientist (MFE) and an information specialist (JS) and articles were provided by the LUMC library which has access to over 9000 leading (bio-)medical journals. Therefore, we consider that this review includes all relevant published articles published in Dutch and English and provides a complete overview of the available literature on VCNO bacteraemia.The summary of data on antimicrobial susceptibility provided here may assist physicians in choosing an adequate treatment regimen. The data indicate that administration of a cephalosporin is likely to be the best option when dealing with VCNO bacteremia. However, an important factor that hinders the extrapolation of our data to clinical practice is publication bias, many authors did not report susceptibility data. This is crucial when evaluating resistance data, as many authors solely reported the susceptibility to antimicrobials administered to the patient in question. Additional relevant data on antimicrobial resistance that may very well have been available to the authors was not published.After searching current literature for the aetiology of VCNO bacteremia, we could not reveal why males are affected more frequently than females, but found a similar trend in infections with other _Vibrio_ spp [99]. The role of immunocompromising conditions in acquiring VCNO bacteremia seems clear and the influence of liver cirrhosis can probably be attributed to high ferritin levels which are required for the metabolism of _Vibrio_ spp [100].Aside from predisposing conditions and exposure, bacterial virulence may very well play a significant role in the pathogenesis of VCNO bacteraemia. VCNO toxins are being studied and several are known, such as ctx; large excretion of fluids and electrolytes into the lumen hlyAET; hemolysin, rtxA; actin cross linking, hap; haemagglutinin protease, type 3 and 6 secretion system, nanH; neuraminidase, NAG-ST; heat-stable enterotoxin. The clinical significance of these toxins (such as their role in bulla formation, remains yet to be determined [101,102].In conclusion, VCNO bacteremia is a disease that can be fatal and poses a threat around the globe especially to patients with a history of alcohol abuse and/or liver cirrhosis. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of VCNO bacteraemia in patients presenting with gastroenteritis, fever, or bullae after consumption of or contact with seafood or potentially contaminated water. However, risk factors often remain unidentified, the clinical presentation varies greatly and a quick microbiological diagnosis is indispensable. Cephalosporins are likely the best treatment option for VCNO bacteremia.[For references: see source URL above - Mod. LL]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is important to note that in patients with appropriate risk factors especially cirrhosis and diabetes, non-O1, non-O139 human _Vibrio cholera_ infections can produce bacteremia and severe illness with hemorrhagic bullae and necrotizing fasciitis quite similar to _V. vulnificus_.The posting refers to serotypes of _Vibrio cholerae_ that are neither O1 nor O139. In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for either cholera toxin or the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). Yet, some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram-negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6).References----------1.
