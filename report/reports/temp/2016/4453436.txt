If a facility is using a quaternary ammonium based disinfectant (Quat) with a 10 minute contact time, it will be very hard to keep the environment disinfected (Sattar SA, et al. Chemical disinfection to interrupt transfer of rhinovirus type 14 from environmental surfaces to hands. Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993;59(5):1579-1585). I would suggest that the disinfectant being used have a non-enveloped virus claim (poliovirus, norovirus) when there is an ongoing outbreak of rhinovirus.--Jim Gauthier, MLT, CICSenior Clinical Advisor, Infection Prevention<james.gauthier@sealedair.com><http://www.sealedair.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Mr Gauthier for his important comment distinguishing disinfection of surfaces contaminated with enveloped vs non-enveloped viruses. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.][See Also:Rhinovirus - USA: (NY) veterans home 20160827.44451231996---Rhinovirus outbreak - Maryland (USA) 19961212.2059].................................................lk/je/sh"
