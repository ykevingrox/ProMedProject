WHO Surveillance and monitoring, influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update - 279 (based on data up to 11 Dec, 2016)--------------------------------------Summary-------Influenza activity in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere increased slightly, with some countries passing their seasonal threshold, which is early for the season. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) virus was predominant.- In North America, influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating. Influenza-like illness (ILI) levels remained below seasonal thresholds. In the United States, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity continued to be reported.- In Europe, influenza activity was low but has started to rise, with a positivity rate of 28 percent among sentinel surveillance samples. The highest numbers of influenza cases were detected in Norway and Sweden. In Southwest Europe, influenza activity was higher in Portugal and Spain.- In East Asia, influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H3N2) remaining the dominant virus circulating.- In Western Asia, influenza detections slightly increased.- In Northern Africa, influenza detections were reported in Morocco, with influenza A(H3N2) virus dominating.- In the Caribbean countries, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low. In Central America, there was a slight decrease in influenza and other respiratory viruses activity in most of the countries. In Costa Rica, influenza activity increased, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulating, and RSV activity continued to be reported.- In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory viruses activity remained low with the exception of Colombia where both influenza and RSV activity continued to be reported.- In Southern Asia, influenza detections slightly increased in both Iran and Sri Lanka, with influenza A(H3N2) as the most frequently detected virus in this region.- In Southeast Asia, influenza activity continued to be reported at low levels, with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominant in the region.- In West Africa, influenza detections increased in Ghana with B viruses dominating.- In Southern Africa, influenza activity continued at inter-seasonal levels.- In temperate South America, influenza and RSV activity continued to decrease throughout the sub-region.- In Oceania, influenza virus activity was reported at inter-seasonal levels.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 91 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 28 Nov 2016 to 11 Dec 2016 (data as of 22 Dec 2016 14:50:28 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 115 769 specimens during that period. 12 979 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 12 221 (94.2%) were typed as influenza A and 758 (5.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 118 (1.5 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 7709 (98.5 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 74 (48.1 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 80 (51.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[Since the last update, a slight increase in influenza activity was reported from most regions (except the Caribbean, Central America and most of tropical South America), with influenza A/H3N2 predominating.Regarding influenza B detection, although quite low overall, the distribution of B-Yamagata and B-Victoria has been nearly equal; it would be a good season to evaluate the impact of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (containing both influenza B lineage representative strains). - Mod.UBA]******[2] Ukraine - School ClosuresDate: 25 Dec 2016 Source: Szaopressa [in Russian, trans. edited]<http://szaopressa.com/><http://www.healthmap.org/ai.php?4722323&trto=en&trfr=ru&pid1892>In Kiev, 132 schools are closed [due to an] epidemic of influenza.---Date: 26 Dec 2016Source: HealthMap [in Russian, trans. edited]<http://www.healthmap.org/ai.php?4723683&trto=en&trfr=ru&pid8939>Flu epidemic in Ukraine: Ivano-Frankivsk school closed for quarantine.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] MexicoDate: 23 Dec 2016Source: Excelsior [in Spanish, trans. edited]<http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2016/12/23/1136031>118 cases of influenza reported from October to December 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] CanadaDate: 23 Dec 2016Source: The Daily Courier [edited]<http://www.kelownadailycourier.ca/news/local_news/article_df3f75ec-c981-11e6-b5f1-8b626f028c09.html>More people have gotten the flu in the interior this season [2016-17] than in the previous 2 years, and those numbers are likely to continue increasing, says Interior Health. ""To date, we have had 84 lab-confirmed cases of influenza in the interior,"" said Pam De Bruin, manager of communicable diseases and immunization programs at IH.""In the Central Okanagan, there have been 30 lab-confirmed cases this season, which is 36 per cent of the total for Interior Health.""The number of lab-confirmed cases of the flu has been rising over the past 3 weeks in particular, she said. ""Overall, there were 29 cases this past week and 14 in the prior week.""These numbers are higher than in the previous 2 years, and they do not include people who did not seek medical attention, said De Bruin.This upward trend of flu cases is expected to continue into the new year [2017]. ""Typically, influenza picks up in the last week of December and in the 1st few weeks of January,"" said De Bruin. ""We're only entering the time when typically influenza activity picks up.""The good news is that this year's [2016] flu vaccine is a good match for the strain going around, which has predominantly been H3N2, said De Bruin.Many pharmacies have already run out of their supply of flu shots, including London Drugs in West Kelowna, which ran out of its 1st batch of doses in the middle of November 2016, said staff pharmacist Brian Smith.His pharmacy received another batch of doses, which was also used up. ""We do have some of the privately funded ones people have to pay for, but we're out of the publicly-funded ones,"" he said. Interior Health initially ordered 210 000 doses of the vaccine, which was 10 000 fewer doses than the year before.""Interior Health places their vaccine order in February, and it's based on the uptake that was seen in the previous year,"" said De Bruin. ""Initially, we had ordered 210 000 doses, but the demand for vaccine was good this year [2016], so we ordered another 7700, which we received at the end of November 2016.""IH is not planning on ordering any more doses, but will be redistributing doses depending on where the need is, said De Bruin. ""We've got continued demand for a vaccine in some communities, and public health has been distributing any remaining vaccines we can find to communities with low supply.""With flu season expected to get worse over the next few weeks, it is not too late to get the flu shot, said De Bruin. ""We encourage flu shots to the end of the season, but the earlier you get it, the better,"" she said. ""It takes up to 2 weeks to get the optimal response from the vaccine.""To avoid the flu this holiday season, Smith advises keeping a safe distance from other people and taking precautionary measures at home.""Replacing hand towels or using paper towels when washing hands is a good idea, because viruses can remain alive for several hours on fabrics in the household,"" said Smith. ""Also making sure to sanitize your house, including door handles, TV remotes, phones and keyboards, because germs can live up to 24 hours from the time they've been transferred onto a surface.""[Byline: Andrea Peacock]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
