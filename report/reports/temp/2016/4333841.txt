East Oregonian [edited]<http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/local-news/20160707/west-nile-detected-near-umatilla-stanfield>West Nile virus has been detected in 2 mosquito samples in Umatilla County, one east of Umatilla and one on the southern edge of Stanfield.The samples were collected 28 Jun [2016], and testing was done at the Oregon State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on 6 Jul [2016]. It's the 1st detection of West Nile in Oregon so far this year [2016].Residents can expect an increase in mosquito control operations, including Ultra-Low Volume applications of insecticide from truck-mounted sprayers. Spraying will typically be done after sunset, when mosquitoes are most active. All applicators are licensed by the Oregon Department of Agriculture.West Nile is primarily a bird disease, with magpies, blue jays and crows especially susceptible. Mosquitoes feed on infected birds and can pass the virus to humans or other animals when they bite. Most people infected with West Nile [virus] do not become sick, but some may develop mild flu-like symptoms and, in rare cases, the virus may cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain.The risk of West Nile is low, but the public is encouraged to take precautions against mosquito bites. People can reduce their exposure to mosquitoes by avoiding outdoor activities at dawn or dusk, when mosquitoes are active, using mosquito repellent or wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when working in mosquito-infested areas.Other tips include screening doors and windows, and getting rid of old tires or other containers where water can accumulate and serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Those with horses should check with their veterinarians for vaccinations and be sure to flush or replace the water in their troughs weekly.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is prudent for the residents of the area to be warned to ""fight the bite"" and avoid mosquito bites, now that West Nile virus (WNV) has been detected in mosquitoes, heralding the beginning of the WNV transmission season there. It seems odd that the report focuses on avoidance of infection by people but does not urge horse owners to be sure that their animals are vaccinated. Repeated and timely insecticide applications can reduce vector mosquito populations.A map showing the location of Umatilla county in northeastern Oregon can be accessed at <http://geology.com/county-map/oregon.shtml>. - Mod.TY]******[2] UtahDate: Thu 7 Jul 2016Source: Deseret News [edited]<http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865657613/Utahns-advised-to-vaccinate-horses-for-West-Nile-virus.html?pg=all>Due to the rise in temperatures and mosquito populations, Utah horse owners are being advised to vaccinate their horses to protect them from the West Nile virus.Data show that 80 percent of cases in horses occur during August and September. The virus is spread by mosquitos and can affect both humans and animals.""[WNV-caused disease] is reportable and is part of our statewide information and alert system designed to protect animal and human health,"" Barry Pittman, state veterinarian, said in a prepared statement. ""Our Animal Health Program is part of a regional and national notification system designed to prevent the spread of diseases that affect livestock and the human population. Any equine with (the virus) would be prevented from traveling across state lines,"" he added.Mosquito monitoring for West Nile continues throughout the state and is ongoing throughout peak months. To date, no human or animal cases of West Nile virus have been reported, but laboratory test results confirm the presence of mosquitoes carrying the virus in the Vernal area.The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food is strongly advising horse owners to protect their animals by vaccinating them. Because the equine vaccine requires 2 doses, 2 weeks apart, and takes approximately 5 weeks to offer full protection, horse owners are advised to vaccinate their animals as early as possible. Once animals are vaccinated, yearly booster shots are necessary.Horse owners can further protect their animals by applying approved repellents, controlling mosquitoes and eliminating mosquito-breeding areas. Horse owners may also put their animals in a barn or other enclosed structures during high mosquito activity times, typically evenings and morning hours.The most common sign of West Nile virus [infection] in horses is weakness, usually in the hindquarters. Weakness may be indicated by a widened stance, stumbling, leaning to one side and toe dragging. In extreme cases, paralysis may follow, with the horse unable to stand, leading to humane euthanasia. Fever is sometimes evident, as are depression and fearfulness. The virus causes encephalitis and affects the central nervous system.Statistically, one in 3 horses that show signs of the illness will die, and horse owners who suspect their animals are infected should contact their veterinarian immediately. Prevention is more effective, economical and humane.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report presents an interesting contrast to the one above from Oregon. In this Utah report, emphasis is on prevention of infection of equine animals through timely vaccination ahead of the most active virus transmission season. No mention is made of ""fight the bite"" for people to avoid being infected by vector mosquitoes. Owners of equine animals would certainly be wise to follow the state veterinarian's advice and vaccinate their animals now.A map showing the location of Vernal in Uintah county northeastern Utah can be accessed at <http://geology.com/county-map/utah.shtml>.These 2 reports illustrate why a ""one health"" approach to disease risk is needed. Humans and equine animals are part of ecosystems that contain vector mosquitoes and the viruses that they carry, and both are at risk of infection and serious disease. Separating humans from animals with which they share the landscape provides only part of a picture that needs to be holistic.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the USA showing the location of the 2 western states can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>. - Mod.TY]
