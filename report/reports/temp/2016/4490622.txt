The Seattle Times [edited]< http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/new-e-coli-cases-reported-but-no-apparent-link-to-the-matador/>For the 2nd time in a week, King County health officials are investigating an outbreak of potentially dangerous _Escherichia coli_ food poisoning linked to a Mexican-style restaurant, but they say the incidents don't appear related. An outbreak of Shiga-toxin producing _E. coli_ O157:H7 (EHEC) sickened 2 people who ate at Memo's Mexican Food in Seattle's University District in August 2016, officials with Public Health -- Seattle & King County reported on Wed [14 Sep 2016].Laboratory testing showed those illnesses were caused by the same strain of the bacteria. But it's different from the strain that has sickened 10 other people, including 6 who ate at the Matador restaurant in Ballard in August 2016.""These clusters do not appear related to each other,"" according to a public health notice posted on Wed [14 Sep 2016]. An investigation on Mon [12 Sep 2016] revealed other factors that could have contributed to the outbreak at Memo's. Those included improper cooling, cold-holding, reheating of potentially hazardous food and the potential for cross-contamination. Because the violations were corrected on site, and there was not an ongoing risk, the restaurant was not closed. Inspectors will return in 14 days to ensure that the site remains safe.A King County resident ate at the restaurant on 18 and 24 Aug 2016, while another Washington resident ate there on 24 Aug 2016. Health officials received the 1st report on 31 Aug 2016. Since 2010, the restaurant has received 9 unsatisfactory inspection reviews, according to public-health records. Most involved improper temperature control.[byline: JoNel Aleccia]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These cases are separate from the previously reported outbreak. Although both outbreaks are due to serotype O157:H7, the strains are not identical by other testing. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4512>.]
