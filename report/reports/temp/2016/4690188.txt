The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/Threat-of-JE-diminishing-in-Malkangiri-district/article16782086.ece>No new patient with encephalitis syndrome has been admitted in Malkangiri district headquarter hospital in the last 4 days, hinting that the threat of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is diminishing in this remote tribal district of Odisha.As per reports, during past 3 months around 120 children have died due to lethal viral disease JE or by consumption of beans of _Cassia occidentalis_ locally known as 'bada chakunda'. Anthraquinone, a toxin found in _Cassia occidentalis_ was also alleged to be cause of encephalopathy and deaths among children.To prevent deaths of children, the administration had decided to transport any child suffering from encephalitis syndrome to the district hospital as early as possible. For the 1st time in the last 3 months, no new patient with such syndrome has been admitted in the district hospital. ""It is surely a spark of hope for all in the district including government officials, physicians, health workers, teachers, anganwadi [government sponsored child-care and mother-care centers] workers, ASHA [foundation] volunteers, panchayat bodies [system of local governance], social workers, and even security personnel, who have worked relentless since September [2016] to check encephalitis deaths of innocent children in the district,"" said Malkangiri collector K Sudarshan Chakravarthy.As per the office of Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO), Malkangiri, the 15-day-long mass vaccination of children is continuing successfully in the district since [5 Dec 2016]. Initially, children of all major schools in the district are being vaccinated.In the next phase, all other children would be vaccinated through grassroot level community approach. A total of 218 027 children are to be vaccinated against JE in the district.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[An 8 Dec 2016 report stated that about 84 percent of children had already been vaccinated by [Wed 7 Dec 2016], with 175 vaccination centres currently functioning in the district. Until now, the total deaths due to JE, acute encephalitis syndrome, and encephalopathy reached 103, which is below that of the most afflicted states like Uttar Pradesh with the highest (538 cases), West Bengal (229), and Assam (183). Confirmed reports said that JE alone accounted for 37 deaths (<http://pragativadi.com/je-outbreak-control-govt/>).The absence of new cases is good news indeed. It is also good to learn that the childhood JE vaccination program has begun and will continue. An earlier report also indicated that the local populace is being advised to avoid consumption of _Cassia occidentalis_ seeds by children, although some local health officials doubted that the seeds were responsible for the acute encephalitis syndrome (non-JE but without specific diagnosis). One hopes that this outbreak has ended.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]
