The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sikkim-inches-closer-to-mumbai-in-multidrugresistant-tb-cases/article8847013.ece>Sikkim has emerged as the next big concern on India's already riddled tuberculosis [TB] map with 11 percent of the new tuberculosis cases in the state found to be multi-drug-resistant (MDR), a figure almost on par with the country's TB capital, Mumbai. In the rest of India, multi-drug resistance in new TB cases is pegged at around 2 percent.The Sikkim government held a meeting with various health agencies last week and is drawing up a plan to tackle the concern. ""Recently, we held a workshop to collate all the information that the state has and find out ways to tackle the MDR and overall TB cases. We are also better equipped with modern diagnostic machines,"" Prem Das Rai, Member of Parliament from Sikkim told The Hindu .What has surprised TB experts is the similarity emerging from 2 vastly different geographies: Mumbai, a port city known for its high-density slums and clustered living, and Sikkim, an idyllic state nestled in the Himalayan range.While the reason for Sikkim's high MDR burden is still being explored, the Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR) institute in Dibrugarh (Assam) studied 120 MDR-TB strains of patients from Sikkim over the past year and identified 70 per cent of them as 'Beijing strains'. ""The study is not published yet and we do not have a definitive explanation, but Beijing strain is more common in the northeast, China and Tibet,"" Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, director-general, ICMR told The Hindu. She said the strain is considered to be more virulent with a higher tendency to develop drug resistance.Mumbai, with a population of 1.3 crore [13 million], recorded over 27 000 TB cases last year [2015], of which 3300 were MDR-TB cases. In comparison, Sikkim, with a population of 6.1 lakh [610 000], recorded less than 2000 cases last year, of which over 200 cases were of MDR-TB. ""In numbers, Mumbai has the highest MDR-TB burden, but in proportion, Sikkim's burden is now almost on par. It is quite surprising. Sikkim is different from Mumbai. There is no overcrowding and the risk factors are different. We will undertake a full situational analysis and look at all risk factors,"" said Dr. Swaminathan.Union health officials also pointed to factors that make Sikkim an unlikely candidate for a high burden. ""The state has high nutrition and education levels,"" said Dr. Sunil Khaparde, Deputy Director General of the Central Tuberculosis Division. As per Census 2011, Sikkim's literacy rate is 81.42 percent. Dr. Khaparde said a molecular and an epidemiological study will be undertaken to study the reason.TB experts said while Sikkim has been recording drug-resistant cases for some time, technology is now available to map it accurately. ""After the GeneXpert TB test was brought, it has improved our capacity to understand drug resistance,"" said Nerges Mistry, director of Foundation for Medical Research, who attended the meeting at Gangtok last week.[Byline: Roli Srivastava]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Sikkim, with a population of 607 688 inhabitants, located in the Himalayan mountains, is bordered by China's Tibet Autonomous Region to the north and east, Bhutan to the east, Nepal to the west, and the Indian state of West Bengal to the south (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim>). Sikkim is the least populous state in India and the 2nd-smallest state after Goa in total area. Sikkim's capital and largest city is Gangtok, with 100 000 residents (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangtok>).MDR TB is a form of tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least isoniazid plus rifampin, the 2 most potent 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB), a subset of MDR TB, is a form of TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the 3 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).WHO estimated that 2. 2 percent of new TB cases in India and 15 percent of relapsed cases have multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) (<http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr15_main_text.pdf>) and about 40 percent (0.5 billion) of the Indian population is infected with TB bacteria, the vast majority of whom have latent rather than active TB (<http://www.tbfacts.org/tb-india/>). Poverty, crowded unsanitary living conditions, malnutrition and other nutritional deficiencies, diabetes, and AIDS are factors that contribute to India's TB epidemic, in addition to poor quality and shortages in supply of anti-TB drugs and lack of laboratory facilities to diagnose TB and do susceptibility testing. Also, many TB patients are said to seek care with private practitioners, who are poorly trained to manage TB treatment, which contributes to the frequency of multi-drug resistance (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23008922>, <http://www.wired.com/2012/01/invincible-tb-india/>). Untreated or inappropriately treated MDR TB patients remain contagious, spreading MDR TB in the community.The GeneXpert TB test referred to in the news report above is an integrated, automated, closed system, which enables rapid detection of DNA sequences present in sputum samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, as well as mutations in a gene that confer resistance to rifampin. Rifampin resistance is used as a surrogate marker for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Testing is completed within 2 hours, with minimal biohazard and performed by low-skilled workers who have very little technical training required to operate the equipment (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0907847>). A 4-module GeneXpert can process 16-20 specimens per 8-hour working day (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740172/>). Because the equipment is expensive, and requires regular maintenance, uninterrupted electrical line power, plus a temperature-controlled operating environment, it is unsuitable for more remote settings. The introduction of this system in Mumbai and the more recent introduction of this equipment in Sikkim uncovered their high rates of MDR TB. As the GeneXpert system is introduced into other locales in India, it is likely that high rates of MDR TB will be uncovered similar to that reported now in Mumbai and Sikkim. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/318>.]
