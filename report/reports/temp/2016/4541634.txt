The virus is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia.WNV is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Humans, horses and other mammals can all be infected. Infection with the virus can cause neurological disease and death in people. Vaccines are available for use in horses but not yet available for people. WNV infection in Romania is endemic in bird, horse, and human populations as shown by high seroprevalence rates in horses and sporadic reports of human cases on an annual basis. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>.]
