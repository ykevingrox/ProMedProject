Infection Control Today / WHO [edited]<http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2016/04/emergency-response-to-ebola-flareup-is-underway-in-liberia.aspx>The World Health Organization (WHO) and Ministry of Health teams in Liberia and Guinea are investigating the origins of transmission in Liberia's latest flare-up after learning that a woman who died from Ebola in Liberia last week had recently traveled from Guinea with her 3 young children.Liberian health authorities report that the woman arrived with her children on 21 Mar 2016, shortly after her husband died in Guinea from unknown causes. She stayed with relatives in Monrovia, where she developed symptoms over the following week. She initially sought care in local clinics and died en route to a Monrovia hospital on 31 Mar 2016.One of her boys has since tested positive for Ebola virus disease, bringing the number of cases in this flare-up to 2. He is being treated at an Ebola care facility in Monrovia. Her 2 other children, plus her sister, are being closely observed by medical staff.Liberian health authorities quickly reactivated the country's emergency response mechanisms and with support from key partners, immediately set to work tracing, isolating and monitoring contacts of the confirmed cases, intensifying infection prevention and disease control measures, and stepping up community outreach. Teams plan to initiate vaccination of contacts with the Ebola vaccine to prevent potential spread of the virus.84 contacts of the cases have been identified in Liberia as of today [4 Apr 2016] and have been placed under medical observation. Affected households have been offered food, water, hygiene supplies, and counseling.These latest cases in Liberia mark the country's 3rd flare-up of Ebola virus disease since its original outbreak was declared over on 9 May 2015. The previous flare-up in Liberia began in November 2015 and ended 14 Jan 2016.Last week, WHO said the Ebola epidemic in West Africa no longer represents a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, asserting that Guinea, Liberia and Sierra now have the detection and response capacities to effectively manage small outbreaks when they occur.While the risk of flare-ups is declining, WHO reiterated that more must be expected, largely due to virus persistence in some survivors. Nearly 1000 WHO specialists remain in the region ready to contribute to emergency response operations when needed and, in the meantime, working to recover and strengthen health systems in the 3 countries.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As the WHO warns, more Ebola outbreaks will likely occur. Therefore, it is critically important to rebuild the health care infrastructure in West Africa to be able to address Ebola, as well as other public health threats. It appears that Guinea and Liberia are responding appropriately to these latest cases. But closing the borders clearly was not an effective approach. - Mod.LK]******[2] Liberia: Ebola re-emergenceDate: Tue 5 Apr 2016Source: The New Dawn [edited]<http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/news/10014-ebola-woman-died-at-ma-wata>An official at the Health Ministry here told this paper on Mon [4 Apr 2016] evening that the source of the renewed Ebola outbreak fled neighboring Guinea with her kids following the death of her husband.The official said the woman who was pronounced dead upon arrival at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town, Monrovia last week had actually died at the local community clinic of Ma Watta in Jacob's Town on the outskirts of Monrovia before being taken to the Redemption Hospital.""Her sister took her dead body there and [left] her, after which she switched off her phone,"" the source, who pleaded anonymity, told this paper. ""She (sister) had moved out of the community with the 2 children and her 5-year-old son to [be] closer to the bush; that's where we had struggled to find her,"" the source said, adding: ""Now, her 5-year-old son is down with the virus, and we are using Z-Mapp to treat him.""The government has since announced the closure of the clinic to the public. But the clinic, which is located in a compound housing other residents, appears to have some staff around.A New Dawn's investigation into the Jacob Town community on Mon 4 Apr 2016 saw the premises closed and under renovation. But community sources confirmed that the woman, whose husband had died from Ebola earlier in neighboring Guinea, where there is a renewed outbreak, crossed into Liberia recently and was admitted at the Ma Watta clinic.Our investigators observed ongoing renovation work as contractors laid tiles and installed window glass.The Ministry of Health on Sun 3 Apr 2016 confirmed the new Ebola case and the subsequent death of the 30-year-old female victim in a press statement.The release said the woman was taken to the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town on Thu 31 Mar 2016 and pronounced dead on arrival. According to the release, her blood specimens were taken and tested positive for Ebola.Investigations are reportedly ongoing to identify the source of transmission and the line-listing of contacts. Health Ministry Communication Director Sorbor George disclosed that about 85 persons or contacts have been linked to the deceased, including 15 health workers.Mr. George said the index case (woman) and her 5-year-old daughter came from Guinea with the virus and resided in the Ne-zoe Community, Paynesville, adding that serious tracing is ongoing to identify the taxi driver who transported her and other people whom she may have come in contact with prior to her demise.Meanwhile, the 85 contacts, including 15 health workers, have been placed under surveillance by Health Ministry authorities. The latest Ebola case in Liberia came as a result of the renewed outbreak in neighboring Guinea, where over 800 persons have been reportedly vaccinated and 182 others placed at high risk.The Ministry of Health in Monrovia is urging the public to continue preventive measures such as washing hands with soap and clean water, communities exercising vigilance by reporting to community leaders and health officials any person showing signs and symptoms of Ebola and dead bodies, as well as to immediately dial the emergency number 4455 for concerns and information.[Byline: Ethel A.

The last fatality dates back to Sun [3 Apr 2016],"" said Ibrahima Sylla, spokesman for Guinea's Ebola response unit.Sylla said the victim -- a woman -- died at an Ebola treatment centre in the city of Nzerekore, where a handful of other patients have been cared for in recent weeks following a spate of cases among a family near the border with Liberia.""There is just one confirmed case still receiving treatment at the centre,"" he added.The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the new tolls and said it would look into links between the cases in Nzerekore and a woman who crossed the border from Guinea into Liberia, when it was briefly closed, before dying of the virus in Liberia's capital Monrovia.The victim's husband had died of Ebola in Guinea, after which she left the country with her children, the world health body said.One of her children has tested positive for the virus, while 2 others are being monitored, along with her sister.""Now the investigation is going to determine whether there is a link between those 2 flare-ups. It is understood that there is a person who was travelling from Guinea to Liberia who was tested positive,"" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic in Geneva.The WHO has said that Ebola no longer constitutes an international emergency, but the announcement of new cases in West Africa has demonstrated the difficulty of managing the aftermath of the virus.Jasarevic said a vaccination campaign was well underway in the area of Guinea where the new cases were registered, while monitoring of those in contact with the dead woman in Liberia was also a priority.""In Guinea, already 1200 people have been vaccinated. Right now, the work is ongoing in Liberia to monitor 90 so far identified contacts, and there is also a plan to vaccinate them,"" the WHO spokesman said.The Ebola epidemic was declared over in Guinea and Liberia months ago, though a significant number of deaths are believed to have gone unreported, and ""flare-ups"" relating to the persistence of the virus in survivors' bodies pose ongoing challenges.The WHO will hold a meeting this week with Liberian and Guinean authorities to work on cross-border surveillance, Jasarevic said.The deadliest period in the history of the feared tropical virus wrecked the economies and health systems of the 3 worst hit west African nations -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- after it emerged in December 2013.The virus has since claimed 11 300 lives.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Guinea and Liberia news, Sierra Leone, research, funding4 Apr 2016 Guinea, Liberia: New Ebola flare-up in Liberia<http://www.voanews.com/content/new-ebola-flare-up-in-liberia/3268005.html>[Just a few days after his mother's death from [Ebola virus disease (EVD)], a 5-year-old boy tested positive for EVD. The mother left her home in Guinea, where relatives had contracted EVD, and traveled to Monrovia [Liberia] for treatment, crossing the border (with 3 children and her sister) between Guinea and Liberia. According to Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah, there are strong indications they crossed the border when it was closed. She subsequently died from EVD. Her death followed a recent flare-up that took the lives of at least 4 people in neighboring Guinea.Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah, who is also head of Liberia's Ebola Incident Management System, said the latest flare-up has been traced to Guinea. But he said, unlike in the past, Liberia's health system has the capacity to deal with the flare-up. Nyenswah said: ""Liberia has confirmed another case of Ebola, making it 2 cases: the index case of the deceased mother, 30 years old, and now her 5-year-old son who is in the Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia. But this is something that we are comfortable dealing with right now because of the capacity that the country has to respond through our Incident Management System.""Neighboring Guinea announced new cases of Ebola last month [March 2016], and Liberia immediately closed its border with Guinea. It also dispatched health teams to various border crossings.Nyenswah said: ""From our investigation, there is strong indication that this is an imported case linked to the cluster in Guinea. The border is so porous. There are some that are official; there are some that are unofficial. And so this is the situation we are faced with. ... Health officials were able to track down all those who might have had close contacts with the deceased woman. In less than 24 hours, our system was able to pick up the clinic that she visited [Paynesville] [prior to her death.] We were able to pick up health care workers who had contacts. They are under voluntary, precautionary observation. We were able to pick up the family members that she was visiting in Liberia. All of them are in the ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit],"" he said.Nyenswah also said the government has urged Liberians not to panic and to continue to take the preventive measures put in place at the height of the epidemic. He also said: ""Report sick people; report dead bodies; hand-washing. In as much as we were Ebola-free, we didn't let our guard down. We are still applying heightened surveillance, vigilance and testing all sick people and dead bodies.""]4 Apr 2016 Guinea, Liberia: Probe of Ebola flare up in Liberia widens; Woman traveled from Guinea after husband died<http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/4/probe-ebola-flareup-liberia-widens/>[According to the World Health Organization (WHO), on Mon [4 Apr 2016], a 30-year-old woman died from [Ebola virus disease (EVD)].

A new report by the medical caregivers details the clinical course of the 34-year-old American healthcare worker who was admitted to the NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit on day 7 of his illness. The patient survived his illness with intensive supportive care, despite multi-organ failure.Background: Meningoencephalitis has been described as an acute or late complication of Ebola virus disease (EVD) (1-3), but detailed physical examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings have not been previously reported. Here we report findings in a patient with severe EVD complicated by meningoencephalitis and multiorgan failure managed with supportive care only.Case Report: A 34-year-old male health care worker in Sierra Leone was evacuated on day 7 of documented EVD to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

The majority of the funding was originally to be used to address [Ebola virus disease (EVD)].Almost 2 months ago, the Obama administration requested USD 1.9 billion from Congress to respond to the threat ZIKV. According to Shaun Donovon, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who spoke at a press conference: ""Congress has yet to act. In the absence of congressional action, we must scale up Zika preparedness and response activities right now.""Over 600 people with ZIKV, including 64 pregnant women, have been reported in U.S. states and territories. In most cases, people contracted the virus while traveling. However, Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said she expects to see local Zika virus transmission in the continental U.S. in the coming months.
