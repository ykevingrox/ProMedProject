CTV News [edited]<http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/several-hospitalized-at-camp-for-disadvantaged-children-after-outbreak-1.2976161?autoPlay=true>An outbreak of an illness at an Ottawa-area camp for economically disadvantaged kids sent several children to hospital and led to the cancellation of the current camp session.About 120 people are being sent home from Christie Lake Kids camp, located just west of Perth, Ont. Their camp session began 3 Jul [2016] and was to run until 14 Jul [2016]. Camp officials and local health department authorities made the decision after a rash of illnesses broke out among about 20 campers over a 24-hour period.It's not clear what kind of illness the children have or what may have caused it, but camp officials said the kids had developed ""flu-like symptoms"" and that several kids became dehydrated and had to be hospitalized. Those children have returned to the camp and arrangements are being made to get all the children home, starting Wed [6 Jul 2016] with those who are ill and the remainder on Thu [7 Jul 2016], camp spokesperson Natalie Benson told CTV Ottawa.The hope is that the next 2 sessions of the camp can proceed, Benson said. Christie Lake Kids will work to provide other summer experiences for the kids who have to go home. ""We want to make sure that the kids who were here don't miss out. They're extremely disappointed just as much as we are. If you've seen some of the staff's faces they're devastated that the program is going to be cancelled. The kids look very sad and disappointed as well.""According to its website, Christie Lake Kids camp was founded in 1922 and builds ""physical, social and character skills in children facing barriers associated with poverty."" All recreation and camp programs are offered free to eligible families. Children learn swimming, canoeing, ecology and arts and crafts. They play sports and games, go hiking, and set out on overnight and extended canoe trips.[Byline: Katie Griffin]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, is located in the eastern portion of southern Ontario; the great majority of Ontario's population of about 1 million residents and arable land is located in the southern region <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario>.
