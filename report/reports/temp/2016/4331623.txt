By comparison, in 2013, there were 1.3 million deaths from AIDS, 1.4 million from tuberculosis, and 855 000 from malaria, said the report, published in The Lancet.""Whereas deaths from many infectious diseases -- such as TB and malaria -- have dropped since 1990, viral hepatitis deaths have risen,"" said study leader Graham Cooke from Imperial College London's medicine department.Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, most often caused by a virus but sometimes by drug or alcohol abuse, other infections, or autoimmune diseases. Of the 5 types, known as A, B, C, D and E, according to the WHO, types A and E are typically transmitted via contaminated food or water, while B, C and D usually occur from contact with body fluids of an infected person.An estimated 95 percent of people are unaware of their infection, though treating hepatitis B and C can prevent the development of chronic liver disease. 96 percent of hepatitis deaths counted in the review were caused by [chronic infections with] types B and C, said the researchers. Most hepatitis deaths occurred in east and south Asia.""We have tools at our disposal to treat this disease; we have vaccines to hepatitis A and B, and we have new treatments to C, for which there is no vaccine,"" said Cooke. ""However, the price of new medicines [for hepatitis C] is beyond the reach of any country, rich or poor.""The review concluded with a call for a change in funding structures to ""allow effective responses in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This paper underscores how important chronic hepatitis B and C are in the world. A hepatitis B vaccine has been available since 1982, and although no vaccine is yet available for hepatitis C and the current very successful treatments for the virus are extremely expensive, there are more therapies coming, and competition should lower Big Pharma's prices.Stanaway JD, Flaxman AD, Naghavi M, et al: The global burden of viral hepatitis from 1990 to 2013: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Lancet DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30579-7>.""Summary-----------Background:With recent improvements in vaccines and treatments against viral hepatitis, an improved understanding of the burden of viral hepatitis is needed to inform global intervention strategies. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity and mortality for acute viral hepatitis, and for cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by viral hepatitis, by age, sex, and country from 1990 to 2013.Methods:We estimated mortality using natural history models for acute hepatitis infections and GBD's cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver cancer. We used meta-regression to estimate total cirrhosis and total liver cancer prevalence, as well as the proportion of cirrhosis and liver cancer attributable to each cause. We then estimated cause-specific prevalence as the product of the total prevalence and the proportion attributable to a specific cause. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs).Findings:Between 1990 and 2013, global viral hepatitis deaths increased from 0åá89 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0åá86-0åá94) to 1åá45 million (1åá38-1åá54); YLLs from 31åá0 million (29åá6-32åá6) to 41åá6 million (39åá1-44åá7); YLDs from 0åá65 million (0åá45-0åá89) to 0åá87 million (0åá61-1åá18); and DALYs from 31åá7 million (30åá2-33åá3) to 42åá5 million (39åá9-45åá6). In 2013, viral hepatitis was the 7th (95% UI 7th to 8th) leading cause of death worldwide, compared with 10th (10th to 12th) in 1990.Interpretation:Viral hepatitis is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Unlike most communicable diseases, the absolute burden and relative rank of viral hepatitis increased between 1990 and 2013. The enormous health loss attributable to viral hepatitis and the availability of effective vaccines and treatments suggest an important opportunity to improve public health. - Mod.LL]
