This has prompted City Health Officer Dr Rodel Agbulos to look at using the Paseo del Mar Complex to treat the burgeoning number of patients.Health officials are also investigating the source of the virus -- was it originally present in the city or was it brought from other places due to mobility of people. ""As of now the tracing of index cases is on-going,"" said Health Secretary Janette L. Garin who disclosed that she went to Zamboanga City along with experts from Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) and met with chief of hospitals to check the reported rise in cases of diarrhea.Garin also advises the public to be vigilant with their hygiene.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Norovirus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact, and via aerosolization of the virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces. Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, projectile vomiting, malodorous watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever may occur.The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most that contract it make a full recovery within a couple of days. After infection, immunity to norovirus is usually incomplete and temporary. Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semiclosed communities, such as long-term care facilities, overnight camps, hospitals, schools, prisons, dormitories, and cruise ships, where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food. Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by a single infected person.The virus causes approximately 90 percent of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world. - Mod.
