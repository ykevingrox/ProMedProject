Increase in _Neisseria meningitidis_-Associated Urethritis Among Men at Two Sentinel Clinics -- Columbus, Ohio, and Oakland County, Michigan, 2015.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bazan JA, Peterson AS, Kirkcaldy RD, et al. _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) urogenital infections, although less common than infections caused by _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (Ng), have been associated with urethritis, cervicitis, proctitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Nm can appear similar to Ng on Gram stain analysis (gram-negative intracellular diplococci) (1-5). Because Nm colonizes the nasopharynx, men who receive oral sex (fellatio) can acquire urethral Nm infections (1,3,5). This report describes an increase in Nm-associated urethritis in men attending sexual health clinics in Columbus, Ohio, and Oakland County, Michigan.The Columbus and Oakland County clinics are 2 of the sites participating in CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project,* through which urethral isolates from the 1st 25 men evaluated each month with Ng urethritis undergo antibiotic susceptibility testing. At both clinics, staff members obtain urethral swabs from men for Gram stain and culture, and urine for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for Ng. During January-November 2014, Columbus documented no cases of presumed Nm urethritis (i.e., urethral gram-negative intracellular diplococci, growth of oxidase-positive bacterial colonies on modified Thayer-Martin media, and negative urine NAAT for Ng). However, 2 presumed cases occurred in December 2014. During January-September 2015, a total of 52 cases of urethritis were confirmed to be caused by Nm by Analytic Profile Index Neisseria-Haemophilus (API NH) (BioMÌ©rieux) testing and sodC polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using the same criteria, Oakland County had documented 2 cases of Nm urethritis in 2013, 8 cases in 2014, and 15 cases during January-October 2015.52 urethral Nm isolates from Columbus and 12 from Oakland County were sent to CDC for molecular characterization. All Columbus isolates were non-groupable by slide agglutination serogrouping and serogroup specific PCR. Multilocus sequence typing demonstrated that all isolates were ST-11 and part of the CC-11/ET-37 clonal complex. Eleven of the 12 Oakland County isolates exhibited the same genetic profile as the Columbus isolates.Demographic characteristics of the Columbus and Oakland County patients were similar (Table). Median age of the Columbus patients was 30.0 years (interquartile range = 24.5-39.0 years); median age of the Oakland County patients was 29.0 years (interquartile range = 18.0-47.0 years). Among all patients, 99 percent reported heterosexual orientation, and 97 percent had symptomatic urethritis. Oral sex was reported by 100 percent of Columbus patients (data on receipt of fellatio was not available) and 93 percent of Oakland County patients (100 percent received fellatio). Among Columbus patients, 84 percent reported 2 or more sex partners in the preceding 90 days, whereas 56 percent of Oakland County patients reported 2 or more partners in the preceding 60 days. Five Columbus patients reported out of state travel during the preceding 60 days, including to New York, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, and West Virginia. Travel information was unavailable for Oakland County patients. Based on urethral Gram stain results, 90 percent of patients were treated for presumed Ng infection with the CDC-recommended regimen (6), which is also appropriate treatment for Nm urethritis. Vaccination data for the patients were incomplete, but meningococcal vaccination was documented in 5 Columbus patients (received during 2007-2012) and 3 Oakland County patients (received during 2007-2009).Cases of urethritis caused by a clonal strain of Nm (non-groupable, ST-11 and CC-11/ET-37) are occurring among primarily heterosexual men seeking sexual health services in Columbus, Ohio, and Oakland County, Michigan. Because the strain appears to be spreading sexually, increased awareness is warranted. Clinicians should treat Nm urethritis as they would treat Ng urethritis (a single 250-mg dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone plus a single 1-g oral dose of azithromycin) (6). Until more data are available on transmission and sequelae, sex partners of patients with Nm urethritis should be treated as they would be for exposure to urogenital Ng. Increases in Nm urethritis cases above baseline should be reported to CDC via e-mail, nmurethritis@cdc.gov (protected health information should not be sent to this e-mail).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report describes an increased incidence in _Neisseria meningitidis_-associated urethritis in heterosexual men attending sexual disease clinics in Columbus, Ohio, and Oakland County, Michigan. Almost all isolates in this study were non-groupable and multilocus sequence typing demonstrated that all isolates were ST-11 and part of the CC-11/ET-37 clonal complex. Since the basis for grouping meningococci is the antigenic specificity of the organism's polysaccharide capsule, the non-groupable isolates presumably are not encapsulated. Only encapsulated meningococci regularly cause invasive disease. The polysaccharide capsule of _N. meningitidis_ is a major virulence factor; its presence enables this bacterium to overcome host immunity elicited by serum complement, rendering the organism capable of surviving in blood (<http://iai.asm.org/content/80/7/2346.full>). The capsule also inhibits opsonization and engulfment by phagocytic cells._N. meningitidis_ are Gram-negative diplococci, and can be misinterpreted on Gram stained urethral exudates as _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, which are also Gram-negative diplococci. However, in _N. meningitidis_ urethritis, the urine for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for _N. gonorrhoeae_ will be negative.Receipt of oral sex (fellatio) was suspected to be the mode of _N. meningitidis_ transmission in the above report, because the nasopharynx is the natural reservoir for meningococci and non-groupable _N. meningitidis_ are reported to constitute 1/3rd or more of meningococcal isolates recovered from the nasopharynx of human carriers (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/187/10/1616.full.pdf>).Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) with high case fatality rates due to serogroup C meningococci have been reported among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States and Europe in the past several years (see prior ProMED-mail posts below). Another study posted previously by ProMED-mail (Meningitis, meningococcal - Europe: fatal, MSM, new sexually transmitted strain 20160513.4220814) found serogroup C electrophoretic type (ET) 15, cc11 meningococci with the same genotype (C:P1.5-1,10-8:F:3-6:cc11) in isolates from MSM with IMD and in MSM with urethritis/proctitis in Germany and France and all isolates from MSM were able to grow anaerobically and reduce nitrite, unlike meningococcal isolates unrelated to the MSM outbreak. Anaerobic growth, usually rare in meningococci but found in gonococcus, was thought to allow gonococci to survive under anaerobic and acidic pH in the urethra or rectum, leading to the clinical manifestation of urethritis/proctitis as well as the capacity for direct sexual transmission (<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0154047#pone.0154047.s001>). However, strains that were isolated from MSM with IMD were found to have genes that facilitated survival in the blood, unlike strains that remained in the urethra or rectum, causing urethritis and proctitis (<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0154047#pone.0154047.s001>). Oakland County, with a population of about 1.2 million people, is located in the U.S. state of Michigan, within Detroit's metropolitan area (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_County,_Michigan>). Columbus, with a population of about 0.85 million people, is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Ohio (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237>.]
