CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/05/yellow-fever-outbreak-control-stymied-low-vaccine-supply-urban-spread>Coordinated effort is required to boost production and improve stewardship of yellow fever vaccine as mass vaccination campaigns get under way in southern Africa, especially as the risk of outbreaks spurred by travel and vector density remains a global concern, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official said today [10 May 2016].Sylvie Briand, MD, PhD, MPH, director of the WHO's Department of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases, said that, as of yesterday [9 May 2016], yellow fever totals in Angola have reached 2267 suspected and 696 confirmed cases and 292 deaths.Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, Briand said that 41 cases have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), about 90 percent of which were imported from Angola. A separate outbreak is occurring in rural areas of Uganda, and yellow fever cases imported from Angola have been reported in China and Kenya.Challenges facing management of the 3 outbreaks and the WHO's role in stopping transmission include limited capacity to produce yellow fever vaccine and the likelihood that supplies will soon be exhausted, ongoing transmission of the disease in urban settings, and inconsistent enforcement of vaccination among travelers to and from southern Africa.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is curious that there is no discussion about approaches for control, given the limited vaccine supplies. Vaccination is the only feasible way that transmission will be halted. One hopes that alternatives such as reduced dose volume are being considered currently and not waiting until no more yellow fever (YF) vaccine is available. - Mod.TY]******[2] EU responseDate: Thu 12 May 2016Source: EurActiv [edited]<http://www.euractiv.com/section/development-policy/news/eu-sends-new-medical-corps-team-to-angola-yellow-fever-outbreak/>The EU is to send its new European Medical Corps on its 1st ever mission -- to help tackle the outbreak of yellow fever in the West African state of Angola.Since the 1st case was reported in the capital, Luanda, in December 2015, 260 have died, amid some 2000 reported cases.The European Medical Corps (EMC) was founded in February this year [2016] to deal with medical emergencies in the wake of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and this will be its 1st deployment.Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, said, ""We have learned the lessons from the Ebola crisis.""Today, we are deploying a 1st team of public health experts as part of the European Medical Corps. They will complement the efforts of the Angolan government and work closely with the World Health Organisation and other international partners on the ground to deal with the yellow fever outbreak. Together we can understand it better and stop it faster,"" he said.The Angola yellow fever team consists of experts from Germany, Portugal and Belgium.According to DG ECHO, the 2-week mission will see the EMC team investigate the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, assess the risk of it spreading further, including outside Angola, look at the implications for European travellers in Angola and returning to the EU, and help local doctors.Some of Angola's cases are believed to have spread to China, Kenya, DR Congo and Mauritania.Yellow fever strikes with initial symptoms of back ache, muscle pain, fever, headache, shivering and is transmitted by mosquitos. It is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease, which has no cure, although there is a vaccination.Angola has suffered previous outbreaks in 1971 and 1988, whilst much of sub-Saharan Africa suggests yellow fever vaccinations for visitors.So far around 6 million Angolans have been vaccinated, according to the World Health Organisation, out of a population of 24 million.The EMC was set up in the wake of the West Africa Ebola crisis, which saw some 11 000 die of the disease. It has ready-to-deploy teams from 9 EU member states -- Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands, Finland, and Sweden. It is part of the European Emergency Response Capacity, under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.American doctors, writing in the Journal of American Medical Association, have warned it could become a global crisis due to a lack of vaccines, which take 6 months to produce.[Byline: Matthew Tempest]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is good to see this type of international response to Angola's YF outbreak. One hopes that during the 2-week deployment, the EMC (European Medical Corps) can put a solid surveillance system in place that is connected to good laboratory support. Given the looming vaccine shortage, a proactive epidemiological effort can help to prioritize those areas most in need of vaccine coverage, as well as identify ""hot spots"" of transmission around the country. ProMED awaits reports of the EMC experience with considerable interest.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY]
