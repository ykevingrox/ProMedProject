WITN [edited]<http://www.witn.com/content/news/State-warning-people-to-avoid-algae-blooms-in-Pamlico-River-and-tributaries-391034762.html>The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality says the blooms are now showing up in several places in Beaufort County, including the Pamlico, Swan Point, Pantego Creek, Bath Creek, Back Creek, Goose Creek, Duck Creek, Yeats Creek, Runyon Creek, Chocowinity Bay, Broad Creek, Moores Beach, and Washington Park. Algae blooms have also been observed at the headwaters of Bay River and Trent Creek in Pamlico County.The state says blue-green algae has been spotted, which can produce cyanotoxins. Those blooms can cause illness in people and pets.Already, thousands of dead fish have been reported in the Pamlico. The Pamlico-Tar riverkeeper says the kill is likely due that some of the algae bloom last week [15-21 Aug 2016], causing low oxygen conditions in the river.Experts say while it is safe to boat and fish in the waters, the Division of Public Health says people should avoid contact, and prevent children and pets from swimming in or ingesting water in an algae bloom.The state says you should not handle or cook dead fish in the area.The Department of Environmental Quality says so far they've had no reports of health problems with people associated with this algae bloom.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are ubiquitous, particularly in the ocean, where given certain environmental conditions they proliferate exponentially, producing blooms. Blooming cyanobacteria can produce cyanotoxins that are toxic to animals (including humans).Cyanobacteria are a phylum of photosynthetic bacteria (they are not true algae) and they produce high concentrations of cyanotoxins at some algal blooms, which are then called 'harmful algal blooms'. Cyanotoxins usually target the nervous system (neurotoxins), the liver (hepatotoxins) or the skin (dermatoxins). The chemical structure of cyanotoxins falls into 3 broad groups: cyclic peptides, alkaloids and lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins). - Mod.PMBThe state of North Carolina can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/235>.
