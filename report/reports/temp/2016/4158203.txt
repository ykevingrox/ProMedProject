The death of a man, 2 of his wives and his daughter were announced by Guinean health authorities 2 weeks ago. On Wed [6 Apr 2016] they confirmed that a 3rd wife and a mother-in-law also died after becoming infected in the village of Korokpara [Guinea]. According to Fode Tass Sylla, spokesperson for Guinea's Ebola response unit, ""On [30 Mar 2016], there are 9 registered cases and 7 deaths: 3 suspected and 4 confirmed."" Outside the family, a man died on 22 Mar [2016] after testing positive for EVD in the city of N'Zerekore. Sylla further disclosed that 2 more people, one suspected case and one confirmed, were receiving treatment at a dedicated EVD facility in southern Guinea, not far from the border with Liberia. More than 1000 people who are believed to have come into contact with the victims are being monitored for symptoms and offered support by the authorities, with restrictions placed on their movements.][This outbreak in Guinea, while worrisome, appears to be contained, which is great news, but there are probably cases occurring that have not been recognized. Therefore, it is important to maintain vigilant surveillance. - Mod.LK]11 Apr 2016 Liberia: Two Ebola-infected boys in Liberia respond to ZMapp treatment<http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/two-ebola-infected-boys-in-liberia-respond-to-zmapp-treatment/vi-BBrDaOs>[Liberian health authorities are reporting the ZMapp drugs have so far been effective in treating 2 boys infected with Ebola virus disease (EVD), whose mother died on [31 Mar 2016].

However, other contacts under observation are resisting vaccination for unknown reasons. He said 10 of those under surveillance will shortly be discharged after completing their 2l days observation. The other contacts are also doing well and have shown no sign of Ebola virus disease.13 Apr 2016 Mali: Mali authorities seek 2 Guineans who had Ebola contact<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_MALI_EBOLA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-04-13-09-14-52>[According to Dr. Keni Diarra, head doctor at the health center in Kenieba in the Kayes region, a search is underway for 2 women who left Guinea after having had contact with a recent [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] case.

""A year on from the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreaks in West Africa, many Ebola survivors are now suffering symptoms of post-Ebola syndrome (PES), including vision complications, joint and muscle pain and psychiatric and neurological problems. To find out more about the broad-ranging symptoms of PES, a clinical team led by Dr Janet Scott and Dr Calum Semple, from the University's Institute of Translational Medicine, assessed survivors discharged from the Ebola Treatment Unit at the 34th Regiment Military Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone."" Dr Scott said: ""There are over 17 000 survivors from the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, including around 5000 in Sierra Leone. This provides us with a new opportunity to better understand these debilitating post-viral symptoms and improve ongoing care for patients. To better understand the neurological and psychiatric effects of PES, adult patients with predetermined, significant symptoms such as confusion, depression and psychosis, were identified from the patient notes of over 300 EVD survivors.""""Selected patients were invited to attend a joint neuropsychiatric clinic where they underwent a full neurological examination, psychiatric screening and specialist investigations including brain scan imaging.""Dr Patrick Howlett, from the King's Sierra Leone Partnership, said: 'We found a broad set of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, from minor to extremely severe, are present in Ebola survivors well over a year after discharge from hospital. In our selected group intermittent headaches were the most frequent neurological feature, with a variety of associated symptoms.'""Psychiatrist Dr Stephen Sevalie from the 34th Regiment Military Hospital, added: 'Psychiatric features of insomnia, depression and anxiety are common and our findings suggest that there is a need for primary level neurological and psychiatric referral.'""The ophthalmology aspect of the study, led by Dr Paul Steptoe, examined 150 Ebola survivors with vision complaints. The patients underwent a number of ophthalmic assessments including a slit lamp examination to microscopically examine the eye in detail for any abnormalities.""The findings reveal a more diverse range of eye complications in PES than previously reported, including cases of cataracts in young survivors.""Dr Scott added: ""Post-Ebola syndrome is not going away, and we are seeing people now, 2 years later, still suffering from the after effects of this terrible disease. - ...more][Submitted by: Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>]Vaccine-----12 Apr 2016: Can great apes be vaccinated against Ebola and other diseases?<http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-are-trying-vaccinate-great-apes-against-ebola-and-other-diseases-180958725/#BJ3VHkh4YPvFPUyz.99>[According to some conservationists, vaccinating great apes against diseases like the Ebola virus might be the quickest and most effective short-term step towards saving them from extinction.Over the last 20 years, the wild populations of many of the world's great apes have drastically declined. Recent surveys have suggested that several species of large primates, including chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas, have experienced severe losses in population numbers. Despite efforts by conservationists working with governments to create nature reserves and sanctuaries where primates are protected from poachers and habitat loss, the spread of diseases can have a large impact on struggling great ape populations.According to a new report by the Wildlife Conservation Society, Flora and Fauna International, and the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature, the eastern lowland gorilla population alone has plummeted from 17 000 in 1995 to about 3800, Dominique Bonessi reports for the PBS Newshour.But while war, poaching and habitat loss are some of the worst human-related causes blamed for the population drop, diseases like [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] have killed tens of thousands of great apes in recent years.According to Peter Walsh, a primate ecologist at Cambridge University, ""I did a survey of the impact of Ebola over the past 20 years and found that about a 3rd of the world's gorillas were wiped out by the disease. The key point is the disease, which was probably spread by bats, killed gorillas and chimps in remote strongholds where we thought they were safe.""Over the last few decades since the Ebola virus was discovered, researchers believe that the virus may have killed almost [1/3rd] of the world's wild gorillas and chimpanzees. Since the late 1990s, biologists have attributed several large die-offs of great apes in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to Ebola outbreaks, Caleb Hellerman reported for The Atlantic in 2015.Citation: Plumptre AJ, Nixon S, Critchlos R.

When we went great ape tracking (gorillas and chimps) in Uganda last November (2015), we were kept 7 meters away -- and nobody was coughing -- so impossible to spread a respiratory virus. Why do they assume the entire decline in great ape numbers is due to Ebola? They must have malaria and intestinal diseases, heart attacks and stroke just like humans. - Mod.JW][But it may not be tourists who are suspected of infecting the great apes, but rather the apes may become infected (from bats?) and inadvertently pass on the infection to other apes. - Mod.LK]12 Apr 2016: Vaccines for Ebola: tackling a market failure<https://audioboom.com/boos/4419861-vaccines-for-ebola-tackling-a-market-failure>""A market failure has prevented the development of vaccines against Ebola, MERS and other viruses. Ironically, emerging data suggest these vaccines might be quite straightforward to develop to licensure."" Big Pharma can't make money is the problem according to Adrian Hill, Director, Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford in a Oxford London lecture, 2016. ""[Dr. Hill] discusses the dilemma that faced public health officials, vaccine companies and academic vaccine developers in late 2014 and the remarkable rapid response that ensued. At least 3 vaccines were developed clinically in months rather than years, and one of these contributed to ending the [Ebola] outbreak. But all of these vaccines had initially been financed by North American biodefence programmes, not to prevent outbreaks in Africa. Ironically, emerging data suggest that vaccines against Ebola, MERS and many other outbreak pathogens might be quite straightforward to develop to licensure, but this has not happened. ...more][An interesting podcast at the URL above discusses the pros and cons of potential solutions to the market problem that have been proposed to provide vaccine stockpiles or to undertake large scale prevention vaccination against future outbreaks. - Mod.LKFunding-----12 Apr 2016: World Bank mobilizes USD one billion for Ebola-struck MRU member states<http://en.starafrica.com/news/world-bank-mobilizes-us1bn-for-ebola-struck-mru-member-states.html>[According to a World Bank Davos report, the World Bank has mobilized nearly USD one billion in financing for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the 3 Mano River Union (MRU) member countries hardest hit by the Ebola crisis, a World Bank Davos report has said.According to the report released Mon [11 Apr 2016], the funding includes USD 18 million from the International Development Association (IDA) and at least USD 450 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), financing arm of the World Bank.The report stated that the money is intended for epidemic response as well as to stimulate trade, investment and employment in the 3 MRU countries.
