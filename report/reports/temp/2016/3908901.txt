Premium Times [edited]<http://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/196098-taraba-government-confirms-lassa-fever-outbreak.html>The Taraba State Government has confirmed the outbreak of Lassa fever in the state.The Commissioner of Health, Innocent Vakkai, who confirmed the outbreak said, ""2 persons died and 2 others were quarantined; their blood samples have already been taken to Irrua Specialists' Hospital in Edo State for further confirmation.""While addressing journalists on Fri 1 Jan 2016, Mr. Vakkai advised the public not to panic as the state government had responded swiftly to the outbreak. He also elaborated on how the fever spreads. ""People usually get infected with the Lassa Virus after exposure to infected rodents, while person-to-person transmission occurs through direct contact with the sick person,"" the commissioner said.He called on the residents to avoid contact with rats especially in the areas where the outbreak occurred. ""Other precautionary measures include putting food in rodent-proof containers and wearing protections such as masks, gloves, gowns among others [when dealing with infected patients],"" he added.Mr. Vakkai further called on residents to report to the nearest hospital any case of nasal bleeding, as well as bleeding through the anus and mouth, which he said are among the symptoms of the disease.It could be recalled that a Lassa Fever outbreak occurred in Taraba in February 2012, causing the death of 10 people including a doctor and 2 nurses who attended to the patients.[Byline: Mohammed Mustapha]--Communicated by:Muktar Gadanya <gadanya@gmail.com>[The latest Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health Bulletin No. 5 (44) issued on 6 Nov 2015 indicated that Lassa fever cases were reported in 12 states in Nigeria in 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151125.3819446). That official report listed 4 cases in Taraba state in 2015. The above mentions a single case with an additional 2 suspected cases. It is not clear whether these cases occurred after the 6 Nov 2015 report or are new cases, as seems likely. As noted in the comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150228.3199551: ""Lassa fever virus [LFV] is endemic in Nigeria, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country.""LFV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with an infected individual's viremic blood in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Several cases of transmission have occurred in hospitals. Fortunately, there were no cases among the Kano AKTH staff in the previous ProMED-mail report.As the late Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived posting 20130131.1524034: ""In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multisystem disease. Rarely, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients.""The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the reservoir rodent host. In the absence of adequate infection control measures, person-to-person virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments, or in laboratories testing samples from patients.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.A map of Nigeria can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/620>.]
