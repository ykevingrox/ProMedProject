They will remain classified as probable cases until a full battery of tests has been run to determine other possible causes of illness. Once the final results are received the cases will be reclassified. Coincidentally, a previously scheduled pre-emptive vaccination campaign is ongoing in Kwanza Sul province where 2 new probable cases were reported.Epidemiological situationAngola2 new probable cases without a history of yellow fever vaccination were reported from Kwanza Sul province in the last week.Of the 45 probable cases that were reported in the 4 weeks to 13 Oct [2016]: 31 have been discarded, 2 are undergoing further testing and 12 await classification by the committee (Fig. 1).From 5 Dec 2015 - 20 Oct 2016 (Table 1):- 4347 suspected cases, with 377 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 8.7 percent);- 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 percent).Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces (Table 2). Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces.Democratic Republic of the CongoFrom 1 Jan - 26 Oct 2016 (Fig. 2, Table 1):- 2987 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces;- 78 confirmed cases have been identified from 2800 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 percent);- Of the 78 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces (Fig. 4), 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous, and 8 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak).- One new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Bominenge Health Zone in Sud Ubangui province. This was one of the 16 probable cases that were reported under investigation last week. This new sylvatic case reportedly had symptom onset on 17 Aug [2016]14 probable cases remain under investigation (3 in Kinshasa, 8 in Kwango and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, and Lualaba provinces). In addition to the case in Sud Ubangui that was under investigation and is now classified as a new sylvatic case, one case in Kinshasa was ruled out due to previous yellow fever vaccination history.ResponseInformation on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website.In Angola, phase 2 of the vaccination campaign targeting more than 2 million people in 12 districts in 10 provinces is ongoing.In Democratic Republic of the Congo, the reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi Health Zone in Kwango province ended after 152 492 people were vaccinated among a target of 146 449 (104.1 percent). The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province which began on 20 Oct [2016] is ongoing. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted in August [2016].WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda since the beginning of the outbreak through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile, with additional vaccine doses from the manufacturer Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.As of 25 Oct 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for Democratic Republic of the Congo (Table 3).The number of vaccine doses currently available in the ICG global stockpile for emergency response is 6.9 million (Table 4). The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is good to learn that 31 of the 45 probable cases in Angola and 1 of the 16 probable cases in the DR Congo have been confirmed, the latter as a sylvatic case. The remaining 14 and 15 cases need to be confirmed or discarded, as do the 2 new probable cases in Kwanza Sul province, Angola. If these 2 cases are confirmed, it indicates that local transmission continues and vaccination in those areas is essential to keep transmission from spreading.A series of graphs, tables and map are not shown but are available in the original document at the above URL. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>]
