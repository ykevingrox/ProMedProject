Albuquerque Journal [edited]<https://www.abqjournal.com/837446/abq-area-man-diagnosed-with-plague.html>Albuquerque area man diagnosed with plague------------------------------------------A Bernalillo County man, 67, has been diagnosed with New Mexico's 3rd case in 2016 of plague, which he likely contracted from the bite from a wild prairie dog in Santa Fe County, health officials announced. The man had been hospitalized but is now recovering at home, the New Mexico Department of Health said.Plague is a bacterial disease that cycles between rodents and fleas. People usually get the disease from the bites of infected fleas, but it can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents and pets.""Avoiding interaction of any kind with wild animals, especially animals that may be sick, is one way to reduce your risk of contracting plague,"" health secretary Lynn Gallagher said. Health officials warn pet owners to prevent dogs and cats from roaming and to speak with a veterinarian about appropriate flea protection.[byline: Olivier Uyttebrouck]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in this case are not stated in the report but it is likely to have been bubonic plague.2015 was a ""banner year"" for _Y. pestis_ infections in the USA with 15 cases and 4 deaths. In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 1-17 cases per year) with 0-2 deaths.The following was extracted from: Prentice MB, Rahalison L. Plague. Lancet. 2007; 369(9568): 1196-207, with the citations removed:""Some plague cases (10-25 per cent) present with primary septicemia (hypotension, shock) without lymph nodes being obviously affected and these patients have higher mortality than those with bubonic plague. The term septicemic plague can be confusing, since most patients with buboes have detectable bacteremia at some stage and can also have high-density bacteremia with systemic signs of sepsis. Debate about whether septicemic plague is always secondary to frank or subclinical bubonic or pneumonic disease continues, but work in mice lends support to the existence of a syndrome of septicemic disease without histological changes in lymph nodes in a few animals infected by flea bites."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1843>.]
