So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The global tally reported to WHO as of 11 Sep 2016 is 1806 cases of laboratory-confirmed infection with MERS-CoV including 643 deaths. Since then Saudi Arabia has reported 3 additional cases. As the previously available WHO tally was 1800 cases, this tally of 1806 presumably includes the case in a Saudi camel herder reported by Austria on 8 Sep 2016.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
