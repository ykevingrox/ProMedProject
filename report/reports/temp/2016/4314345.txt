Dying as quickly as this victim did would suggest that he had a heart attack -- tragic, but everyday.We still don't know what the butchered cow died of, but as no human cases of anthrax have been reported in relation to the meat distributed by boda-boda, we might assume for the present that she did not die of anthrax.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[See Also:Anthrax - Kenya (03): (KB) human, bovine, susp, RFI 20160627.4312495Anthrax - Kenya (02): (MU) human, bovine 20160511.4215926Anthrax - Kenya: foiled anthrax attack, susp ISIS 20160504.42021462015----Anthrax - Kenya: (KB) human, bovine 20150326.3257253].................................................mhj/mj/jw"
