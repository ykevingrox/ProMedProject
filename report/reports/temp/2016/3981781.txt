The 1st-time mother remains in Wollongong Hospital after giving birth to her daughter on Tuesday, 26 Jan 2016, 5 weeks before her due date. She and her husband had traveled to Sylvania, in Sydney's south, for a birthing class at the weekend when they stopped at Box Village Bakery and Cafe for lunch about 1pm. Both she and her husband ate hot chicken rolls with gravy, she told the Illawarra Mercury from her hospital bed.By 8pm, she was violently ill with intense cramping, vomiting and diarrhea. Her husband drove her to Shellharbour Hospital about 1am on Mon, 25 Jan 2016. By then, he too was experiencing some of the same symptoms. She was transferred to Wollongong Hospital, where doctors kept watch on her falling blood pressure and worsening loss of fluids. Doctors decided to operate when the unborn baby's movements slowed.The baby ultimately arrived at 35 weeks and 6 days, weighing a healthy 2.9 kilograms. Doctors told the family a younger baby of a lesser weight might not have withstood the stresses of food poisoning. The mother told 2UE she could not see her daughter for the 1st 24 hours as she was in ICU. She said her daughter was healthy and doing well, and for that she felt blessed.The NSW Food Authority shut down the bakery this week after more than 150 people presented themselves at St George and Sutherland hospitals with symptoms of food poisoning. Tests confirmed that salmonella bacteria had been found in some of the patients who had eaten at the bakery.Professor Mark Ferson, the director of the Public Health Unit at the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District, said the sick patients ranged in age from young children to the elderly. ""They've presented with diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, fever, aches and pains, and we have some positive salmonella results on early tests on some of those people,"" he said. ""Salmonellosis can be mild, but can be very nasty. People can get dehydrated and quite sick with salmonella.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In a majority of outbreaks of salmonellosis related to bakeries, the source of the pathogen is related to eggs. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/284>.]
