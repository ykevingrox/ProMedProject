ith Ring Vaccination. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.<http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005093>.Abstract.- Interim results from the Guinea Ebola ring vaccination trial suggest high efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. These findings open the door to the use of ring vaccination strategies in which the contacts and contacts of contacts of each index case are promptly vaccinated to contain future Ebola virus disease outbreaks. To provide a numerical estimate of the effectiveness of ring vaccination strategies, we introduce a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate Ebola outbreaks in the Pujehun district, Sierra Leone, structurally similar to previous modelling approaches. We find that ring vaccination can successfully contain an outbreak for values of the effective reproduction number up to 1.6. Through an extensive sensitivity analysis of parameters characterising the readiness and capacity of the health care system, we identify interventions that, alongside ring vaccination, could increase the likelihood of containment. In particular, shortening the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation to 2-3 days on average through improved contact tracing procedures, adding a 2-km spatial component to the vaccination ring, and decreasing human mobility by quarantining affected areas might contribute to increasing our ability to contain outbreaks with effective reproduction numbers of up to 2.6. These results have implications for future control of Ebola and other emerging infectious disease threats.]To read the publication, see <http://bit.ly/2f19r18>.]30 Oct 2016 Sierra Leone: Ebola vaccine shows promise in STRIVE trial<http://www.vaccineconfidence.org/sierra-leone-ebola-vaccine-shows-promise-in-strive-trial/>An investigational Ebola vaccine administered to health care professionals and response workers in Sierra Leone was not associated with serious adverse events, according to preliminary phase II/III results from the STRIVE trial.According to Susan Goldstein, MD of CDC's [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and colleagues, 8638 adult participants in 5 districts in Sierra Leone were enrolled from April to August 2015. The participants were randomly assigned to receive the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (Merck) within 7 days of enrollment or within 18 to 24 weeks of enrollment. Initially, the researchers considered a stepped wedge trial design with sequential group vaccination but opted to conduct phased enrollment to increase the chances of determining vaccine efficacy if the outbreak waned and to be able to vaccinate participants earlier and increase the sample size.The participants were assessed for the incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and serious adverse events 6 months after vaccination or enrollment. Goldstein and colleagues planned to determine vaccine efficacy based on EVD incidence in the vaccinated and deferred (unvaccinated) groups.According to the data, there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events or deaths among vaccinated participants (n=8016). The safety profile of the vaccine was similar to that of other published studies, Goldstein said at IDWeek 2016. 72 participants were evaluated by PCR, and all tested negative for EVD. However, because no EVD cases occurred, vaccine efficacy could not be determined.In September 2015, an Ebola case was reported within one of the STRIVE study districts. Consequently, the researchers administered the vaccine to about 100 unvaccinated participants. No other EVD infections were detected in the region; however, the researchers were not able to determine whether early vaccination contributed to prevention of additional cases.Goldstein said: ""As our study comes to an end, we recognize that STRIVE was much bigger than a clinical trial. Yes, we rapidly implemented a clinical trial with over 8000 people and collected important safety and immunogenicity data that will be used for vaccine licensure, but we also built capacity. We trained over 350 Sierra Leonean staff, developed a clinical trials platform, and enhanced research and response capacity that we hope left the country better positioned to continue this work going forward.""Citation.

According to Samuel Oti of the International Development Research Center, once the vaccine is rolled out, priority will go to countries that have had Ebola outbreaks recently and their neighboring countries.Development of the Ebola Vaccine has been done by the Public Health Agency of Canada, and it has taken the agency about 14 years to complete development of the vaccine according to the Head of Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapy.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail HealthMaps:Liberia: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>]
