Times of India, Times News Network (TNN) [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/247-fall-ill-after-eating-meal-at-Maharashtra-school/articleshow/51142712.cms>A total of 247 students of a zilla parishad [district council] school in Vikramgad [town] of Palghar district [Maharashtra] fell ill after they consumed lunch in the school on [Thu 25 Feb 2016]. The condition of 17 students is said to be unstable.The students of the school in Kasa Budruk village in Vikramgad were served 'khichdi' (a mixture of rice and dal [lentils]) by Isckon [International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a religious organisation] at around 1.45 pm. Students of classes I to VII had their lunch in the school premises and left for their classrooms.Within half an hour, around 50 students of various classes complained of stomachache, vomiting, and giddiness. Their teachers took them to the Talvad primary health centre where doctors suspected food poisoning.By evening, almost all the students complained of stomachache following which all of them have been admitted to the district hospital in Vikramgad. A student said, ""I felt uneasy while I was eating the khichdi, but decided to finish it. It was a while later that I experienced severe stomachache.""Isckon has been providing lunch, mostly in the form of khichdi, to the students of the schools since several years. The Kasa police station has registered a case. District health officials reached the school and seized the food. Samples of the food have been sent for testing.[Byline: Sandhya Nair]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[With an incubation period of as short as 30 minutes, the possible etiology of the illness here is quite limited.It is likely that laboratory testing will show a food item to be contaminated with high levels of _Staphylococcus aureus_. Food can become contaminated if a person with a staph infection has an uncovered lesion or sore that comes in contact with food or food processing equipment. _S. aureus_ bacteria and toxin can contaminate foods or equipment. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are fast acting, sometimes causing illness in as little as 30 minutes but usually in 4-6 hours, with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and little if any fever. The patients usually recover within a day.A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than 1 hour) also suggests that the etiology was heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. - Mod.LLMaps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2250>.
