The Nation [edited]<http://nation.com.pk/newspaper-picks/15-Feb-2016/leishmaniasis-disease-soaring-in-landi-kotal>[Cutaneous] leishmaniasis disease is soaring in tehsil [sub-district] Landi Kotal [in Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas/FATA], and hundreds of local patients including children are repeatedly visiting Agency Headquarters hospital for treatment.However, they complained about unavailability of leishmaniasis injections, health and local sources said on [Sun 14 Feb 2016]. As per health experts, the disease spread because of biting of sandflies, breeding in fresh water.Hundreds of patients including women, children from almost all areas, including Zakha Khel, Pasad Khel, Khuga Khel, Kam-Shelman, Loy-Shelman, the far-flung areas of tehsil Landi Kotal have got the infection, [according to] health officials.Rehmatullah in-charge of laboratory in the hospital, said 10-15 cases were being diagnosed with leishmaniasis on a daily basis in addition [to those being treated] in private clinics. He further said the number of patients would increase as the weather would turn warm, which is favourable for breeding of the sandflies.A resident of Zakha Khel said, presently 3 of his children got the disease and more than 15 patients have been treated. He further said that the disease was spreading speedily in the area and every house had 2 or 3 affected persons.When the medical superintendent (MS) of Landi Kotal hospital, Dr Nazir Wazir, was contacted he said that the FATA health directorate has supplied 300 injections from December last year [2015] till Feb 2016, however the number of the patients recorded in the recent year are 188 beside, hundreds of others have been registered last year [2015].He further said that one patient needs a minimum of 20 injections to be treated, therefore huge quantity of doses is necessary to cure the disease.The tribesmen demanded of the health department provision of free injections to the hospital for early treatment of the patients and stressed upon the concerned authorities to carry out fumigation spray in the whole area to wipe out the disease.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis (CL and VL) are endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
