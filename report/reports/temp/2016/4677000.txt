Grande FM [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.grandefm.com.br/noticias/saude/mais-uma-cidade-registra-morte-de-macacos-com-febre-amarela-em-sp>A city in SÌ£o Paulo state registered monkey deaths from yellow fever, which expands the alert about the risk that the disease will spread. In Jaboticabal (342 km [213 mi] from SÌ£o Paulo city), 2 animals died, victims of the disease, which caused the prefecture to create a day for massive vaccination of residents who are not immunized against the disease.There have been cases of yellow fever registered earlier in rural and urban areas in RibeirÌ£o Preto and in cities in the SÌ£o JosÌ© do Rio Preto region.Through her advice, the coordinator of the Jaboticabal Vectors and Zoonoses Surveillance, Maura Guedes Barreto, said that due to confirmation of the cases in RibeirÌ£o Preto -- cities 60 km [37 mi] distant, yellow fever was already a theme of discussion in the municipality before that was discovered in the dead monkeys.[17 Dec 2016] was set as the date for mass vaccination for those in Jaboticabal who are not immunized. Until then, however, the health posts in the city will serve the patients from Monday to Friday.The appearance of cases of yellow fever in the interior of SÌ£o Paulo caused municipalities to anticipate vaccination in infants, in addition to developing actions to avoid the risk of disease spread. In the SÌ£o JosÌ© do Rio Preto, the deaths of at least 4 monkeys from the disease were confirmed and a man died, victim of the sylvatic [forest] form of yellow fever.In RibeirÌ£o Preto, a marmoset died in the city central square and the prefecture increased vaccination with mobile posts and [health centers] open on the weekends, in order to try to attract an estimated 100 000 people who are not vaccinated.Although the total of [monkey] deaths are sufficient to generate an alert in health services, the number could be much more. In the Rio Preto region, there are another 4 animals that await results of tests and the number of reports this year [2016] is of finding bodies or bones of monkeys which already exceeds 40. Also, there are cases being investigated RibeirÌ£o.--Communicated byKathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Kathryn Soderholm for sending in the report above.The report indicates that there is sylvan (forest) yellow fever (YF) virus circulating in another locality in SÌ£o Paulo state. Other than the single human case cited above, there have been no reported human cases. The comments of Mod.RNA in 2 previous reports of this sylvan outbreak of yellow fever are instructive.A 1 Dec 2016 report posted in ProMED-PORT (in Portuguese) indicated that the dead monkeys were howlers, a species commonly involved in the sylvan cycle of YF virus transmission, and indicators of the presence of virus in the area.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10831>. - Mod.TY]
