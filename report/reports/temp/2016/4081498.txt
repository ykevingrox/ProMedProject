""With funds from the Department of International Development (DFID), we have rehabilitated the centre and the outpatient edifice with extra facilities that are 1st of its kind in Sierra Leone,"" he said, adding that a resuscitation machine and oxygen inhaler to help unconscious patients were made available in the hospital for the 1st time. He pleaded with the public to be making the best out of the facility regardless of the paucity of doctors at the unit. He mentioned lack of maintenance as one of the challenges facing the unit, adding that they would facilitate a training of specialist doctors to man the facility. Meanwhile, Concord Times discovered that the centre has been abandoned because doctors are fearful of contracting the Ebola virus disease there. ... - more[Byline: Patrick Jaiah Kamara]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[If the doctors are afraid, no wonder patients are afraid of going there. - Mod.JW]******[2] Opinion: herd immunityDate: Mon 7 Mar 2016Source: Science Magazine [edited]<http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/qa-scott-halstead-zika-will-subside-5-years-max>Q&A with Scott Halstead-----------------------[excerpt]Q: Chikungunya 1st surfaced in the Caribbean in modern times in 2013. How long do you think it is going to stay around?A: 5 years, max. The only model I have is India. I watched when chikungunya went from Africa to India in 1963 and it disappeared from India in about 5 years.Q: Zika?A: Zika's the same.Q: There's a big rush to make vaccines against chikungunya and Zika because there's fear. But for Brazil, for example, by the time there's a vaccine, you're suggesting the country's population may well be largely immune to Zika.A: Exactly. It's like Ebola. It will be gone. We're going to have this Ebola vaccine, which is about 85 percent done, and it will sit there until the next outbreak.There are a lot of people saying there's going to be Zika and chikungunya in these new places forever. I just don't think so. Based on the observations that I've made and that anybody can see with their own eyes if they look at the data, this virus is just going to burn itself out. There's only a need for a vaccine in the acute emergency. ... - more[Byline: Jon Cohen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Scott, now 86, is one of the world's foremost authorities on viruses spread by mosquitoes, including dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and chikungunya. I agree with him. When a population survey is done in the West African Ebola hotspots, I'm willing to bet we will find that a large proportion of the local people are immune from asymptomatic or otherwise unrecognized Ebola infection, and the epidemic has simply burned out. This is not to belittle the advances in therapy with resulting lowered death rate bought by the billions of dollars of international aid spent there and elsewhere, or the production of vaccines. I just hope it will be possible to freeze-dry Ebola vaccine in bulk to extend its shelf life, lower storage costs and allow reconstitution in the field as required. - Mod.JW]******[3] USA: possible new drugDate: Tue 8 Mar 2016 Source: BioCryst Pharmaceuticals [edited]<http://www.journaltranscript.com/2016/03/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-tests-zika-drug-on-mice-gets-positive-results>BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. tests Zika drug on mice, gets positive results[7/8 mice that received BCX443 survived; no other mice that were given ribavirin or placebo survived for more than 28 days.
