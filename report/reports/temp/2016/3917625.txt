AllAfrica, Al Jazeera (Doha) report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201601041161.html>In a remote northwest corner of South Sudan, [a 35-year-old woman from the village of Adiang is in a hurry. She walked for 1.5 hours] before managing to flag down a truck to drive her and her sick son another hour to the hospital.Her son is 2.5 years old and has malaria. She gave him some anti-malarial medication at home but it didn't help. He then started convulsing and she knew it was time to make the journey into Aweil [Northern Bahr el Ghazal state].The city of Aweil is a patchwork of red dirt roads leading to a bustling town centre that has been a pocket of peace in a conflict ridden country for the past 2 years.It hosts a base for the United Nations Mission to South Sudan, a number of aid agencies, and is home to the sole functioning public hospital with the only blood bank in the entire state of Northern Bahr el Ghazal.A large section of the hospital is run by Doctors Without Borders in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and serves about 1.2 million people in what is South Sudan's poorest state.Once [the woman] and her son arrive, he is taken into the ward and treated. ""I like the level of care here,"" she says. ""There has been a lot more malaria in my village this year [2015] than last year [2014].""Malaria is endemic to South Sudan and is the leading cause of death and illness but this year [?2016] Doctors Without Borders say the malaria outbreak is shaping up to be the most severe it has seen. While the United Nations has described it as ""unprecedented"".[Byline: Caitlin McGee]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the WHO World Malaria Report 2015 (<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/wmr2015-profiles.pdf>), 75 percent of the population is covered by either insecticide treated nets (ITNs) or insecticide residual spraying (IRS). Due to the prolonged civil unrest these figures are probably an overestimation.In 2013 (latest year data was reported) South Sudan reported 12 deaths due to malaria nationwide, most probably a gross underestimation. The present surge in malaria in an endemic region is probably due to failure in the control program with lack of ITN and IRS coverage, lack of available treatment in the periphery, and probably substandard drugs. - Mod.EPMore information on current estimated numbers of cases and deaths due to malaria in South Sudan would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPPMaps of South Sudan can be seen at <http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Pages%20from%20map_0.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/27328>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
