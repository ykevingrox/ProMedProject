Its goal of wiping out the disease from the planet, which was meant to happen in 2000, is about 16 years overdue -- but getting close. The campaign has confined the disease to only 3 countries and hopes to reach its goal by the end of this decade.Now, however, the fight faces a new threat: a critical shortage of vaccine.The campaign -- conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UNICEF, Rotary International and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -- was expecting to receive 110 million doses of injectable polio vaccine (IPV) this year [2016], but the 2 manufacturers have told the groups they can supply only about half that. ""We don't have specifics, but something is preventing the scale-up of vaccination production,"" says Shanelle Hall, director of UNICEF's supply division. ""We are projecting now that we won't have the quantities we need until 2018.""""More than 100 countries are depending on those doses. Without them, planners worry that the eradication campaign will lose momentum, and so many children will go unprotected that there will be fresh outbreaks.""Two Vaccines, Multiple StrategiesPolio vaccination strategies are complicated but come down to this: Since the 1950s, there have been 2 vaccines, Jonas Salk's injectable formula [IPV], which uses a killed virus to evoke an immune response [also referred to as the ""inactived polio vaccine""], and Albert Sabin's oral version [OPV], which relies on a weakened live virus to do the same thing.Salk's vaccine was adopted by the industrialized world, but when eradication efforts began elsewhere, the people behind that campaign decided to rely on the oral poliovirus vaccine, known as OPV. That was partly because the drops are less expensive to buy and administer, because they can be given by volunteers with no medical training. But it was also because the weakened vaccine virus performs a trick that the Salk virus cannot: It reproduces in the guts of children and then is expelled in their feces -- and when it enters the environment, it can create immunity in anyone who accidentally ingests it, creating a kind of passive immunization.That ability to reproduce and spread is a marvelous tool, one that has an unintended consequence. The attenuated virus can mutate back to a disease-causing type, and when it reproduces, it spreads infection instead of protection. Last year [2015], there were only 74 cases of polio in the world, and 32 were caused by a ""vaccine-derived"" virus.To reduce the chances of that happening, the campaign switched all of the countries using OPV from one formula to another in April [2016]. The abandoned formula contained weakened versions of all 3 strains of poliovirus (dubbed type 1, 2 and 3). The new formula contained only types 1 and 3. The campaign removed type 2 because that strain has been eradicated in the wild -- it has not been picked up by any surveillance mechanisms since 1999 -- and because it was more likely to mutate into the disease-causing type, compared with the other 2 strains.Planners acknowledged the strategy held some risk; it raised the possibility of a type 2 outbreak, if that strain of virus reappeared or if a vaccine virus still in someone's system mutated and escaped. That risk was supposed to be nullified by a 2nd strategy: In every country still using OPV, children were also supposed to receive 1 shot of the injectable vaccine, because it contains all 3 strains and, being a killed-virus vaccine, does not lead to reproduction.That clever plan was working, but now IPV is running short. ""Every child born since May [2016], if they live in a country that does not have access to IPV, is not getting any immunity against the type 2 poliovirus,"" says Dr. Stephen Cochi, a pediatrician who leads the CDC's polio eradication effort. ""If we get an increased supply of IPV, we can catch up to those children. Before then, we have to depend on no vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks occurring.""To cope with the shortfall, the campaign has triaged countries still using OPV into tiers, depending on their risk of outbreak. The 3 countries that still harbor wild polio -- Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan -- are at the top of the list to receive the most IPV. Countries toward the bottom of the list will not receive any IPV doses until the supply situation improves; other manufacturers that bid on supplying the campaign are supposed to deliver vaccines in 2019.No Explanation on ShortagesThe 2 companies that fell short on deliveries are Bilthoven Biologicals BV in the Netherlands, owned by the Serum Institute of India, and Sanofi Pasteur in France. Bilthoven Biologicals did not respond to a request for comment. Ashleigh Koss, Sanofi Pasteur's head of media relations for North America, emailed a statement that acknowledged the shortage but did not explain it.Michel Zaffran, the WHO's director of polio eradication, said that the campaign knew there were supply difficulties before the vaccine switch in April [2016]. The agency's immunization advisers ""felt the benefits of removing [type 2 from the vaccine] far outweighed the risk,"" he said. ""But since April [2016], there have been further reductions in supply, and 29 countries have not been able to introduce IPV at all.""To stretch the supply, the WHO is urging countries to try ""fractional doses"" of the injectable, a tricky maneuver that involves injecting vaccine into the skin instead of into muscle. But that requires training and constitutes an off-label use, so some countries have been reluctant to do it.Preparing to add the injectable vaccine to existing national immunization programs was not a small task for countries, so in addition to the epidemiological risk of possibly sparking outbreaks, planners are concerned the reputation of the eradication campaign -- which already has consumed billions of dollars and occupied millions of volunteers -- will suffer as countries put what they did on hold.""I have had to personally visit several countries and explain to them why they are deprived of vaccine when other countries are getting it,"" Zaffran says. ""We insisted on countries introducing IPV for very good reasons, and now we are finding ourselves without enough vaccine to comply.""Despite the setback, researchers are hopeful that they can complete the mission. But the decision to switch vaccines turned out to be a bigger risk than anyone expected. To get through it, the campaign will need a little luck. And luck is never something to count on when dealing with infectious diseases.[Byline: Maryn McKenna]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Global update - Polio Eradication InitiativeDate: Wed 28 Dec 2016Source: Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Polio eradication this week (as of 28 Dec 2016):Wild poliovirus type 1 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases:Total cases: YTD*-2016: WPV** / cVDPV*** // YTD*-2015: WPV** / cVDPV*** // Total in 2015: WPV** / cVDPV***Globally: 35 / 3 // 70 / 27 // 74 / 32- in endemic countries: 35 / 0 // 70 / 3 // 74 / 3- in non-endemic countries: 0 / 3 // 0 / 24 // 0 / 29* YTD - year to date** WPV - wild poliovirus*** cVDPV - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirusCase breakdown by country:Countries: YTD-2016: WPV / cVDPV // YTD-2015: WPV / cVDPV // Total 2015: WPV / cVDPV // Onset paralysis most recent case: WPV / CVDPVAfghanistan: 12 / 0 // 19 / 0 // 20 / 0 // 11 Oct 2016 / NAGuinea: 0 / 0 // 0 / 4 // 0 / 7 // NA / 13 Dec 2015Lao PDR: 0 / 3 // 0 / 6 // 0 / 8 // NA / 10 Jan 2016Madagascar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 10 // 0 / 10 // NA / 21 Aug 2015Myanmar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 2 // NA / 4 Oct 2015Nigeria: 4 / 0 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 1 // 20 Aug 2016 / 15 May 2015Pakistan: 19 / 0 // 51 / 2 // 54 / 2 // 2 Nov 2016 / 8 Feb 2015Ukraine: 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 2 // NA / 6 Jul 2015NA: onset of paralysis in most recent case is prior to 2015.Figures exclude non-AFP sources.Madagascar, Ukraine and Lao PDR cVDPV1, all others cVDPV2.cVDPV definition: see document ""Reporting and classification of vaccine-derived polioviruses"" at <http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VDPV_ReportingClassification.pdf>Afghanistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 12. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Oct 2016], from Bermal district, Paktika province. Half of the country's cases this year [2016] are from Bermal district.- No environmental WPV1 positive samples have been reported in 2016. The most recent WPV1 positive samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] -- one in Jalalabad district of Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.Pakistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 19. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [10 Oct 2016], from Badin district, southeast Sindh.- Reported in Disease Outbreak News: In response to the detection in environmental samples of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Quetta, a response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) is now planned, in line with internationally-agreed type 2 poliovirus outbreak response protocols. The 1st in a series of campaigns is planned for [2 Jan 2017]. In addition, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, supported by WHO, UNICEF and other partners, is further strengthening active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and conducting an in-depth field investigation to more clearly ascertain the circulation of this strain.- The area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational common reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting WPV1 transmission in this area remains the top most priority of the federal, provincial and district health teams.- The last nationwide vaccination round of 2016 was completed nearly everywhere.Nigeria- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016], from Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.- Regional outbreak response in north-eastern Nigeria continues to be implemented, both in response to the WPV1 cases detected in August [2016] and to the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates, detected in Borno from an environmental sample (collected in March [2016]) and a healthy contact of one of the WPV1 cases (collected in August [2016]).- The emergency regional outbreak response is being implemented under the guidance of the polio eradication Emergency Operations Center (EOC), led by the Government of Nigeria and with support from WHO and GPEI partners. The outbreak response is being coordinated with neighboring countries (see 'Lake Chad Basin' update below) and in the context of the response to the broader humanitarian emergency affecting the region.Lake Chad Basin- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in Borno state, Nigeria poses a risk to the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.Guinea and West Africa- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is 7.- While signs are positive in Guinea, gaps remain sub-nationally both in population immunity and surveillance sensitivity. Undetected circulation cannot be ruled out. Efforts are continuing to rapidly fill these gaps and ensure the outbreak has been stopped.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type one (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3 in 2016 and 8 in 2015.- While no new cases have been detected since January [2016], subnational surveillance gaps persist and efforts to strengthen surveillance are therefore ongoing.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.Madagascar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015], from Sud-Ouest region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 is 10.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Looking at the contents of the 2 reports that comprise today's polio update [Fri 30 Dec 2016], there's good news and bad news. The good news is that in the past week there have been no new reports of paralytic polio cases neither due to the wild poliovirus (WPV) nor due to circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV).The potential bad news is the content of Maryn McKenna's article from Newsweek announcing the shortage of IPV -- the vaccine that was to be implemented to address the issue of cVDPVs, especially cVDPV2, the predominant strain seen. Since 2000, there have been 103 polio cases reported due to infection with a cVDPV1, 599 due to infection with a cVDPV2 and 12 due to infection with a cVDPV3 (<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/>).At the 17th ICID [International Congress on Infectious Diseases] conference held in Hyderabad in March 2016, there was a discussion on the known shortage of IPV and the gamble of switching to bivalent OPV without the type 2 virus. So far luck has been holding, but as the article so rightly states, ""luck is never something to count on when dealing with infectious diseases"".Maps showing the locations of reported paralytic polio cases can be found at: <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>. - Mod.MPP]
