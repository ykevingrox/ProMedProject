Miami Herald [edited]<http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article90617692.html>Florida health officials are investigating a Zika infection in Miami-Dade County that may be the 1st acquired within the state, according to an announcement late Tue [19 Jul 2016]. Health officials reported they are conducting an epidemiological investigation in collaboration with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.No details were provided regarding the potential mode of transmission. Zika is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, though the CDC has also reported cases of the virus spreading through blood transfusions, from pregnant mothers to their newborn children, and by sexual transmission.Florida health officials reported 7 new cases of Zika infection on Tue [19 Jul 2016], all acquired by people while traveling outside the country. The cases included 3 in Broward County, 3 in Orange County and 1 in Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade has the state's largest number of Zika [virus] infections, with 88 people having contracted the virus this year.Zika can be difficult to diagnose in part because only 1 in 5 infected people show symptoms, which include fever, joint pain, rash and red eyes lasting 7-10 days.While the CDC has not confirmed local transmission of Zika anywhere in the continental United States, evidence emerged this week that the virus is spreading in ways that are still a mystery to scientists. On Mon [18 Jul 2016], the CDC announced that epidemiologists are investigating a case in Utah involving a family member of an elderly man who contracted Zika while traveling outside the country and later died from complications of the disease after returning home. CDC officials reported that epidemiologists are interviewing and conducting blood tests of the dead man's family members and healthcare workers who may have had contact with the man, who died in Jun [2016].Health officials are also trapping mosquitoes in Utah and testing them for the virus to assess the potential for local transmission. However, the 2 species known to transmit Zika are not known to be present in Utah.Florida health officials said Zika prevention kits and repellent will be available for pick up in Miami-Dade and distributed in the area under investigation, which was not disclosed. Zika kits are intended for pregnant women, the health department said. County mosquito control has already conducted spraying and other prevention efforts in the neighborhood being investigated. Pregnant women and their children are considered to be at greatest risk from the disease. Researchers have concluded that prenatal Zika infection can cause microcephaly and other brain disorders. According to the health department, there are 43 pregnant women in Florida who have contracted the virus this year.[Byline: Daniel Chang]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Presumably, a viremic individual returned to Florida and provided an infectious blood meal for a vector mosquito that subsequently infected a local person. This is not surprising. In the past, there have been locally transmitted dengue viruses in Florida. The same vector mosquito transmits both viruses. Additional locally acquired cases where _Aedes aegypti_ is present in the southern USA can be expected during this transmission season.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Florida can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6998> and map of Florida sowing the location of Miami-Dade county at the southern tip of the state can be accessed at <http://geology.com/county-map/florida.shtml>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Utah: local transmissionDate: Mon 18 Jul 2016Source: CDC Media Statement [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0718-zika-utah-investigation.html>CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is assisting in the investigation of a case of Zika in a Utah resident who is a family contact of the elderly Utah resident who died in late Jun [2016]. The deceased patient had traveled to an area with Zika and lab tests showed he had uniquely high amounts of virus -- more than 100 000 times higher than seen in other samples of infected people -- in his blood. Laboratories in Utah and at the CDC reported evidence of Zika infection in both Utah residents.State and local public health disease control specialists, along with CDC, are investigating how the 2nd resident became infected. The investigation includes additional interviews with and laboratory testing of family members and health care workers who may have had contact with the person who died and trapping mosquitoes and assessing the risk of local spread by mosquitoes.A CDC Emergency Response Team (CERT) is in Utah at the request of the Utah Department of Health. The team includes experts in infection control, virology, mosquito control, disease investigation, and health communications. ""The new case in Utah is a surprise, showing that we still have more to learn about Zika,"" said Erin Staples, MD, PhD, CDC's Medical Epidemiologist on the ground in Utah. ""Fortunately, the patient recovered quickly, and from what we have seen with more than 1300 travel-associated cases of Zika in the continental United States and Hawaii, non-sexual spread from one person to another does not appear to be common.""As of 13 Jul 2016, 1306 cases of Zika have been reported in the continental United States and Hawaii; none of these have been the result of local spread by mosquitoes. These cases include 14 believed to be the result of sexual transmission and 1 that was the result of a laboratory exposure.Since early 2016, CDC has worked with state, local, and territorial public health officials to protect pregnant women from Zika infection, through these activities: - Alerts to pregnant women to avoid travel to an area with active Zika transmission, to women in these areas to take steps to prevent mosquito bites, and to partners of pregnant women to use a condom to prevent sexual transmission during pregnancy.- Development and distribution of PCR and IgM testing kits to confirm Zika virus infection.- Establishment of CDC Emergency Response Teams to rapidly deploy to assist with Zika-related preparedness and response activities in the United States.- Deployment of experts to assist in enhancement of mosquito surveillance and testing.- Collaboration with FDA, blood collection centers, and other entities in the public and private sectors on enhancement of surveillance of blood donations.- Guidance to prevent sexual transmission, particularly to women who are pregnant.- Guidance for clinicians on the care of pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika [virus].- Studies in collaboration with Brazil, Colombia, and other countries to better understand the link between Zika infection and birth defects, including microcephaly.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The obvious question is -- how did the caretaker become infected. Mosquitoes are unlikely as the source of the virus in this situation because no competent mosquito species is believed to be present in Utah. The source of the virus must have been the elderly man who subsequently died. He is reported to have had a very high viremia. Presumably there were substantial amounts of virus in urine and saliva as well. The importance of virus in saliva or urine as a source of transmissible virus has not been established. Clearly, this is an unusual case. With over 1300 Zika virus infected individuals reported in the USA, the only locally acquired cases were sexually transmitted, until now. ProMED would be interested in the results of the investigations by CDC and state specialists. - Mod.
