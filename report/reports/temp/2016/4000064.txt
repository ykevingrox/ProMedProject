The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/monkey-fever-in-wayanad/article6863540.ece>Of the 14 blood samples tested for Kyasanur Forest Disease in the district, 12 have been found positive. District Health Officer Neeta Vijayan told The Hindu that the samples had been sent to the Virology institute at Manipal in Karnataka.Dr. Neeta said that 27 cases of suspected Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, have been reported in various parts of the district in a fortnight [14 days]. The outbreak of the viral disease, transmitted to humans through a species of ticks found on monkeys, has been mainly reported from tribal hamlets in Mullankolly and Pulpally grama panchayats [local self-government organizations at the village or small-town level] in Sulthan Bathery taluk [subdistrict]. Though 1 case each had been reported each in 2013 and 2014, this is the 1st time an outbreak has been reported in the district.The Health Department has started giving free vaccinations to Forest Department officials and casual labourers engaged in work inside the Kurichiyat forest range under the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. As many as 160 forest staff and casual labourers were vaccinated on Thursday.The chances of monkey fever spreading to Kozhikode cannot be ruled out, District Medical Officer P.K. Mohanan has said. ""There are many monkeys on the ghat roads between Kozhikode and Wayanad. Travellers should be cautious,"" he said.[Byline: E.M. Manoj] --Communicated by: Sandeep RamalingamNHS Lothian, UK<sandeep.ramalingam@nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk>[Transmission of KFD virus to humans and monkeys continues in the Wayanad district of Kerala state again in 2016. On 11 Mar 2015, 6 human cases were reported in the district, increasing to 9 on 23 Apr 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150312.3225579) and then to 11. Mortality among bonnet macaques was substantial during 2015.Kerala state is endemic for KFD virus, which has started to be actively transmitted again this season. An 18 Feb 2015 report indicated that human cases there had reached 40 suspected and 18 confirmed infections in just 3 weeks. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.Vaccination and avoidance of tick bites are practical preventive measures but require educating local residents of the area about the risk of acquiring the infection and the severity of the disease. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Apparently, a vaccine is available for KFD.As noted in the previous posts, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case fatality rate is 3-5 percent.Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf>).ProMED thanks Sandeep Ramalingam for sending in this report.
