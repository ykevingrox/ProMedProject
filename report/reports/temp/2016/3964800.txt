Punch (Nigeria) [edited]<http://www.punchng.com/measles-kill-5-in-oyo/>The Oyo State Government has ordered the Ministry of Health to start the emergency immunisation of children in the state after 5 persons were killed by measles.A government source, who spoke on condition anonymity, told our correspondent that all the deaths were recorded in the Sabo area of Ibadan.Two weeks ago, the state government had announced that measles immunisation would be conducted between 28 Jan and 1 Feb 2016. But the deaths recorded apparently influenced the latest directive.""The state Ministry of Health will begin vaccination against measles on 19 Jan 2016 instead of the earlier scheduled date of 28 Jan 2016,"" the source said. ""This is informed by the death of 5 people because of the disease. The state is committed to safeguarding the lives of the citizens.""The state's Health Educator, Mrs. Oluwatoyin Olawoyin, had earlier said that the exercise would target children from 9 months to 59 months and that 2.5 million children would be given the vaccine.She said, ""In 2015, 761 blood samples from children were taken to the laboratory as part of the state measles surveillance activity. We had 9.7 per cent of the number with negative result, while 3.7 per cent tested positive to measles. The number of children who tested positive in 491 cases in 2014 was 2.2 per cent, while in 2013, 15.3 per cent of 567 blood samples belonging to children tested positive to it.""The exercise will be conducted by the state government with support from the World Health Organisation, and it will involve 15 708 personnel grouped into 2244 teams.WHO Measles Campaign Consultant Adamu Bello said that the rate of success in most vaccination drives was 85 per cent, with the rest to be subjected to a 2nd chance.[Byline: Olufemi Atoyebi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED HealthMap for Oyo State, Nigeria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13627>]******[2] NigeriaDate: 20 Jan 2016Source: Nigeria Master Web [edited]<http://nigeriamasterweb.com/Masterweb/breakingnews-20116-measles-foremost-source-morbidity-and-mortality>Measles still remains a foremost source of morbidity and mortality in Nigerian children, regardless of being vaccine avertable.The precarious scene of measles has made it garner such headlines as: ""Nigeria to immunise 35 million children against measles - Official, 3 Oct 2013"", ""Measles, child killer disease, ravages 12 Northern Nigerian States, 17 Mar 2013,"" ""Kebbi records 93 more cases of measles in rural areas, 22 Jan 2013,"" ""Bauchi records 80 per cent measles immunisation coverage, 13 Dec 2015"", ""Measles: 515, 531 Ekiti children for immunisation, 19 Jan 2016,"" ""16 000 Nigerian children under 5 die everyday in 2015 - WHO,"" and so many others.The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) said during the kick-off of the 2015 Annual Physicians' Week on Sun 25 Oct 2015 that that record exposed that escapable childhood maladies like measles remain one of the primary causes of death among Nigerian children, with 2013 alone recording 145 700 measles deaths globally and about 400 deaths every day or 16 deaths every hour.The United Nations International Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) stated that measles killed 112 Nigerian children in 2015. It said that in 2014 there were nearly 150 000 measles deaths worldwide, nearly 500 deaths every day or nearly 20 deaths every hour.The UNICEF's Dr. Emmanuel Idoko made this known in Abakaliki on 19 Jan 2016 at a one-day media course meeting on the 2016 Measles Vaccination Campaign (MVC). The worry is that there were 22 567 suspected cases across the 36 states of the federation and Abuja in 2015.What the headlines mean is that Nigeria is trading on a dangerous path with measles characteristically, being that it is a communicable disease that proliferates swiftly among children.Studies have sought to find out whether there is any association between measles immunisation coverage and measles outbreaks, because of the incessant news of measles that come out of Nigeria, but corruption and biddableness against the fight have been noticed as culprits as to why the battle is yet to be won.The National Surveillance Officer, World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Irene Isibor, frowned at the 19th Biennial Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria, held at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos, saying that ""due to people's wrong attitude,"" most children in Nigeria still die from vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.""Everyday in 2015, 16 000 children under 5 years continued to die, mostly from preventable causes. Child survival must remain the focus of the post-2015 development agenda. The distribution of the estimated deaths among children under 5 years of age from diseases that are preventable by vaccination in 2008 in Nigeria shows that measles accounts for 118 000."" she said.The most vulnerable are children under 9 months, which is the main reason children are supposed to habitually get measles vaccination at age 9 months. Campaign surveys have shown, however, that many children do not get it. Immunisation coverage dropped, hence, much effort is not made to increase measles immunisation in children between 9 and 59 months, bearing in mind that measles immunisation coverage in urban and rural areas was not markedly different, said experts.Mr. Chukwuemeka Anthony Umeh at Hospitals Management Board, Bayelsa State, in a hypothesis made available to Pan African Medical Journal in 2013, said, ""Efforts at immunising children against measles were intensified in Nigeria with nationwide measles vaccination campaigns in 2005-2006, 2008 and 2011 targeting children between 9 and 59 months. However, there were measles outbreaks in 2010 and 2011 in Abia State.""Measles has become a cause for concern in Nigeria as many children are becoming victim every day. It means that if nothing urgent is done, measles may wipe out a lot more children, apart from the number it has already recorded. Oyo State Government, for example, was thrown into mourning early this year [2016] when 5 children were lost to the disease.Three million children between 9 and 59 months were to be vaccinated during an exercise scheduled for 21-25 Nov 2015, according to Malam Hamza Ikara, Health Educator, Kaduna State Primary Healthcare Agency (SPHCA).The World Health Organization (WHO), in partnership with the Ministry of Health in Taraba State, on 14 Nov 2015 heralded plans to vaccinate no fewer than 760 128 children against measles in the state. The exercise was to be held between 21-25 Nov 2015.No fewer than 97 000 children were to be vaccinated against measles in the Dutse Local Government Council of Jigawa, Alhaji Sani Yusif, the Health Education Officer, said through the council's Information Officer, Malam Ya'u Garba in Dutse in November 2015.The Chairman of Kebbi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr Farouk Wakili, said his state's campaign was targeted at 700 000 children.While families and states and crusaders are crying over the children who lost their lives to measles, checks revealed that 25 million Nigerian children are yet to receive vaccination against measles. What this means is that the country should expect an increase in the number.""There are still children among those suspected or confirmed cases of measles. Over 63 percent are zero doses, which means they have never had any immunisation,"" said Dr Damaris Onwuka, the director of disease control and immunisation at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency.Conversely, there was a planned nationwide campaign to immunise at least 39 million children aged 9 months to 59 months in November 2015. But that idea became a tall dream as the National Primary Health Care Development Agency did not meet up; it reiterated that the exercise would culminate into this year [2016].How more than 25 million children born in the last 5 years did not have any vaccination against measles, as figures show, is not known.""National coverage of measles vaccine when combined with oral polio vaccination did not exceed 70 percent between 2003 and 2010. A 1st phase of the latest stand-alone measles vaccination will target children in 19 northern states and the FCT between 21 and 25 Nov 2015. A 2nd phase from 28 Jan to 1 Feb next year (2016) will target 17 southern states,"" Dr Chinedu Okoronkwo of the agency told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).The irony is that governments at all levels and the international community are not taking a lackadaisical approach in combating measles. Monies are being budgeted and projected to curb the menace, but that the authorities responsible for the management of the money have not been able to arrest the situation calls for concern.""Around 10 percent of the entire campaign cost is borne by federal and state government, contributing USD 3.731 million to operational spending. The rest, including vaccines said to have arrived in the country recently, is paid for by international donors through the Global Alliance for Vaccine Initiative, GAVI,"" reported the Daily Trust.Indications are that the campaign against measles will cost at least an estimated USD 45.5 million.Isibor pinpointed 3 key steps to close the immunisation gap, including integrating immunisation with other services such as post-natal care for mothers and babies, Daily Times reported. The source added that other steps were strengthening the health system to accommodate all categories, especially during crisis, with regards to assuring that everyone can access vaccines and afford to pay for them.""To fight this scourge and other such health conditions, the NMA called for immediate declaration of a national emergency in the health sector and put all machinery in place towards eradicating the negative health situation from the country,"" reported NAN.[Byline: Odimegwu Onwumere]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED HealthMap for Nigeria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>]******[3] USADate: 20 Jan 2016Source: About.com [edited]<http://pediatrics.about.com/od/inthenews/fl/Measles-Outbreaks-2016.htm>In the United States, rates of measles, a vaccine-preventable disease, had been fairly low since the endemic spread of measles was eliminated in 2000.Before the routine use of the measles vaccine (1963) and the MMR vaccine (1971), though, measles cases -- and complications from those cases -- were high. There used to be about 500 000 cases of measles and 500 measles deaths each year in the United States.Unfortunately, measles cases have been on the rise recently. After hitting a record low number of cases in 2004 (just 37 cases), we seem to continue to hit new record highs for measles every few years now.There were at least 667 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. in 2014, the most since 1994. And while 2015 got off to a very strong start, with the Disneyland outbreak in California, it did fortunately slow down, ending with 189 cases in 24 states.Most concerning, more and more, cases don't seem to have a source that is easy to find, which could mean that the endemic spread of measles has returned in the United States. So instead of having to travel out of the country or be exposed to someone who got measles with a link to international travel, you could get measles just by going to a ball game, a movie theater, or to Disneyland. That makes it more important than ever to learn how to avoid measles.Recent measles outbreaks and exposures include:An unvaccinated child in Richardson, Texas who traveled out of the country and who may have exposed others at his elementary school in the Plano ISD. (2016)A student at UC Berkeley who may have exposed others to measles on a public bus. (2015)A confirmed case in Fairbanks, Alaska, their 1st case in 15 years, who flew in from Seattle (and is probably the King County case discussed below) and may have exposed others at an area Walmart, Home Depot, Walgreens, several supermarkets, the airport, and hospital, etc. (2015)A confirmed case in Branson, Missouri, a traveler from Asia, who was contagious when visiting the ER, 3 local businesses, and perhaps his flight to town. (2015)A confirmed case in the Washington D.C. area. (2015)Another case of measles in Spokane County, Washington - an unvaccinated person that was exposed to the other case in the area. (2015)An unvaccinated student from Europe in Boston, Massachusetts who also traveled to Maine and New Hampshire. (2015)Another unvaccinated child in St. Lucie County, Florida, bringing the total to 5 cases in central Florida in what so far looks like 2 separate outbreaks. (2015)Other things to know about measles and measles outbreaks include:From 2 to 5 percent of people do not respond to their 1st dose of measles vaccine, which is why a 2nd (booster) dose is recommended. But more than 99 percent of people develop immunity to measles after 2 doses of a measles vaccine, like MMR.A booster dose of MMR was 1st recommended in 1989, so many adults born before 1985 may not have had 2 doses of MMR.Measles is fatal in about 0.2 percent of cases.Very few of the measles cases in these outbreaks are in people who are completely vaccinated. For example, in the outbreaks in Europe in 2011, when 30 000 people got measles, causing 8 deaths, 27 cases of measles encephalitis, and 1482 cases of pneumonia, most cases were in unvaccinated (82 percent) or incompletely vaccinated (13 percent) people.In addition to many developing countries where measles is still endemic, international measles outbreaks have been reported in Europe, Japan, and the Philippines, etc., which makes it important to make sure you are fully vaccinated before traveling out of the US.The measles virus is spread by respiratory droplets and can stay in an area for up to 2 hours after a person with measles symptoms has left.People with measles are contagious from 4 days before they develop the measles rash.Call your pediatrician if you think your child has measles (don't just show up at their office or in the ER), especially if he develops a high fever and/or rash during a local measles outbreak or after a trip out of the country.It is expensive to contain a measles outbreak.Most importantly, parents should understand that a measles vaccine (MMR) is the best way to protect your child from measles and is especially important if there is a measles outbreak in your area or if you are traveling to an area with high rates of measles.The rise in measles cases around the world has changed the recommendations for measles vaccination in the U.S. While children routinely get their 1st MMR vaccine at 12 months and a booster dose at 4 years, if they are traveling overseas, infants should get their 1st dose as young as 6 months of age. Children who are at least 12 months old should get 2 doses of MMR, separated by at least 28 days.Sources:CDC. Notifiable Diseases and Mortality Tables.

He has since recovered.So far, there have been no other confirmed cases, but the agency warned that the child's classmates and school staff will not get the all clear until 21 days after the potential exposure date, the Dallas Morning News reports.Around one in 8 children in the U.S. are at risk of catching measles because of gaps in vaccination rates, experts have warned.Those who are not vaccinated or who are under-vaccinated are highly susceptible to becoming sick with the highly contagious illness. The virus can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis and even death.An investigation by KXAS-TV found that Plano Independent School District had some of the highest numbers of unvaccinated students in North Texas, with more than 800 not protected against measles.One concerned parent called for anyone who didn't believe in vaccinating to keep their children away from school""I realize vaccines are a choice, but so is home schooling..."" one person wrote on Facebook. Another posted: ""I pray for no new cases. This was totally preventable.""Last year [2015] health officials said measles was up again in the U.S.Plano ISD spokeswoman Lesley Range-Stanton said Schell Elementary School was following protocol from the health care services and had received ""extra cleaning measures"" after the case.Measles cases have slowly been rising in the United States in recent years.In 2014, the CDC reported a record 667 cases, the highest number since the virus was officially eradicated from the country in 2000. Around half of the cases were down to a major outbreak in the unvaccinated Ohio Amish community.Last year [2015], a woman in Washington state became the 1st person to die from measles in the U.S. in 12 years.At Disneyland, California, more than 120 people -- including a 4-month-old baby -- were infected in a mass outbreak, and hundreds more across 18 states were told to quarantine themselves inside while they were monitored for the virus.Measles is one of the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, meaning that to prevent epidemics, it's necessary to maintain high levels of immunity.The success of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) meant measles was officially wiped out in the Unites States 16 years ago, although it is still prevalent in many other countries around the world.Travelers to certain parts of Asia and Africa continue to bring the disease into the U.S., which can then spread when it reaches a community where groups of people are unvaccinated.Measles cases have slowly been rising in the United States in recent years. Last year [2015], an outbreak at Disneyland, California infected more than 120 people.The CDC urges people to get vaccinated for measles.The worrying increase in the potentially deadly virus has been blamed on the rise of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children.A fraudulent research paper in the medical journal The Lancet made the claim in 1998 that the vaccine was linked to colitis and autism.The claim was later discredited, but the debate led to an anti-vaccination movement by some parents who perceived the life-saving jabs to be dangerous.Michelle Schneider, communications director for Texans for Vaccine Choice, said she believes families had the right to decide whether to vaccinate or not.Appearing to play down the seriousness of measles, she said the potentially fatal virus results in ""a benign illness very much similar to a cold in a vast majority of cases.""""Communicable disease is just a matter of life,"" she told the Dallas Morning News, explaining that she believed good nutrition and taking precautions when traveling abroad would protect her family.Political figures have weighed in on the issue of vaccination, with President Barack Obama saying that there is ""no reason"" for all parents not to have their children immunized after the Disneyland breakout.The increase in people choosing not to vaccinate their child also raises the risk for children who cannot receive the injection for medical reasons, such as having a weakened immune system.The MMR vaccine is about 93 per cent effective at preventing measles at one dose, and 97 per cent with bothChildren under a year old also cannot receive the vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella, leaving them vulnerable to outbreaks.Dr Robert Bednarczyk, lead author of a study on national vaccination rates, said: ""We know some parents have concerns about vaccines and may want to avoid or delay vaccination, or follow an alternative schedule than the one recommended because they're concerned about the safety of the vaccine. In fact, the vaccine is very safe, while not vaccinating is highly risky, leaving their children -- and others -- vulnerable to a serious illness that can cause a large number of complications. Currently, these children are protected because of the high vaccine coverage of the population, but that will change if we begin having more outbreaks and the percentage of children vaccinated declines.""If the percentage of vaccinated children drops to just 98 per cent of current levels, researchers estimate that 14.2 per cent of children -- one in 7 -- would be vulnerable to measles.The analysis of national vaccination rates, presented at ID Week in San Diego last October [2015], revealed that 9 million children, from infants to 17 year olds, are now susceptible to catching measles.The findings are significant because in their analysis, researchers from Emory University found the percentage of children immune to measles is very close to the range of 92 to 94 per cent.Below this threshold, measles outbreaks are possible and could lead to widespread illness.Measles is not currently widespread thanks to herd immunity, meaning the majority of people have been vaccinated. This ensures the number of people vulnerable to infection is small and helps protect those who can't be vaccinated by preventing their exposure to the virus.Researchers also found that nearly one in 4 children aged 3 or younger are at risk, and that nearly 5 per cent of 17-year-olds had not received any doses of the vaccine.Dr Bednarczyk said: ""Although we eliminated continuous measles transmission in the U.S. about 15 years ago thanks to the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and robust vaccination rates, these study results show that we can't get complacent. While we currently have overall immunity in the population that should prevent sustained measles transmission, if the virus is introduced, there is the potential for large outbreaks. This is because there are clusters of unvaccinated children in some communities, which could allow a large outbreak to occur with spread to similar communities."" It is recommended that all children receive 2 doses of measles-containing vaccines at the relevant ages, he said.The MMR vaccine is given to children in 2 doses, the 1st at 12 to 15 months and the 2nd at 4 to 6 years old.While children are required to receive the MMR vaccine before attending school, some are exempt because they have a medical issue or for religious or personal reasons.Three states, including California, have now stopped allowing non-vaccinated children to attend school on anything but medical grounds.[Byline: Hannah Parry]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED HealthMap for Texas, United States: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>]******[5] Canada (Ontario)Date: 8 Jan 2016Source: Citynews [edited]<http://www.citynews.ca/2016/01/08/health-officials-warn-of-possible-measles-exposure-at-locations-in-brampton-and-mississauga/>Peel Public Health officials are investigating a potential case of measles in a child from Brampton who could have exposed the public to the disease at several locations in Brampton and Mississauga.In a release, Peel Public Health says the child, who arrived in Canada from a measles-endemic country before becoming ill, was at the following locations between 1-5 Jan 2016.1 Jan 2016, Emirates Airline Flight EK0605 from Karachi to Dubai to Toronto1 Jan 2016, Toronto Pearson International Airport Terminal One, 3:25 to 7:25 p.m.3 Jan 2016, Multi-Specialty Walk In Clinic, 21 Queensway West, Mississauga, 8 to 11 p.m.5 Jan 2016, Brampton Urgent Care Clinic, Springdale Square, Unit 8, 51 Mountainash Road, Brampton, 8 to 10 p.m.5 Jan 2016, Brampton Civic Hospital Emergency Department, 2100 Bovaird Drive East, Brampton, 8:45 p.m. on 5 Jan 2016 to 3:45 a.m. on 6 Jan 2016""Anyone who was in the following places during the times listed may have been exposed to measles,"" health officials warned.""The virus can only live outside the body (e.g., on surfaces and door handles) for up to 2 hours, so people who visited these locations at other times were not exposed.""Measles symptoms appear 3 weeks after exposure.
