News 1130 [edited]<http://www.news1130.com/2016/02/11/bc-syphilis-rates/> Syphilis rates in this province [British Columbia] are at their highest in 3 decades, and that's prompted Vancouver Coastal Health [VCH] to declare an outbreak. ""In 2015, nearly 500 cases of infectious syphilis [primary and secondary syphilis] were reported in Vancouver Coastal Health, more than double the yearly cases reported a decade ago,"" says Dr. Reka Gustafson with VCH. ""Because new infections continue to climb, we have initiated a formal outbreak response.""The health authority says it is stepping up its efforts by working directly with physicians and community groups to increase testing and promote awareness of the steps that can be taken to prevent, diagnose and treat syphilis. There is a particular focus on urging gay men to get tested regularly. Vancouver Coastal Health says 97 percent of syphilis diagnoses are male and over 80 percent identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men (MSM). VCH says it's seen a shift to younger men, with the largest increase in syphilis rates among 20 to 24-year-olds. It adds syphilis is being diagnosed both among men living with HIV and those who are not, pointing out having syphilis increases the risk of getting HIV infection. Dr. Reka Gustafson explains who is most at risk and prevention measures: On Sunday [14 Feb 2016], VCH, Positive Living BC, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), YouthCO and Health Initiative for Men (HIM) will launch a marketing campaign focusing on gay men. Syphilis is a contagious infection spread primarily by sexual activity. People with syphilis may not know they have it because they may not have symptoms. It can be cured with antibiotics. However, if syphilis is left untreated, it can lead to blindness, hearing loss, deep bone pain and neurological problems. Severe cases can be fatal. VCH and the BCCDC recommend that men who have sex with men get tested every 3 to 6 months, and visit their doctor if they have sores, bumps, a rash, blisters or warts on or around their genitals or anal area. They also recommend using condoms. Click here [<http://smartsexresource.com/>] to find a testing clinic.

[Byline: Denise Wong]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts <promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 10 Feb 2016Source: SooToday [edited]<https://www.sootoday.com/local-news/sexual-health-why-are-stis-on-the-rise-in-our-area-196107> The concern over the rise in STIs [sexually transmitted infections] in our area, and the urge to safeguard against them, was expressed by Algoma Public Health (APH) in a news release issued Monday [8 Feb 2016] as [8 to 12 Feb 2016] is Sexual and Reproductive Health Awareness Week.The news release said since 2010, gonorrhea has increased by 270 percent and chlamydia by 17 percent in Algoma [district, Ontario province], while there has also been an increase in syphilis, once rarely seen in our district or Canada. There are several reasons why the number of confirmed cases of STIs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis is on the rise in the Sault and Algoma district, APH has told SooToday. ""Gonorrhea and chlamydia can easily be transmitted through vaginal, oral or anal sex and a lot of people may not consider that they still need to use condoms when they have vaginal, oral, or anal sex,"" said Carolyn Kargiannakis, APH public health nurse. ""A lot of people also may have the false impression that STIs are under control ... but they remain unaware of the fact that we do have an increased incidence of them."" While technology and social media can be a great thing, it can, like everything else, also be a bad thing. ""There is the use of online, hookup apps that are easily available and are being utilized by people within our district (leading to more STIs),"" Kargiannakis said. ""It's not only with young people but we're seeing an increase of adults over 30 years old in that hookup culture."" Ironically, the number of people being tested for STIs also may be a factor when considering the reasons behind the increased numbers, Kargiannakis said. ""It may be due to the improvements in testing methods, because testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia is simply done through a urine test for both males and females, so the availability and ease of testing may actually be driving more people to get tested. That's a good thing, but then we're seeing more confirmed cases of STIs."" Sexually active people with multiple partners could be a factor as well. ""Even though one person in a relationship may be monogamous, they may assume their partner is monogamous too but that may not always be the case, so people must communicate and talk to their partner,"" Kargiannakis said. APH states there has been a 47 percent increase in confirmed cases of chlamydia in people 25 [years of age] and over in Algoma, though the largest number of confirmed cases of that infection is in the 15 to 24 age group. With gonorrhea, the largest increase is in the 15 to 24 age group, but also on the rise in people 25 and over. ""We really want to increase awareness of prevention, transmission, the fact that testing for these infections is easily available and it's free, and the fact that treatment for most STIs is easily available and free as well,"" Kargiannakis said. ""We want to empower our residents within the district to access testing ... we're hoping sexually active people will include testing for STIs as part of their health screening."" Testing is available through APH (call 705-541-7100 or toll free at 1-800-726-0398) or your health care provider. If left untreated, STIs in women can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), complications of which include long-term pelvic/abdominal pain and infertility. In men, untreated STIs can lead to pain in the tubes attached to the testicles and sterility. APH's advice is for each person to know his/her status (if they have or don't have an STI), their partner's status, use condoms and have routine testing done. Another word of caution. It is becoming more difficult to treat certain STIs. ""With some of these infections, especially gonorrhea, we're seeing a lot of antibiotic-resistant strains across the province and that is a concern,"" Kargiannakis said, adding it is ""absolutely"" more important than ever to be careful. Most faith-based groups teach refraining from sex before traditional, opposite-sex marriage in order to avoid STIs and a host of other problems. Secular health authorities, including APH, advocate being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test results and to use condoms.

The 2nd news report on sexually transmitted infections in Northeastern Ontario does not characterize the cases of sexually transmitted diseases as to the sex of the sex partners. Information in this regard, if available, would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. A recent ProMED-mail post on syphilis in Ottawa, Ontario (Syphilis - Canada (03): (ON) increased incidence, MSM, RFI 20150725.3535696), however, said that all of the cases of syphilis in the prior year (July 2014 to June 2015) were men, and more than 90 percent were men who have sex with men [MSM].
