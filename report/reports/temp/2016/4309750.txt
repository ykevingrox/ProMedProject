A similar event in Kenya, also with fatal outcomes, was described in MMWR report <https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5334a4.htm>.The age distribution, clustering in families, and absence of signs of infection (notably fever) suggest a toxin, and aflatoxin contamination of a staple food like maize or cassava is a possibility that should be investigated.--Niklas Danielsson<niklas.danielsson@ecdc.europa.eu>[The original ProMED post stated:- ""It all started when 9 members of the same family in Mwaikisabe Village, Chemba District, became ill after reportedly eating meat from a cow that was slaughtered after breaking one of its legs.""- ""Patients suffer from vomiting and diarrhoea, and their eyes and skin turn yellow. They also complain of aching stomachs. So far, 21 people have been reported with these symptoms, and 7 have died. To prevent the disease from spreading further, the remaining patients have been quarantined at Dodoma Regional Hospital, while others are at Kondoa District Hospital,"" Ms Mwalimu said.Some of these complaints sound like they may be associated with aflatoxin.The MMWR report cited by the submitter states:- ""The 2004 outbreak resulted from widespread aflatoxin contamination of locally grown maize, which occurred during storage of the maize under damp conditions.""The 2nd posting in the thread, ""Undiagnosed illness - Tanzania (02): (DO) fatal 20160623.4304102,"" contained the following statement:- ""A day after the deaths [9 Jun 2016], 5 other patients from the same family were admitted with the same symptoms, and one of them, a 21-year-old male, died on the same day after presenting with symptoms of fulminant liver failure as well. [None of the patients reported a history of fever], and the monitoring in the hospital did not record a rise of temperature [in any of them]. The index family had a history of eating uninspected meat, however more than 8 families ate the same meat and did not report any symptoms.""The combination of all these posts shows confusing information not fully investigated. Some ate meat and became ill. Later, we find others ate meat and did not become ill. Then we learn that there was fulminant liver failure in some patients supposedly consuming meat. The index family ate uninspected meat, but more than 8 families ate the same meat and did not report any symptoms. Perhaps meat is not the cause of the illness, or there is more than one illness involved?Aflatoxins are a group of fungal metabolic products formed by at least 2 species of fungus, _Aspergillus flavus_ and _A. parasiticus_, in several agricultural commodities, including corn or maize. Two structural types of aflatoxins are known (B and G types), of which aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic. Exposure to aflatoxins occurs primarily through ingestion of contaminated foods and can cause hepatic and gastrointestinal injury and have immunosuppressive, teratogenic, and oncogenic effects. Chronic low-level aflatoxin exposure can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Severe, acute liver injury with high morbidity and mortality has been associated with high-dose exposures to aflatoxins. Ingestion of 2--6 mg/day of aflatoxin for a month can cause acute hepatitis and death.Aflatoxin grows on improperly stored grains and other commodities, such as cassava, chili peppers, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, and a variety of spices. In certain environmental conditions aflatoxin may grow on the grains/nuts prior to harvest. Consumption of the contaminated grains can produce clinical signs in animals and people. The most prominent sign is liver failure. Vomiting, and diarrhea may be seen in cases involving aflatoxin.If an animal eats grain infected with aflatoxin, the animal may die of liver failure, but someone consuming the meat of that animal will not die of aflatoxin poisoning. Affected grains must be directly consumed to produce symptoms. Therefore, did the people actually die from eating meat? Or did they die from some grain ingestion, such as aflatoxin-containing maize [i.e., unrelated to the meat consumption - Mod.LM]? The articles do not adequately answer the question of what people are dying from. The investigation needs to continue. Did all of the fatalities suffer from liver failure? Perhaps grains should be investigated for aflatoxin. Or are there other clinical or pathological signs of the deceased that have not been released? - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/200>.][See Also:Undiagnosed illness - Tanzania (02): (DO) fatal 20160623.4304102Undiagnosed illness - Tanzania: (DO) fatal, RFI 20160622.43010572015----Aflatoxin, grain - Malawi 20151021.3734197 2013----Aflatoxin, maize, milk - EU 20130325.1601564 2011----Aflatoxin, milk, cooking oil - china 20111231.3719 Aflatoxin, dog food - USA: recall 20111230.3704 2010----Aflatoxin, canine - Tanzania 20100711.2316 Aflatoxin, maize - Kenya (03): (EA) human cases 20100708.2276 Aflatoxin, maize - Kenya (02) 20100618.2044 Aflatoxin, maize - Kenya: alert 20100512.1543 2008----Aflatoxin, livestock feed - Cyprus 20080824.2642 Aflatoxin, equine feed - USA: (multistate), recall 20080508.1574 2007----Aflatoxin, peanuts - Saudi Arabia (Riyadh) 20070830.2863 2006----Aflatoxin poisoning, fatal - Kenya 20060505.1306 Aflatoxin, dog food - Israel (02): RFI 20060216.0507 Aflatoxin, dog food - Israel 20060210.0445 2005----Aflatoxin, dog food - USA (multistate)(04): recall 20051231.3719 Aflatoxin, dog food - USA (multistate)(03) 20051224.3676 Aflatoxin, dog food - USA (NY)(02): multistate 20051223.3668 Aflatoxin, dog food - USA (NY) 20051222.3657 Aflatoxin poisoning, fatal - Kenya (02) 20050521.1408 Aflatoxin poisoning, fatal - Kenya 20050514.1324].................................................tg/msp/lm"
