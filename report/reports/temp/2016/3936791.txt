He developed a fever and other symptoms on 27 Dec 2015, but his condition recently deteriorated and includes severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, the statement said.He had contact with live poultry before falling ill, officials said. He tested positive for H5N1 today [13 Jan 2016]. 58 of his close contacts are under observation, with no further cases noted so far.This appears to be the world's 1st H5N1 case of the year [2016].

Since 2003 the country has confirmed 52 cases and 31 deaths. As of 14 Dec [2015], the WHO had confirmed 844 cases, including 449 deaths, for a case-fatality rate of 53 percent.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Although H5N1 does not usually infect humans, 844 human cases of H5N1 have been reported from 15 countries since 2003. The virus is a highly pathogenic avian (bird) flu virus that has caused serious outbreaks in domestic poultry in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Activity has been reported throughout the years also from Europe, in poultry and wild birds, without human cases.Most human cases of ""highly pathogenic"" H5N1 virus infection have occurred in people who had recent contact with sick or dead poultry that were infected with H5N1 viruses, as was the case with the individual reported above. H5N1 usually does not spread between people.
