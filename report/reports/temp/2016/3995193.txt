According to the information in the announcement, the reported activity that put him at risk was a night trip to the Canal River, near Fresia.The Deputy Seremi, Sofia Torres, states that since the status of the patient became complicated, it was decided to send him to a [health] assistance center in Santiago, where he was admitted. However, the person was discharged on 2 Feb [2016] due to his favorable progress. Currently, the patient is in the home of his family in Rancagua, where it is anticipated that he will go to a [health] assistance facility in this city to be under medical supervision, which must happen during this week. [Published by Daniel Medina, information from Claudio Weken]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Los Lagos region is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The above report provides little information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infections, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and of Region de Los Lagos at<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4961>. - Mod.TY]
