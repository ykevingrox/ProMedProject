The New Indian Express [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2016/nov/11/encephalitis-toll-set-to-cross-100-1537296.html>Collective measures to contain the outbreak notwithstanding, the toll of Japanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases in the state is set to cross 100.With 2 more deaths in the past 24 hours, 96 people have died of both diseases in 62 days in Malkangiri district. The administration put the toll at 87, however, including 57 AES cases and the rest JE. The count has kept spiraling for the past few days, as people still prefer disaris (village priests) to doctors and report late to hospitals.The children who succumbed to AES have been identified as from Bayanaikguda and from Korukonda. They died while undergoing treatment at Malkangiri district headquarters hospital.The toll this year [2016] is officially the highest since 2012. Although suspected AES cases and deaths, including a few JE positive cases, have been reported in Malkangiri over the last 4 years, 54 positive cases were reported in 2012, of which 39 children died. No death was recorded in 2013, 2014 and 2015.Meanwhile, an 8 member expert team from Ayush Department visited the district on Wednesday [9 Nov 2016] and inquired about the cause of the outbreak of the disease. The team members visited some of the affected villages and interacted with parents of the victims.Director of health services Dr Kailash Chandra Dash said 8 pediatric specialists are engaged to treat patients in the district headquarters hospital. ""A serious trend has emerged in most of the fresh cases. The kids are succumbing to the disease in 10-12 hours after they develop symptoms. In some cases, no improvement is witnessed even if they are kept on ventilators,"" he said.Meanwhile, Adivasi Samaj Mahasangh has intensified its agitation against the government for its failure to contain the vectorborne disease. Hundreds of tribals gathered the Collectorate demanding compensation for family members of the victims and permanent solutions to check the outbreak.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Another 11 Nov 2016 report indicated that the death toll has now reached 100 (<http://www.odishanewsinsight.com/odisha/japanese-encephalitis-claims-100-lives-malkangiri/>). Apparently, about 1/3rd of the encephalitis cases are due to JE, and the remaining 2/3rds are classified as AES with unspecified etiologies. Possible etiologies of AES are discussed in the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20161111.4621162). One hopes that the team investigating the outbreak will provide reliable diagnoses of these cases and measures that might be taken to prevent them and to optimise treatment for those affected.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>.]
