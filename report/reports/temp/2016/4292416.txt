Press Information Bureau, Government of India [edited]<http://pib.nic.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=31>India continues to be Polio-FreeSpecial Immunization Drive to be taken up in Hyderabad and Rangareddy Districts------------------------------India continues to be polio free as the country has eradicated wild polio virus and the last case was seen on [13 Jan 2011], and it is more than 5 years that no wild polio virus has been detected.There have been some media reports that polio virus (P2 strain) has resurfaced in India for the 1st time in 5 years. However, it is not true as detected polio virus strain is vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) in a sewage sample collected near the Secunderabad railway station. However, no children have been found to be affected by the detected VDPV isolate in the nearby areas. Last case of Wild Polio Virus Type 2 in country was reported 17 years back in 1999. The detection of vaccine derived polio virus (VPDV) does not change the polio free status. It only indicates the robustness of the surveillance system and willingness of the country to detect any kind of polio virus even from the environment (sewage). Vaccine derived polioviruses are rare strain of the polioviruses that have genetically mutated from the strain contained in the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)A rapid surveillance review of the area revealed that the population immunity against polio type 2 is high as trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) was in use in the state until [24 Apr 2016] and 2 mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in January and February, 2016. As per recent sample survey in the area, 94 percent of children were found to have received at least 3 doses of OPV. Therefore, chances of its transmission in the concerned area are unlikely.However, as a precautionary measure against Polio, a special immunization drive is being held, covering high-risk areas of Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts, starting from [20 Jun 2016], where an estimated 300 000 children will be protected against polio using Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV). The special immunization campaign will ensure all vulnerable children living in high-risk areas are given protection against polio.As part of the special campaign being organized now, children between the age group of 6 weeks to 3 years will be given an additional dose of the injectable polio vaccine (IPV). Vaccination booths will be set up in the areas being covered in these campaigns. However, there will be no door-to-door vaccination campaign. Parents of children living in these areas will be encouraged to ensure that their children get the IPV dose from the nearest vaccination booth which will provide additional protection against all types of polio.The special campaign covering Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts is yet another evidence of India's strong commitment to remain polio-free. The last case due to wild poliovirus in India was detected on [13 Jan 2011] and the country was certified polio-free by WHO in March 2014. The polio-free certification pertains to the absence of wild poliovirus and thus country remains polio-free.India continues to maintain a highly sensitive surveillance system for polio. All cases of paralysis with sudden onset in children up to 15 years (which is called Acute Flaccid Paralysis or AFP) are picked up by the polio surveillance network. Each of these cases is followed up and their stool samples tested for poliovirus in WHO accredited laboratories. In addition, sewage samples are collected from over 30 sites spread across the country for poliovirus detection at regular intervals.Between Jan 2015 and May 2016, a total of 14 sewage samples collected from different parts of the country tested positive for VDPVs. All of these have been responded to urgently and appropriately with polio vaccination campaigns. None of these VDPVs detected in the sewage infected any children, so far.The response by the health authorities to the VDPV in Hyderabad is in accordance with World Health Organization protocols to mitigate any risk of spreading of the virus. WHO, UNICEF and Rotary are supporting Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in rolling out the polio campaign.Strong measures have been put in place in India to mitigate the risk of an importation and spread of poliovirus from countries with continued circulation of poliovirus. The country has done 2 nationwide polio campaigns this year. Polio vaccination is being carried out at international borders and is a must for people travelling to polio affected countries.The polio eradication program in India continues to protect children from the crippling disease by conducting 2 nationwide mass polio vaccination campaigns and 2 to 3 sub-national campaigns each year. Intensive efforts are also being undertaken in India to improve routine immunization coverage that involves administering polio vaccines, in addition to other vaccines, to infants under the Universal Immunization Program (UIP).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail would like to thank the EpiCore Surveillance Project members who rapidly replied to an RFI on this situation. The majority of the replies providing confirmatory information re: the identification of the VDPV2 (vaccine derived poliovirus type 2). The information provided in the above press release from the government puts this virus isolation in perspective. This was an environmental sample; to date there have been no cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with the VDPV2, but a cautionary vaccination campaign is being held in the surrounding area to ensure that the population is adequately immunized.A map of India showing states can be found at <http://www.prokerala.com/maps/india/india-map-political.html>.The HealthMap/ProMED map of India can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Global update - Polio Eradication InitiativeDate: 16 Jun 2016Source: Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>Polio eradication this week (as of 15 Jun 2016):Wild poliovirus type 1 and Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases:Total cases: YTD*-2016: WPV** / cVDPV*** // YTD*-2015: WPV** / cVDPV*** // Total in 2015: WPV** / cVDPV***Globally: 17 / 3 // 28 / 2 // 74 / 32- in endemic countries: 17 / 0 // 28 / 2 // 74 / 3- in non-endemic countries: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 29* YTD - year to date** WPV - wild poliovirus*** cVDPV - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirusCase breakdown by country:Countries: YTD-2016: WPV / cVDPV // YTD-2015: WPV / cVDPV // Total 2015: WPV / cVDPV // Onset paralysis most recent case: WPV / CVDPVAfghanistan: 6 / 0 // 2 / 0 // 20 / 0 // 29 May 2016 / NAPakistan: 11 / 0 // 24 / 2 // 54 / 2 // 26 Apr 2016 / 9 Feb 2015Guinea: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 7 // NA / 14 Dec 2015Lao PDR: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 8 // NA / 11 Jan 2016Madagascar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 10 // NA / 22 Aug 2015Myanmar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 5 Oct 2015Nigeria: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 1 // NA / 16 May 2015Ukraine: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 7 Jul 2015NA: onset of paralysis in most recent case is prior to 2015.Figures exclude non-AFP sources.Madagascar, Ukraine and Lao PDR cVDPV1, all others cVDPV2.cVDPV definition: see document ""Reporting and classification of vaccine-derived polioviruses"" at <http://www.polioeradication.org/Portals/0/Document/Resources/VDPV_ReportingClassification.pdf>.Implementation as of [15 Aug 2015].Afghanistan- 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the past week in Shigal Wa Sheltan district of Kunar with onset of paralysis on 29 May [2016]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is now 6 compared to 3 at this time last year.- No WPV1 environmental positive samples have been reported in 2016. The most recent environmental positive samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] - 1 in Jalalabad in Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.- Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) are planned for [18 - 22 Jul 2016] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV.) The next National Immunization Days (NIDs) will take place on [15 - 19 Aug 2016].Pakistan- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was from Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province with onset of paralysis on[ 26 Apr 2016]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 11, compared to 25 at this time in 2015.- No new WPV1 environmental positive samples were reported in the past week. The most recent positive sample was collected in Peshawar district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on [22 Apr 2016].- Efforts continue to further strengthen immunization and surveillance activities in all provinces of the country.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in 2016 remains 3 and 8 in 2015.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.- In Lao PDR the 2nd outbreak response assessment (OBRA) concluded that the country is on track towards interrupting virus transmission.- National Immunization Days using the bivalent oral polio vaccine are planned for [23 Jun - 1 Jul 2016].Madagascar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015] from Sud-Ouest region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 remains 10.- The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset of paralysis in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus.- The 3rd Outbreak Response Assessment in Madagascar found that the surveillance system is not yet strong enough to conclude that polio transmission has been interrupted. 39 high-risk districts have been identified to receive focused attention. Myanmar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case was isolated from a 16-month old child in Maungdaw, Rakhine, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015].

The most recent case was reported from Kankan district, with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 remains seven. The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset in August 2014.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in August [2016] in CÌ«te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) in Niger in September [2016] with dates to be confirmed. In October [2016], NIDs are planned in Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone, and SNIDs in Mauritania.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This week's global update has mostly good news with some news of caution. The good news is that Nigeria is approaching 2 years since the last case of wild poliovirus (WPV) associated polio occurred. The caution with respect to Nigeria is that the most recent isolation of a cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) was in March 2016, but genetic testing has it having been in circulation for almost 2 years without detection.Likewise, there have been no new cases confirmed in Pakistan this week making their current total of confirmed cases at 11 when compared with 25 at the same time last year (2015). In contrast, Afghanistan reported a new case with date of onset 29 May 2016, bringing the total number of cases reported in 2016 to 6 compared with 3 at the same time last year (2015). This may be good news as it may be a result of improved surveillance and case identification, or it may be cautionary news reflecting an increase in poliovirus transmission this year (2016).A map showing the worldwide distribution of WPV associated polio and cVDPV associated polio can be found at: <http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx>. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.]
