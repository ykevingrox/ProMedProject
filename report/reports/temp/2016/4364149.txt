It is a typical infection under poor hygienic conditions and could indicate that also human louse (_Pediculus humanus_, _P. h. capitis_) could be present. Scabies mites do not transmit diseases but the intense itching results in sores which may become infected. If lice are also present it opens up for transmission of _Rickettsia_, _Bartonella_ and _Borrelia_ infections.Chickenpox is an airborne, human-to-human transmitted disease with no zoonotic reservoir.Scabies is controlled by improving hygiene, washing clothes and treating with either an ointment containing deltamethrin or with Ivermectin.Chickenpox is difficult to control in a situation with many people living close together, and quarantine in a section of the camp, as described here, is probably the most effective measure. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3759>.]
