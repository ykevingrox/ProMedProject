Further analysis identified one isolate -- an _E coli_ 29957 strain -- as _mcr-1_- positive.In addition, that isolate was found to be resistant to all other classes of antibiotics tested against it, including beta-lactams [which included the carbapenems, ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem], fluoroquinolone compounds, and florfenicol. The authors of the study said this finding is particularly concerning.The _mcr-1_ gene was first reported late last year [2015] by researchers who found it in a strain of _E. coli_ bacteria identified in pigs, raw pork meat, and a handful of hospitalized patients in China. Since then it has been detected in bacteria from animals, humans, food, and the environment in at least 30 countries. A recent study out of Germany detected the _mcr-1_ gene in 402 out of 505 colistin-resistant _E. coli_ isolates [<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0159863>].The gene has raised alarms among public health officials because colistin is a powerful antibiotic that is used when bacterial infections -- such as Gram negative _E coli_ -- won't respond to other antibiotics. And because _mcr-1_ is located on mobile pieces of DNA known as plasmids, it can jump to different strains of bacteria and therefore has the ability to spread rapidly among both humans and animals.Of greatest concern is the potential for _mcr-1_ to latch onto multidrug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to infections that are nearly impossible to treat.The researchers said that the _mcr-1_ gene identified in the bovine _E. coli_ isolate was 100 per cent similar at the nucleotide level to the gene detected in China in November 2015 [<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=26603172&dopt=Abstract>].While the spread of colistin resistance and the MCR-1 gene has been well documented in animals, fewer human cases of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance have been reported. But the spread of the gene into the population is being carefully monitored.In a letter to the editor [<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/9/16-0177_article>], a team of Canadian researchers reported on a case involving a 61 year old man with drug resistant _E. coli_. Further analysis found that the _E. coli_ strain was resistant to colistin, and genome sequencing confirmed the presence of the _mcr-1_ gene [and the ESBL [extended spectrum beta-lactamases] gene _blaCTX-M-27_.]According to the report, the patient developed the infection at a Vancouver [Canada] hospital after undergoing a prostate procedure to treat obstructive urinary tract symptoms. The patient had also traveled to China in November 2015 and had been hospitalized for urinary retention while in the country. The researchers said this history suggested the _E. coli_ was likely acquired in the Chinese hospital, as the patient denied having any contact with farm animals, live-poultry markets, and undercooked food. The patient was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate [to which the isolate was found to be susceptible on in vitro testing] and was discharged from the hospital after 5 days. Other patients who shared a hospital room with the man were not screened.The researchers said that while retrospective screening has identified _mcr-1_ isolates in Canada, this is the 1st case of a patient being prospectively identified with _mcr-1_-harboring _E. coli_. They urged routine colistin testing for Enterobacteriaceae to get a better estimate on the real prevalence of _mcr-1_.[byline: Chris Dall]--communicated by:Philip HenikaUSDA [US Department of Agriculture]ARS [Agricultural Research Service]-Retired<philiphe@yahoo.com>[The _mcr-1_ gene, which was found in one isolate of fecal _E. coli_ in cattle in Europe reported above, was associated with resistance to carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem). The carbapenems are a group of beta-lactams that frequently retain activity against Gram negative bacilli that are resistant to other types of beta-lactam antibiotics. Clinically both the carbapenems and colistin have been one of a group of ""antibiotics of last resort"", used in situations in which the patient is seriously infected with an organism resistant to all antimicrobial drugs, except for these few drugs.Resistance to beta-lactams in many _mcr-1_-positive isolates has been found to be due extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs retain susceptibility to carbapenems. However, the concern is that the _mcr-1_ gene encoded on a mobile genetic element such as a plasmid could readily transfer colistin resistance to bacteria already resistant to all beta-lactams, including the carbapenems. In fact, a few _mcr-1_-positive isolates have been reported to be carbapenem-resistant, as was the _mcr-1_-positive isolate from cattle in the European study reported above. Although the mechanism for carbapenem resistance was not described in this study, usually carbapenem-resistance is due to the presence of genes that encode carbapenemases, which destroy the carbapenems, as well as most other beta-lactams. One such _mcr-1_-positive _E. coli_ isolated from a human wound infection in Germany was found to be a KPC-2 carbapenemase-producer (<http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(16)00009-8.pdf>). In another instance, an _mcr-1_-positive _E. coli_ isolated from a patient's urine was found to also carry the _blaVIM-1_ carbapenemase gene (<http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(16)00006-2/fulltext>). Also, ProMED-mail reported an OXA-181 carbapenemase-producing colistin-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ (see Antibiotic resistance - UAE: panresist. K. pneum, mobile chrom. colistin-resist. 20151126.3820586). - Mod.ML]
