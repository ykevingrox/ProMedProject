This individual also described possible HFMD in his child, and in other children in the resort.We wonder whether the broader ProMED community is aware of an ongoing HFMD outbreak in Caribbean resort areas. We believe that it would be important to identify such an outbreak, both because HFMD-linked viruses can cause more severe illness (such as encephalitis) and also because (as described below), the oral lesions that have been described with Zika virus infection may make this an important differential diagnosis.Case report-----------A 45-year-old man vacationed with his wife and 2-year-old daughter at a resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, from 22 Jan-1 Feb 2016. On 27 Jan 2016, he and his wife noticed that their daughter had developed a 'heat rash' described as red spots on her hands, feet, and back. Notably, they reported that there were at least 2 other children at the resort with a similar rash.On 28 Jan 2016, the man began to feel unwell, describing fever, nausea, headache, sore throat, and myalgia as his main symptoms. On 30 Jan 2016, he developed a rash, which appeared similar to his daughter's rash, on his hands, feet, buttocks, and in his mouth. His description suggests that the rash initially was comprised of erythematous papules and vesicles. Over the following days, the rash evolved and appeared as erythematous macules and patches, which appeared petechial [pinpoint red or purple spots] and purpuric [brownish-red spots].On 2 Feb 2016, he presented to an outpatient clinic in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On the basis of his clinical course, similar illness in children, and the appearance and progression of the rash he received a clinical diagnosis of HFMD. Serological evaluations, including antibody testing for chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses, were negative. Syphilis serology was negative. Stool PCR for enteroviruses was negative. The infectious disease consult service recommended that urine and pharyngeal specimens also be sent for viral studies, but this unfortunately was not done. In a follow up telephone discussion with a treating physician (24 Feb 2016) this individual indicated that he was recovering and his rash was resolving but stated that he was ""losing a layer or 2 of skin on [his] feet.""Comment-------While virological confirmation is lacking in this case, the clinical features and course of this illness are most consistent with HFMD. HFMD is most commonly observed in children under the age of 5, but there are several case studies and case series on this disease in adults. It is caused by enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus A71. It is transmitted through the fecal-oral route or by contact with fluid from the throat or vesicles. Its incubation period is usually 3 to 5 days. The virus is shed in the stool for 4 to 8 weeks [1].The disease may cause outbreaks; the 1st description of a HFMD outbreak was made in 1958, by investigators in Toronto, Canada [2].HFMD typically presents with a prodrome [early symptoms and signs indicating the onset of a disease] of non-specific symptoms that last 1 to 2 days, followed by a rash that lasts 7 to 10 days. The exanthem is usually a macular, maculopapular, or vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The enanthem is similar in the mouth.The disease may be complicated by meningitis, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, or myopericarditis. The diagnosis is made clinically, but PCR can be performed on samples from the throat, stool, urine, and vesicular fluid. Treatment is supportive [1].An epidemiological study of HFMD found no differences in either clinical presentation or enterovirus type between adults and children [3]. There have been 2 recent published HFMD case series about HFMD in adults caused by a less commonly isolated enterovirus, coxsackievirus A6 [4,5]. Some of the patients described in these case series presented similarly to the present case. Namely, their rashes appeared petechial and purpuric, with desquamation in affected areas about one month after rash onset.These case series suggested that the incidence of coxsackievirus A6 as a cause of HFMD is increasing in the adults, and that adults infected with coxsackievirus A6 may have atypical rash. The occurrence of HFMD in this individual with subsequent desquamation may suggest infection with coxsackievirus A6.The oral lesions observed in this instance were typical of HFMD. However, given the recent emergence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere, it is important to note that news reports described Zika virus presented as a febrile illness with rash and oral lesions during a recent outbreak in French Polynesia [6]. While this individual's serological evaluation was negative, the short time interval (5 days) between onset of symptoms and serological testing likely decreased the sensitivity of serological diagnosis.[We thank Dr John Brownstein of <http://healthmap.org> for useful discussions regarding oral lesions in Zika virus infection.]References----------1.

Other types of enteroviruses sometimes also cause hand-foot-mouth disease.ProMED-mail thanks Dr Fisman for submitting this interesting case report. It certainly emphasizes the problem of differential diagnosis of HFMD based on symptomatology alone with the emergence of Zika in the Americas. It also is an important report because it is not clear how extensive is the level of virus activity causing HFMD in Caribbean resorts, and non-polio enteroviruses have the potential to cause severe neurological disease. It will therefore be important for doctors to be aware of the similarities and differences between presentation of rash and oral lesions by Zika virus and the non-polio enteroviruses, as they may look vey similar. Laboratory assays will be important in distinguishing between these viruses. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Canada can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/274> and of the Dominican Republic at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32276>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJAs Dr. Fisman and colleagues have suggested, ProMED-mail would appreciate knowing if any of our readership is aware of a HFMD outbreak in the Caribbean or similar cases among tourists to that region. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32276>.][See Also:Hand, foot & mouth disease - Canada: ex Mexico (QR) resort 20160229.40576702015----Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (06): (HK) update, children residential home 20151202.3834826Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (05): (HK) update, school outbreaks, EV71 20151126.3821764Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (04): (HK) school outbreaks 20151118.3799693Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03): update 20151117.3797744Hand, foot & mouth disease - Oman 20151116.3794098Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02): treatment delay, RFI 20150916.3649429Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) school outbreak 20150927.3674603Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) police recruits 20150829.3609404Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (HK) 20150623.3459638Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20150121.31041442014----Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (02): (HK) 20140701.2580144Hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140630.2577434Herpangina & hand, foot & mouth disease - China: (Beijing) 20140623.2556756Hand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20140610.2530751Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (03) 20140608.2527551Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02) 20140518.2481104Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20140430.2440155Hand, foot & mouth disease - Cambodia 20140424.24274192013----Hand, foot & mouth disease - India: (MH) etiologic agents 20131128.2080891Hand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia: (SK) 20131009.1992927Hand, foot & mouth disease - China (03): (HK) increased incidence 20131005.1984319Hand, foot & mouth disease - Thailand 20130823.1898229and other items in the archives].................................................lk/mj/ml"
