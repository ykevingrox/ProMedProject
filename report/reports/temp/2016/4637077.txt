WMICentral [edited]<http://bit.ly/2f9uCOh>Rare illness emerges locally: acute flaccid myelitis----------------------------------------------------Two children hospitalized for over 3 months.Local [Navajo County, Arizona] health officials are investigating the possible cause of 2 cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare, non-contagious disease that mimics polio and is striking children nationwide.The condition attacks the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, ultimately causing paralysis. Symptoms include sudden weakness in one or more arms or legs, along with loss of muscle tone and decreased or absent reflexes. Numbness or other physical symptoms are rare, although some patients may have pain in their arms or legs.In some cases, dysfunction of the nerves controlling the head and neck, resulting in such features as facial weakness, difficulty swallowing, or drooping of the eyes, may accompany the limb.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says AFM-diagnosed patients' symptoms have been most similar to those caused by certain viruses, including poliovirus, non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and West Nile virus. Enteroviruses can cause neurologic illness, including meningitis.CDC confirms 37 AFM cases in the nation so far. Most patients are children. Two of the 9 patients in Arizona reside in Navajo County.Navajo County Public Health Nursing Supervisor Janelle Linn says the cause of the disease is unknown at this point and county nurses have been accompanying CDC on clinical interviews.The illness first saw an outbreak in August 2014 when CDC received increased reports of people with AFM for which no cause could be found. 89 ""sporadic"" CDC cases were reported in 33 states between 1 Jan and 30 Sep 2016 -- significantly higher than the 21 confirmed cases in 16 states in 2015.The illness baffled medical experts as reports of a ""mysterious polio-like illness"" have been in the headlines in recent weeks. DR, of Seattle [Washington state], died 30 Oct [2016] after being hospitalized for 2 weeks with paralysis. On 7 Nov [2016], the Washington State Department of Health announced its joint investigation into reports of 9 children who were admitted to Seattle Children's Hospital with acute neurologic illnesses. The department of health has confirmed 8 of the 9 children have AFM. A 9th child who died did not have AFM.The same day, a 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with AFM at a Portland, Oregon, children's hospital.Despite extensive testing, CDC officials do not yet know what led to an increase of AFM cases in 2016 and are unclear whether the disease results from a number of factors, including viral infections.""Some of these individuals are infected with [an] enterovirus [most often D68 - Mod.LK]. CDC thinks that may be a common cause, but they've been unable to rule it out,"" Linn said.Linn notes that the 2 Navajo County children diagnosed with AFM have been hospitalized under intensive care for more than 3 months.Linn said the risk of infectious diseases, such as occurrences of Zika virus seen in 2015, is expected to increase in Navajo County due to more frequent national and international travel.""We're seeing new diseases that we've never dealt with before,"" she said.CDC reminds the public to always practice disease prevention steps such as hand-washing, staying up-to-date on vaccines and protecting yourself from mosquito bites.[Byline: Nolan Madden]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko IizukaandProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] USA (Washington state)Date: Mon 14 Nov 2016Source: Seattle Times [edited]<http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/3-more-children-hospitalized-with-rare-polio-like-illness/>3 more children hospitalized with rare, polio-like illness----------------------------------------------------------Three more children in Washington have been hospitalized with symptoms of a rare, polio-like illness, state health officials said Monday [14 Nov 2016].If the new cases of suspected acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) are confirmed, they will bring the total in the state this fall to 11.The children are between the ages of 3 and 14 and all showed signs of weakness or paralysis in one or more limbs and distinctive spinal-cord changes that are required for a diagnosis of AFM, said Julie Graham, a spokeswoman for the Washington state Department of Health.""What's known about AFM is it's not subtle,"" Graham said. ""The reporting on it is likely to be fairly sufficient."" Two of the new cases are from King County and one is from Spokane County, Graham said. One of the King County cases was hospitalized at Seattle Children's and released, Graham said. The other King County child has been hospitalized at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma. The Spokane County child remains hospitalized there, Graham said.Of 8 children previously hospitalized at Seattle Children's, 6 have been released and 2 remain under care. The children fell ill starting in September [2016].Test results have been forwarded to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is responsible for confirming AFM cases. The agency has reported a sharp rise in AFM cases this year, with at least 89 logged in 33 states between January and September [2016]. A 12th child suspected of having AFM died, but he was excluded from the cluster. [A 6-year-old child from] Bellingham died 30 Oct [2016] of the results of severe brain swelling and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, after an illness with fever, according to a state death certificate issued 7 Nov [2016].The cause of AFM is unknown, though the illness has been associated with several viruses, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses and West Nile virus. It's very rare -- less than 1 case in every million people -- and affects children more often than adults.Cases can develop after a cold or other viral illness. There's no specific action that can prevent AFM, but the best precaution is to prevent illnesses associated with it through good hand hygiene, avoiding sick people and disinfecting surfaces frequently to stop the spread of germs.Some children paralyzed with AFM recover, but many do not, experts and families said. Two Washington state children were included in a nationwide rise of AFM in 2014, including [a 15-year-old child from] Bremerton, who is still grappling with the aftermath.[Byline: JoNel Aleccia]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko IizukaandProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There are 4 known cases in Oregon now. The total number of cases is lower than in 2014, but CDC is concerned with the recent increase in cases of AFM. A figure with known case numbers for 2014, 2015 and 2016 can be seen at <http://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/afm-surveillance.html>. Even with the increase in cases, the condition remains rare, less than one in one million. Enterovirus D68 is one cause of this illness, although AFM may follow other viral infections such as West Nile virus. If any reader has information on the etiology of this outbreak of AFM, ProMED would welcome hearing from you.
