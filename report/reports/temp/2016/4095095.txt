Official data show that since the 1st case was discovered in 2014 through today, 15 Mar 2016, China has reported 10 cases of human infection of H5N6 avian influenza virus with 5 deaths, The 1st case was reported in Sichaun province in April 2014, the 2nd in Guangdong province in December 2014, the 3rd and 4th, Yunnan province in 2015, and the remaining 6 cases in Guangdong province in December 2015- Mar 2016.
