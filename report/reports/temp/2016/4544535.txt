Haruna gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday [6 Oct 2016] in Dutse.""According to what we heard, 8 persons died in Niger Republic as a result of this disease. And because we share border with Niger, people from other states became disturbed and kept asking us about the measures taken about it. That is why we are warning people to be extra careful as regard to meats they eat. One must ensure that he consumes meat from animals slaughtered in the recognised abattoirs in the state,"" he advised.The official further advised people not to have direct contact with animals that are sick or dead, particularly cows, in order to lower their risk of contracting anthrax from such animals. According to him, the classical signs of the disease in cattle include blood coming from the nose, ear, mouth and anus when they died.Haruna said that people must also avoid contact with the blood of such animals, adding that such animals must be buried immediately [after] they die, and the blood stains be cleaned to avoid spread of the disease. ""To lower your risk of getting anthrax, do not eat meat that has not been properly slaughtered and cooked, do not work with raw animals' hides or skin, especially those of goats, sheep or cows,"" Haruna warned.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Jigawa is on the northern central border of Nigeria with Niger; see <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/NI/39/Jigawa.html> and checking with <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/niger_physio-2000.jpg> it is on the road from Magaria, Zinder, Niger, to Kano, Nigeria. Being on a main road increases the risk of contaminated meat being available in the local street markets.Assuming that the perceived risk is from anthrax cases in Zinder, my records show that Zinder in 2010 suffered 1 bovine outbreak with 1 case, and 2 sheep & goat outbreaks with 6 cases; 2011 (bovine 2, 4); 2012 (bovine 1, 80, and s&g 2, 9); 2013 (bovine 1, 9); no states identified in 2014; 2015 (bovine 4, 29, and s&g 7, 61). So Zinder is a significant risk to nearby Nigeria for exporting contaminated beef. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3412>.]
