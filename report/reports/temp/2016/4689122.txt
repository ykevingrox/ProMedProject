The agency issues an advisory whenever the figure reaches 8.9.This is the earliest such alert since the winter of 2010-2011, when it was issued in October. The number of patients per 1000 suspected of contracting influenza rose gradually from 4.5 on [6-12 Nov 2016] to 7.8 on [20-26 Nov 2016], before passing the warning level last week[week of 28 Nov 2016]. Influenza advisories are most commonly issued in January.In addition to cold-like symptoms, influenza is characterized by respiratory problems. To prevent flu, people are advised to wash their hands frequently and avoid crowded places.[Byline: Choi Won-woo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The surge in cases in recent weeks in Korea may be indicative of seasonal increases generally reported from most countries in the northern hemisphere. However, according to the last WHO global report on seasonal influenza (Influenza (47): Canada (YT), Reunion, WHO global update 20161129.4655906), influenza activity from most regions is fairly low at present. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195>.]
