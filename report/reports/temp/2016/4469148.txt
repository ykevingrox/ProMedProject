Mr Mogens LykketoftPresident, United Nations General Assembly UN Headquarters405 East 42nd StreetNew York, NY, 10017Dear Mr. President,The International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) is committed to improving the care of patients with infectious diseases and the control of infectious diseases around the world. The Society acknowledges infectious diseases cross all national and regional boundaries and that effective long-term solutions require international scientific exchange and cooperation.We recognize that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat, which endangers progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, we are extremely alarmed by the projected 10 million additional deaths per annum from antimicrobial resistant infections by 2050, and that the hammer blow will fall hardest on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa and Asia, ISID's core constituents.We applaud the decision by the UN Secretary General to hold an historic high-level meeting at this September's General Assembly to discuss AMR, and in so doing, acknowledging the need for a coordinated international response. We commend the work of Ambassador Juan Joseí  Goí mez Camacho of Mexico for coordinating this effort at the UN.ISID urges the Secretary General to ensure that concrete outputs are realized from this meeting. We join the call for the setting up of a high level coordinating mechanism (HLCM) chaired by the Executive Office of the Secretary General, to allow inter-agency coordination across the UN system, and between all relevant UN organizations, the tripartite alliance (WHO-OIE-FAO) and specialized agencies. We ask that this body be tasked with clear goals, including the setting of targets for antimicrobial consumption and resistance, in addition to financing, and an accountability mechanism to ensure that goals will be met.We at ISID are committed to work in support of the UN and the international community on AMR. We have a global network in excess of 81 000 international practitioners in LMICs to support development and delivery of global and context-specific public awareness campaigns and clinical guidelines, to facilitate collection of antimicrobial use and resistance data, and to join others in developing clinical trial networks to test new antimicrobials, diagnostics and vaccines.With deepest respect,Sincerely,Jon Cohen, MD ISID PresidentMarc Mendelson, MD ISID President-elect Miguel O'Ryan, MDISID External Affairs CommitteeCc: Permanent Representative of Mexico, Ambassador Juan Joseí  Goí mez Camacho; Director- General Margaret Chan, World Health[We want to make our readers aware of ISID's efforts to control AMR. We at ProMED applaud and support these efforts. Antimicrobial resistant pathogens represent a major emerging infectious threat and we at ProMED will expand our efforts to report them. - Mod.LM].................................................lm/ao/dk"
