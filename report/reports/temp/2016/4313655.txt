Medical Daily [edited]<http://www.medicaldaily.com/seagulls-mcr-1-gene-drug-resistant-superbug-390609>Superbugs are a growing public health concern in the United States. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 2 million people are infected with antibiotic-resistant infections each year, 23 000 of whom will die as a result. Now, scientists worry seagulls, a wild bird that has an ""enormous migratory reach,"" could make matters worse.The authors of a new study published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy have found a highly drug-resistant form of _Escherichia coli_ in bird droppings they sampled in Lithuania [extract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw245.extract>] and Argentina [extract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw262.extract>]. This form of _E. coli_ is marked by the _mcr-1_ gene, which is what makes it resistant to the powerful, ""last-resort antibiotic"" called colistin. Study authors believe that the seagulls picked up the superbug after eating sewage or medical waste.""The lifestyle of gulls allows them to carry and disseminate pathogenic and resistant microorganisms despite country borders,"" the researchers wrote, according to Newser. ""Water contaminated by feces of birds should be foreseen as important risk factor for transmission of resistant bacteria."" Because these are migratory birds, Newser added that they serve as great vehicles for spreading the deadly drug-resistant bacteria around the world -- the fear of every scientist.Drug resistance occurs when microbes such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites evolve over time. It adapts to the environment in a way that enables species to reproduce, thrive, and spread quickly and efficiently. Antibiotics work to stop bacterial infections by hindering their ability to grow, but if the microbes undergo genetic changes that allow them to thrive regardless, then prescribing antibiotics is useless. Part of the reason for resistance has to do with overprescribing antibiotics in the 1st place -- the more people take a certain medication, the less effective it is.While colistin is widely used in animal production it's becoming increasingly popular in human medicine due to the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria that cause potentially deadly infections, like pneumonia. Its use, though, is still limited, ""which is why it's still powerful enough to kill many stubborn bacteria,"" Fortune reported.That said, in 2013, there was one case of colistin in a pig living in Shanghai. Since this announcement, scientists all over the world have examined their collection of bacterial isolates to see whether they contain the _mcr-1_ gene. Newser cited at least 100 cases of colistin resistance in nearly 24 countries, including bacteria that were in storage for at least 5 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tested more than 55 000 samples of bacteria they collected from humans, animals, and food for the gene, finding it in just 2 samples from pigs slaughtered in Illinois and South Carolina, according to Fortune.It's not just animals. In May [2016], a 49-year-old woman in Pennsylvania seeking treatment for a urinary tract infection became the 1st person in the US to become infected with colistin-resistant bacteria. While she has recovered from the infection, she, like the seagulls, is still a carrier for the superbug.According to The National Geographic, colistin resistance can lurk in the gut bacteria, mainly _E. coli_, for an unknown period of time. It's possible someone can carry the superbug without knowing it and pass it on to others. This gene can go undetected until someone develops an infection.Officials are currently on alert, continuing to track down this colistin-resistant strain and building a surveillance system to help locate and hopefully contain it.[Byline: Jaleesa Baulkman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 24 Jun 2016Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/06/mcr-1-findings-gulls-show-mobility-resistance-threat>The feared antibiotic resistance factor mcr-1 has been found in seagulls in Argentina [extract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw262.extract>] and Lithuania [extract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw245.full>], raising the possibility that migratory birds may further spur the already global spread of the threat, according to 2 of a flurry of mcr-1 reports released this week.Besides the seagulls, scientists have found mcr-1 in bacteria from hospital patients in Ecuador [abstract available at <http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10376899>] and Poland [extract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw261.extract>], sick chickens in China [extract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw243.extract>], and meat samples in Portugal [extract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw240.extract>], according to the new reports in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (JAC) and Epidemiology and Infection.The reports underline once again the hitchhiking prowess of the MCR-1 resistance gene. Scientists say the gene, if it teams up with certain other resistance genes, could render bacteria resistant to all existing drugs.[The _mcr-1_  gene] confers resistance to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic for drug-resistant infections. The gene was first detected in China in November 2015, and since then at least 20 countries have reported it, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the United States, _mcr-1_ was found in _Escherichia coli_ from a Pennsylvania woman in May [2016] and also was found recently in stored _E. coli_ samples from 2 pigs.Instead of being anchored to a bacterial chromosome, the _mcr-1_ gene is carried on a plasmid, a ring of DNA that can pass between different bacterial species. In most cases the gene has been found in _E. coli_, but it also has been detected in _Salmonella_, _Shigella sonnei_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_.In one of the JAC reports, Lithuanian researchers said they found the _mcr-1_ gene in _E. coli_ from 1 of 117 fecal and cloacal samples collected in January 2016 from European herring gulls that frequented a garbage dump in the city of Kaunas. They found that the isolate was resistant to ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam as well as colistin, but was susceptible to all other antibiotics tested. They billed the discovery as the 1st known occurrence of the _mcr-1_ gene in _E. coli_ carried by a wild migratory bird, to the best of their knowledge. Gulls that were ringed in Lithuania have later turned up in nearly all European countries, showing the extent of their migrations, the researchers said.They commented that inappropriate management of medical, biological, and food waste may contribute to the spread of infectious agents by wild birds, especially gulls, adding, ""Water contaminated by faeces of birds should be foreseen as an important risk factor for transmission of resistant bacteria.""The other seagull find involved Kelp gulls in Argentina, according to European researchers writing in JAC [abstract available at <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/jac.dkw262.extract>]. In surveillance in 2012 for bacteria with extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance (ESCR), the team collected 50 fecal samples from Kelp gulls in Ushuaia, Argentina. 5 _E. coli_ isolates from the samples showed colistin resistance, and the _mcr-1_ gene was detected in all 5. The discovery was the 1st detection of _mcr-1_ in Kelp gulls, as best they could determine. The authors also observed that _mcr-1_ has rarely been found in any wild animals, which don't naturally come into contact with antibiotics. ""The fact that gull species migrate, sometimes even between continents, indicates that they may play a role in the global dissemination of these clinically relevant bacteria,"" the authors said.In Ecuador, an _E. coli_ isolate from a 14-year-old boy who had an appendectomy was found to have the _mcr-1_ gene, marking its 1st appearance in the Andean region of South America, according to a report in Epidemiology and Infection.The researchers, from 2 universities in Quito, said necrotic areas were found during the boy's appendectomy, so peritoneal fluid samples were taken and cultured. The samples yielded a colistin-resistant _E. coli_ isolate, and molecular analysis confirmed the presence of the _mcr-1_ gene. The isolate was susceptible to carbapenem, amikacin, and gentamicin but resistant to tigecycline, ciprofloxacin, and cephalosporins.The isolate was identified as sequence type 609, a strain that was previously found in rooks in Poland, glaucous-winged gulls in Russia, dog feces in Denmark, and a patient in Canada, the authors said.They judged that the strain was probably part of the boy's normal gut bacteria. It is suspected, they said, that the spread of mcr-1 bacteria is the result of the use of polymyxins, the drug class that includes colistin, in livestock, and polymyxins are approved for veterinary use and in food animals in Ecuador. The patient reported frequent trips to an intensive livestock production area, and those trips probably contributed to his exposure to the mcr-1 _E. coli_ strain, the researchers said.Possible exposure to livestock is also mentioned in a JAC report of mcr-1 in a Polish patient. Colistin-resistant _E. coli_ was found last October [2015] in the urine of a woman in her 50s who had pneumonia, diarrhea, and a urinary tract infection. She had no recent travel history, but she lived in a rural area, suggesting possible contact with livestock, the authors said.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing confirmed mcr-1 in the woman's isolate, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that it was resistant to 8 classes of antibiotics but susceptible to 4, the report says.It notes that Poland's national laboratory began surveillance for colistin-resistance in 2014. Of 37 Enterobacteriaceae isolates submitted for testing by the end of 2015, the woman's _E. coli_ isolate was the only mcr-1 producer.""Even though fragmentary, the patient's data correspond to the hypothesis that an agriculture associated _mcr-1_ reservoir exists,"" the researcher said, adding that _mcr-1_ is known to have been present in European livestock for more than 10 years. ""The isolate characteristics accord with the growing knowledge on _E. coli_ as the major _mcr-1_ host and the high genetic diversity of mcr-1 -positive isolates,"" they concluded.In another JAC report, Chinese researchers said they found 4 MCR-1 producing _Salmonella_ isolates from sick chickens. The detections resulted from a surveillance program for chicken _Salmonella_ strains that carry another resistance factor, extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). Under the program, 53 ESBL-positive _Salmonella_ isolates were collected from diseased chickens in eight Chinese provinces in 2014 and 2015. 4 of these were positive for mcr-1. In one isolate, a _Salmonella enterica_ strain from Sichuan province, both _mcr-1_ and one type of ESBL gene, called _bla_CTX-M-55, were found on a single plasmid. This find, together with other data from sequencing of the entire plasmid, ""indicates that the genetic environment of the _mcr-1_ gene is more mobile than we expected,"" the authors said. They said it appears that mcr-1 easily coexists with ESBL genes. ""The coexistence of _mcr-1_ and _bla_CTX-M genes on a single plasmid presents more severe challenges in terms of controlling the election and transmission of mcr-1,"" they added.""Strong evidence exists for the ongoing transmission of mcr-1 on a global scale and its co-occurrence on plasmids with _bla_CTX-M genes. This evidence is of gave concern and merits immediate action to limit the selection and transmission of _mcr-1_ in order to preserve the efficacy of polymyxins,"" the report concludes.In Portugal, a survey of the antibiotic susceptibility of _Salmonella_ in retail meat samples collected in 2011 and 2012 led to the detection of mcr-1, according to still another JAC report. Of 258 _S. enterica_ samples, 37 showed colistin resistance, and testing of these revealed that 4 -- all the Typhimurium serotype -- were positive for mcr-1. One of the isolates contained the ESBL factor CTX-M-1. The authors were able to identify the _mcr-1_-containing plasmids in 2 of the isolates but couldn't identify those in the other 2, an observation ""that supports the diversity of genetic platforms of _mcr-1_ with the ability to disseminate,"" they wrote. The geographic origins of the samples were unknown, and they might have included meat from various sources, the report says.""It is obvious that _mcr-1_ is present in different plasmids and appears to have inserted into different genetic environments, factors that may impact its spread geographically,"" the researchers said. ""Hence more genome data should be generated to fully understand the threat of a rapid widespread distribution. Nevertheless, our Â ndings, and those of others, call for immediate action at an international level on the use of colistin in animal production.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The _mcr-1_ gene encodes resistance to colistin, one of the antibiotics of ""last resort"". Because the _mcr-1_ gene is located on a plasmid, it is capable of horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria of the same or even different species, and is frequently linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other antibiotics (such as, the extended-spectrum cephalosporins). It has been identified worldwide and in current isolates, as well as in stored samples of _E. coli_ collected several years ago. It is now reported in migratory wildlife (gulls).
