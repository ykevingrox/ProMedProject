New York Times [edited]<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/13/health/polio-vaccination-africa-nigeria.html>Polio response in Africa to be fast, difficult and possibly dangerous---------------------------------------------------------------------The counterattack against resurgent polio in Africa will be rapid, logistically difficult and potentially dangerous, involving millions of doses of vaccine, thousands of vaccinators and the health ministries and militaries of 5 countries, experts from the World Health Organization and other groups say.Stopping the disease in Africa is crucial to the high-stakes effort to eradicate it from the world, a campaign that has been pressed for almost 30 years and has consumed billions of dollars.After 2 years with no cases in Africa, experts were elated at the imminent taste of victory on the continent, considered the toughest front in the fight against infectious diseases. Those hopes were dashed this week when 2 new cases were discovered. Now Nigeria rejoins Pakistan and Afghanistan on the list of countries where the disease has not been completely eliminated.To contain the virus before it spreads out of Borno State in Nigeria, where both paralyzed children were found last month [July 2016], a 1st round of vaccinations will begin as early as next week. Five more rounds will take place over the coming months in ever-widening circles that ultimately encompass the entire Lake Chad basin in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Cameroon and the Central African Republic.""Although this is a setback and a disappointment, polio eradication is still absolutely feasible and on track,"" said Michel Zaffran, the new WHO chief of polio eradication. He acknowledged, however, that ""it is still very tricky in some areas.""Veterans of the polio eradication effort expressed confidence that the disease's spread in Africa would ultimately be halted because north east Nigeria is gradually becoming safer and because outbreaks in other treacherous regions, including Somalia and Syria, have been suppressed in recent years.Although only 2 paralyzed children were found, the fact that families in separate towns, Jere and Gwoza, each had a strain of the virus last identified in Borno State 5 years ago suggests that it has circulated the whole time and that there may be many more hidden cases. Only about one infection in 200 produces paralysis, and other disabled children may have been overlooked in the fighting and panicky flights of people in north eastern Nigeria for some years. The effort faces several major obstacles, experts said.Until recently, the threat of ambushes by Boko Haram, the vicious Islamic fundamentalist militia that has massacred and kidnapped hundreds, made about 80 per cent of Borno's roads too dangerous for vaccination teams, except for sporadic ""hit and run"" efforts targeting individual villages during periods of relative calm. Now, after a long and bloody campaign by the Nigerian Army in cooperation with the militaries of neighboring states, almost all Borno villages can be reached -- sometimes routinely, sometimes at least briefly with military escorts, said Dr Tunji Funsho, the head of Nigeria's Rotary International polio committee, which helps coordinate the campaign.Areas that have been off limits to vaccinators for several years are thought to have once contained about 200 000 children under age 5, said Michael Galway, head of polio operations in Nigeria for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Those children may have never had a single vaccine dose.There is no accurate estimate yet of the number of children in the vast areas the campaign hopes to sweep through in the next 4 months, Mr Zaffran of WHO said.Also, while most of Borno State is populated by the Kanuri people, who are historically sedentary, engaging in farming, fishing, salt-processing and trade, many hundreds of thousands of residents were displaced by Boko Haram raids. Now, after living for months or years in camps for people uprooted by the violence or in the state's better-protected major cities, people are starting to head back home in some areas. Mobile populations are hard to vaccinate, experts said, and protecting a child against polio takes several doses spaced 3 or more weeks apart.Also, the region is crossed by the nomadic Fulani people, who drive their cattle hundreds of miles and across multiple borders in search of water and grass; they rarely visit health clinics and are even harder to track. To reach people on the move, the campaign uses several techniques. Some teams with refrigerated supplies of vaccine are permanently on call, ready to go out when migratory people congregate for cattle markets, tribal festivals or at border posts. Other vaccinators may accompany veterinarians who go out to vaccinate cattle. Also, the campaign sets up ""health camps"" to attract nomads. Nurses offer prenatal medical care, vitamins, food, and shots against measles, diphtheria, tetanus and other diseases besides polio. ""It would be immoral to just offer people 2 drops of polio vaccine and move away,"" said Dr Elias Durry, the WHO emergency adviser for polio for the eastern Mediterranean who spent years overseeing polio campaigns in Africa.In other respects, battling polio in Borno State may be easier that it was in north west Nigeria, the source of Africa's last multiyear outbreak, or in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In both those places, the campaign was crippled by widespread rumors -- promulgated by some local imams -- that the vaccine was a western plot to sterilize Muslim girls, or that it contained pork products or the virus that causes AIDS. In Borno, by contrast, Dr Funsho said, both religious leaders and average residents accept the vaccine.The 2 Nigerian cases were discovered in part because of the army's conquests, experts said. They were found in families that had returned home from unsafe areas. The hunt for paralysis cases intensified last spring after a dangerous mutant strain of the vaccine virus was found in Borno sewage samples. It was a strain that had last been seen in Chad; since many Nigerians fled across the Chad border, experts theorized that it had come back in a family that had felt safe enough to return.[byline: Donald G McNeil]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A more extensive background on the civil unrest in the region and the impact it has had on routine immunization activities.

Now it will have to vaccinate millions of kids. Nigeria has reported the 1st 2 cases of polio after more than 2 years, in an area newly liberated from Islamic extremists who attacked polio vaccinators in the past, the government and WHO said on Thursday [11 Aug 2016] Two children have been diagnosed with polio paralysis in Nigeria. It's a major setback to the international effort to eradicate the disease, which health authorities thought they had sequestered into only Pakistan and Afghanistan.The news was announced by WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] on Thursday [11 Aug 2016], a day that would otherwise have marked the 2-year anniversary of Africa's last case of polio. If Thursday had come and gone without any cases being discovered, that would have triggered a 12 month countdown to the entire continent's being certified free of polio, a crucial step in the almost 30 year battle to wipe the disease from the world.""This is a setback, definitely, these 2 cases that have been detected after 2 years of what we thought was a Nigeria free from polio,"" Michel Zaffran, a physician who is WHO's director of polio eradication, said in a briefing Friday [12 Aug 2016] morning. ""This is a true disappointment.""Before Thursday [11 Nov 2016], only 19 cases of naturally occurring polio had been found in 2016, all in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the international effort by WHO, CDC, and Rotary International has been concentrating eradication efforts. The partners will now have to mount multiple emergency vaccination campaigns to immunize millions of children in the area where the cases were found: Borno state, Nigeria's most north eastern province, which shares borders with Niger and Cameroon and is across Lake Chad from Chad.Zaffran said Friday [12 Aug 2016] that there will probably have to be 6 separate rounds of vaccination covering northern Nigeria and neighboring countries, including Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and the Central African Republic. The 1st, in Borno, should begin next week, he said. ""This is a major response to what we consider a major threat to the polio eradication initiative,"" he said.WHO said genetic analysis of the virus from the 2 children and their families, who live in different parts of Borno, reveals that it is most like a strain collected in Borno in 2011. That implies polio has never been eliminated from the region but instead was circulating silently, even though Nigeria had not detected any polio cases anywhere in the country since July 2014. The brutal math of polio epidemiology -- experts consider that only one in every 200 cases is detected -- makes it likely that polio could be present throughout the area.Borno state is also one of Nigeria's most unstable areas. It's the home territory of Boko Haram, the fundamentalist terrorist militia that may be best known for kidnapping 276 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok. Boko Haram has conducted a sustained campaign of bombings and slaughters that's estimated to have killed 20 000 people in 7 years, and has destabilized all of north eastern Nigeria.It's not unusual for internal conflict in a country to interfere with polio eradication; in Pakistan, the Taliban has persistently attacked teams of vaccinators. But, until recently, Boko Haram's violence made parts of Borno state no-go areas even for Nigeria's military. Nigeria's health minister, Isaac Adewole, said in a statement that the cases were found because military action took back portions of Borno state from the militants, allowing ""strengthened surveillance.""John Vertefeuille, an epidemiologist who is CDC's polio eradication branch chief and formerly ran the agency's Nigeria office, said the part of the country where the cases were found poses unique challenges for reaching children and keeping vaccinators safe. ""The Lake Chad region is complicated, because the lake itself grows and shrinks, and it is hard even to estimate the number of island communities -- some of which are formal communities, and some of which move around following crop seasons and the water needs of their livestock,"" he said.""Then put on top of that, Boko Haram has created such a situation of insecurity that the government of Nigeria declared a national emergency for Borno and (neighboring) Yobe state that has been in place ever since. There are many instances in which Boko Haram has gone in, taken over a town, displaced the population -- who had to move to an internal resettlement camp or outside the country or resettle with family or friends -- and destroyed the hospitals and schools.""Ongoing security challengesNigeria's place in the international polio fight has been a complicated one. In 2003, religious leaders in north-central Kano state commanded followers to stop accepting polio vaccine, claiming the formula had been contaminated in a Western plot against Islamic children. That put a stop to vaccination in northern Nigeria for more than a year, long enough for polio not only to surge back there, but also to leak across borders and seed the disease in 14 other African countries.Rates of vaccination remained low for years, which allowed what is called a ""vaccine-derived virus"" -- a random mutation of the weakened vaccine strain back to the virulence of natural polio -- to bloom into an epidemic in 2006. Those political divisions were eventually healed and the country recommitted to polio eradication -- to the point, Vertefeuille said, that the new cases were found because a Nigerian task force was already in the field, tracking down an alert over a possible vaccine-derived strain.""Nigeria's ability to respond to polio has changed dramatically from the old days,"" he said. ""I want to say strongly that I believe the Nigerian polio response will be able to effectively handle this."" But the security challenge posed by Boko Haram is going to continue to make the task difficult, he warned. ""It will require a lot of special effort, and linkage to the security forces and really constantly reading the data. So when there are opportunities, they are able to move in quickly and get vaccine in there and get back out if the situation changes again.""[byline: Maryn McKenna]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[An excellent review of the historic and present day challenges faced by Nigeria in eradicating polio.

These steps include conducting large-scale immunization campaigns and strengthening surveillance systems that help catch the virus early. These activities are also being strengthened in neighboring countries.""We are deeply saddened by the news that 2 Nigerian children have been paralyzed by polio. The government has made significant strides to stop this paralyzing disease in recent years. The overriding priority now is to rapidly immunize all children around the affected area and ensure that no other children succumb to this terrible disease,"" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.Genetic sequencing of the viruses suggests that the new cases are most closely linked to a wild poliovirus strain last detected in Borno in 2011. Low-level transmission of the poliovirus is not unexpected, particularly in areas where it is difficult to reach children with the vaccine. Subnational surveillance gaps persist in some areas of Borno, as well as in areas of neighbouring countries.On the brink of polio eradication""We are confident that with a swift response and strong collaboration with the Nigerian government, we can soon rid the country of polio once and for all. This is an important reminder that the world cannot afford to be complacent as we are on the brink of polio eradication -- we will only be done when the entire world has been certified polio-free,"" said Dr Michel Zaffran, director of polio eradication at WHO headquarters.As recently as 2012, Nigeria accounted for more than half of all polio cases worldwide, but the country has made significant strides, recently  marking 2 years without a case on [24 Jul 2016]. This progress has been the result of a concerted effort by all levels of government, civil society, religious leaders and tens of thousands of dedicated health workers. Recent steps including increased community involvement and the establishment of Emergency Operations Centers at the national and state level have been pivotal to Nigeria's capacity to respond to outbreaks.The 2 cases in Nigeria particularly highlight the need to prioritize immunization of children in hard-to-reach areas such as the Lake Chad region, which spans several countries and is often affected by conflict and large population movements. Reaching these children requires vaccinating populations as they move in and out of inaccessible areas and using local-level groups and organizations, such as religious institutions and community based organizations, to negotiate access for vaccination teams.Globally, the world is very close to reaching the goal of polio eradication. Only 21 wild polio cases have been reported so far in 2016, compared to 34 cases at the same point last year. Only 2 other countries are reporting polio: Pakistan and Afghanistan. Four out of the 6 WHO Regions of the world have been certified polio-free, and only one of the 3 types of wild poliovirus is still circulating in the world (type 1).For further information, please contact:Tarik JaÁarevià <jasarevict@who.int>Fadela Chaib <chaibf@who.int>Christian Lindmeier <lindmeierch@who.int>--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[The HealthMap/ProMED map of Nigeria can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62> and of Borno State, Nigeria at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/621>. - Mod.MPP]******[5] Global update - Polio Eradication InitiativeDate: Thu 11 Aug 2016Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>Polio eradication this week (as of 10 Aug 2016):Wild poliovirus type 1 and Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases:Total cases: YTD*-2016: WPV** / cVDPV*** // YTD*-2015: WPV** / cVDPV*** // Total in 2015: WPV** / cVDPV***Globally: 19 / 3 // 36 / 12 // 74 / 32- in endemic countries: 19 / 0 // 36 / 3 // 74 / 3- in non-endemic countries: 0 / 3 // 0 / 9 // 0 / 29* YTD - year to date** WPV - wild poliovirus*** cVDPV - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirusCase breakdown by country:Countries: YTD-2016: WPV / cVDPV // YTD-2015: WPV / cVDPV // Total 2015: WPV / cVDPV // Onset paralysis most recent case: WPV / CVDPVAfghanistan: 6 / 0 // 7 / 0 // 20 / 0 // 29 May 2016 / NAPakistan: 13 / 0 // 29 / 2 // 54 / 2 // 18 Jun 2016 / 9 Feb 2015Guinea: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 7 // NA / 14 Dec 2015Lao PDR: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 8 // NA / 11 Jan 2016Madagascar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 9 // 0 / 10 // NA / 22 Aug 2015Myanmar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 5 Oct 2015Nigeria: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 1 // NA / 16 May 2015Ukraine: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 7 Jul 2015NA: onset of paralysis in most recent case is prior to 2015.Figures exclude non-AFP sources.Madagascar, Ukraine and Lao PDR cVDPV1, all others cVDPV2.cVDPV definition: see document ""Reporting and classification of vaccine-derived polioviruses"" at <http://www.polioeradication.org/Portals/0/Document/Resources/VDPV_ReportingClassification.pdf>.Implementation as of [15 Aug 2015].Highlight/headlineIn Nigeria, wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) has been detected from Borno state. Virus was isolated from 2 local government areas (LGA) of Borno; in Gwoza LGAs, in a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP -- onset of paralysis on [13 Jul 2016]) and close healthy contacts of that child; and in Jere from a close healthy contact of a child who had developed AFP symptoms on [6 Jul 2016]. Both cases are reported by 'advanced notification' this week and will be reflected in the official data next week.It is the 1st WPV1 detected in Nigeria since July 2014. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses suggest they are most closely linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection since that time.An outbreak response plan is currently being finalized, consisting of 3 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), the 1st one beginning within 2 weeks and subsequent rounds being conducted at short intervals (of between 2 to 3 weeks).Afghanistan- No new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis in Shigal Wa Sheltan district of Kunar province on 29 May 2016. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 6 compared to 7 at this time last year.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for [22-26 Aug 2016] and [3-7 Oct 2016] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV).Pakistan- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in South Waziristan district of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), with onset of paralysis on [18 Jun 2016]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 13 compared to 29 at this time in 2015.- One new WPV1 environmental positive sample was reported in the past week in Sindh province in Karachi-Baldia district, collected on [14 Jul 2016].- Efforts continue to further strengthen immunization and surveillance activities in all provinces of the country.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3 in 2016 and 8 in 2015.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.- The 2nd outbreak response assessment (OBRA) concluded that the country is on track towards interrupting virus transmission. Lao's next Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) is scheduled for [15-19 Aug 2016].Madagascar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015] from Sud-Ouest region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 was 10.- The 2015 cases are genetically linked to a case with onset of paralysis in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus.- The 3rd Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) in Madagascar found that the surveillance system is not yet strong enough to conclude that polio transmission has been interrupted. Thirty-nine high-risk districts have been identified to receive focused attention.- Madagascar's next Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) is scheduled for [19-30 Aug 2016].- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for [9-11 Nov 2016] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV).Myanmar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case was isolated from a 16 month old child in Maungdaw district of Rakhine state, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 is 2.Nigeria- In Nigeria, wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) has been detected from Borno state. Virus was isolated from 2 local government areas (LGA) of Borno; in Gwoza LGAs, in a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP - onset of paralysis on [13 Jul 2016]) and close healthy contacts of that child; and in Jere from a close healthy contact of a child who had developed AFP symptoms on [6 Jul 2016].- It is the 1st WPV1 detected in Nigeria since July 2014. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses suggest they are most closely linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection since that time.- An outbreak response plan is currently being finalized, consisting of 3 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), the 1st one beginning within 2 weeks, and subsequent rounds being conducted at short intervals (of between 2 to 3 weeks).West Africa- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district, with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2016]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is 7. The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset in August 2014.- An Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) is under way in Guinea to assess progress towards stopping the transmission of VDPV2.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from [30 Sep 2016 to 3 Oct 2016]. NIDs are also planned in Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone from [28-31 Oct 2016]. SNIDs are planned in Mauritania and Niger from [28-31 Oct 2016]. A circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strain was detected in Borno, Nigeria on [23 Mar 2016], which may have circulated without detection for a prolonged period somewhere in the sub-Region -- either in Nigeria or in adjacent countries of the Lake Chad region. Due to this, synchronised Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) using mOPV2 are taking place in Cameroon, Chad and Niger on [19-21 Aug 2016 and 9-11 Sep 2016].- The director general of WHO approved release of the vaccine from the mOPV2 stockpile for these campaigns. This aims to boost immunity against type 2 VDPVs across the broader Lake Chad region as well as within Nigeria.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Overall, there appears to be significant progress towards the goal of polio eradication, with numbers of reported cases markedly reduced from last year and all prior years since the initiative began. That being said, the occurrence of 2 cases of paralytic disease related to WPV1 that has most likely been in circulation undetected for the past 5 years in Borno, Nigeria is a major setback -- highlighting the challenges presented by areas with civil unrest and disruption of the health infrastructure in these regions. In the case of Nigeria, as previously noted, the affected area is the area considered to be where insurgents are sequestered, and normal activities such as vaccination have been seriously disrupted. Other areas similar to this exist elsewhere in the world, and one can't help but view declarations of WPV transmission interruption in such areas cautiously.A very sad state of affairs when public health measures have been interrupted and blocked due to political and civil unrest.A map showing the worldwide distribution of polio cases can be found at <http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx>. - Mod.MPP]
