Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, much has been done to further understand the biology of the Ebola virus, yet a number of people in West Africa displayed VHF-like symptoms while testing negative for Ebola.What is it that caused some people to display VHF symptoms without having the Ebola virus, and what role might that have in worsening the clinical outcome and survival rates of those infected with Ebola? What other pathogens may have been lingering in the background and how may these have affected the patient's immune response to fight infection?These questions will be addressed by a research study carried out at Public Health England and Plymouth University School of Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences, with support for a PhD post from Public Health England.]13 Dec 2016: Persistence of Ebola virus RNA in seminal fluid<http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(16)30243-1/fulltext?elsca1=etoc>[Citation.Sissoko D, Durrafour S, Kerber R. (January 2017). Persistence of Ebola virus RNA in seminal fluid. The Lancet Global Health. 5(1): e12-e13, January 2017. DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30243-1>Summary---------Background-----------By January 2016, all known transmission chains of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa had been stopped. However, there is concern about persistence of Ebola virus in the reproductive tract of men who have survived EVD. We aimed to use biostatistical modelling to describe the dynamics of Ebola virus RNA load in seminal fluid, including clearance parameters.Methods--------In this longitudinal study, we recruited men who had been discharged from 3 Ebola treatment units in Guinea between January and July 2015. Participants provided samples of seminal fluid at follow-up every 3-6 weeks, which we tested for Ebola virus RNA using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Representative specimens from 8 participants were then inoculated into immunodeficient mice to test for infectivity. We used a linear mixed-effect model to analyse the dynamics of virus persistence in seminal fluid over time.Findings--------We enrolled 26 participants and tested 130 seminal fluid specimens; median follow up was 197 days (IQR 187-209 days) after enrolment, which corresponded to 255 days (228-287) after disease onset. Ebola virus RNA was detected in 86 semen specimens from 19 (73%) participants. Median duration of Ebola virus RNA detection was 158 days after onset (73-181; maximum 407 days at end of follow-up). Mathematical modelling of the quantitative time-series data showed a mean clearance rate of Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid of 58 log units per month, although the clearance kinetic varied greatly between participants. Using our biostatistical model, we predict that 50% and 90% of male survivors clear Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid at 115 days (90% prediction interval 72-160) and 294 days (212-399) after disease onset, respectively. We also predicted that the number of men positive for Ebola virus RNA in affected countries would decrease from about 50 in January 2016, to fewer than one person by July 2016. Infectious virus was detected in 15 of 26 (58%) specimens tested in mice.Interpretation------------Time to clearance of Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid varies greatly between individuals and could be more than 13 months. Our predictions will assist in decision-making about surveillance and preventive measures in EVD outbreaks.][If detection of RNA is indicative of transmissibility of infectious virus, this makes control of spread of Ebola virus very difficult. - Mod.LK]13 Dec 2016: CID: Ebola virus persistence in breast milk after no reported illness: a likely source of virus transmission from mother to child<https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/conte....full.pdf+html>[Citation.Daouda S, Keita M, Diallo B. (Dec 2016). Ebola virus persistence in breast milk after no reported illness: a likely source of virus transmission from mother to child.Abstract [edited]-----------A 9-month-old infant died from Ebola virus (EBOV) disease with unknown epidemiological link. While her parents did not report previous illness, laboratory investigations revealed persisting EBOV RNA in the mother's breast milk and the father's seminal fluid. Genomic analysis strongly suggests EBOV transmission to the child through breastfeeding.][And yet another transmission risk. But it would be difficult to stop the practice of breast feeding, nor would one want to, unless the mother was infected with Ebola virus. In this case, it is not clear whether the mother was asymptomatic or didn't pay attention to the symptoms. - Mod.LK]Funding----14 Dec 2016 USA: Omaha's experience treating Ebola leads to federal funds, enhanced training opportunities<http://netnebraska.org/article/news/1053601/omahas-experience-treating-ebola-leads-federal-funds-enhanced-training>[Two years after patients with Ebola virus disease [(EVD)] arrived in Omaha for treatment, the University of Nebraska Medical Center [UNMC] continues to refine procedures for handling patients with dangerous diseases. The experience has paid off in significant ways.In November [2016], UNMC was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to host a multi-million dollar training facility [scheduled to open in 2018] on its campus for government workers responding to disease outbreaks anywhere in the world. In addition, the hospital's biocontainment unit recently conducted a major drill on behalf of the U.S. Department of State to practice evacuation of simulated EVD patients from Africa.][The training of health care workers in proper handling of patients with highly infectious diseases is critical to their safety and that of the public. - Mod.LK]14 Dec 2016 Sierra Leone: Waste sector reform project kicks off<http://awoko.org/2016/12/14/sierra-leone-news-waste-sector-reform-project-kicks-off/>[According to the Minister of Local Government and Rural Development, Maya Moiwo Kaikai: ""Waste management poses a serious challenge to government's development aspirations. Even though the country has a National Integrated Waste Management Plan, implementation has been a serious challenge. Governments, past and present have grappled with the numerous socioeconomic and political problems of waste management. The streets of the 3 cities continue to be littered with unmanageable waste, adding to the health hazards in the cities.""[All health hazards challenge the immune system and make the population more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease (EVD). -
