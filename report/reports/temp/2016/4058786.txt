WHO [edited]<http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-17-february-2016>Summary-------Human-to-human transmission directly linked to the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa was declared to have ended in Sierra Leone on 7 Nov 2015. The country then entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance to ensure the rapid detection of any further cases that might arise as a result of a missed transmission chain, reintroduction from an animal reservoir, importation from an area of active transmission, or re-emergence of virus that had persisted in a survivor.On 14 Jan 2016, 68 days into the 90-day surveillance period, a new confirmed case of EVD was reported after a post-mortem swab collected from a deceased 22-year-old woman tested positive for Ebola virus. On 20 Jan 2016, the aunt of the index case developed symptoms and tested positive for Ebola virus. The aunt was in a voluntary quarantine facility at the time she developed symptoms, after previously being identified as a high-risk contact. On 4 Feb 2016, the aunt of the index case provided a 2nd consecutive Ebola-RNA-negative blood sample and was discharged. All contacts linked to the 2 cases had completed follow-up by 11 Feb 2016. Efforts to locate several untraced contacts in the district of Kambia [Sierra Leone] will continue until at least 24 Feb 2016. If no further cases are detected, transmission linked to this cluster of cases will be declared to have ended on 17 Mar 2016.Human-to-human transmission linked to the most recent cluster of cases in Liberia was declared to have ended on 14 Jan 2016. Guinea was declared free of Ebola transmission on 29 Dec 2015 and is approximately halfway through a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance that is due to end on 27 Mar 2016.With guidance from WHO and other partners, ministries of health in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have plans to deliver a package of essential services to safeguard the health of the estimated more than 10 000 survivors of EVD and enable those individuals to take any necessary precautions to prevent infection of their close contacts. Over 300 male survivors in Liberia have accessed semen screening and counselling services. In addition, over 2600 survivors in Sierra Leone have accessed a general health assessment and eye exams.To achieve the 2nd key Phase 3 response framework objective of managing residual Ebola risks, WHO has supported the implementation of enhanced surveillance systems in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to enable health workers and members of the public to report any case of febrile illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD. In the week to 14 Feb 2016, 1251 alerts were reported in Guinea from all of the country's 34 prefectures. The vast majority of alerts (1241) were reports of community deaths. Over the same period, 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 316 new and repeat samples (18 samples from live patients and 298 from community deaths) from 17 of the country's 34 prefectures. In Liberia, 877 alerts were reported from all of the country's 15 counties, most of which (719) were related to live patients. The country's 5 operational laboratories tested 924 new and repeat samples (789 from live patients and 135 from community deaths) for Ebola virus over the same period. In Sierra Leone, 1872 alerts were reported from the country's 14 districts. The majority of alerts (1500) were for community deaths. 978 new and repeat samples (37 from live patients and 941 from community deaths) were tested for Ebola virus by the country's 7 operational laboratories over the same period [all evidently negative for Ebola, and impractical for reasons of lab capability and cost to test for other causes - Mod.JW].The deployment of rapid-response teams following the detection of a new confirmed case continues to be a cornerstone of the national response strategy in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Each country has at least one national rapid-response team, with strengthening of national and subnational rapid-response capacity and validation of incident-response plans continuing throughout 2016.Figure 1: Confirmed, probable, and suspected EVD cases worldwide [see source above][Note: lab confirmation = Guinea 88 percent, Liberia 30 percent, Sierra Leone 62 percent. - Mod.JW]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] ResearchDate: February 2016From: Malcolm G Semple <m.g.semple@liverpool.ac.uk> [edited]Study on persistent symptoms in Ebola survivors-----------------------------------------------Thousands of persons have survived Ebola virus disease. Almost all survivors describe symptoms that persist or develop after hospital discharge.We wish to report a peer reviewed publication of a cross-sectional survey of the symptoms of all survivors from the Ebola treatment unit (ETU) at 34th Regimental Military Hospital, Freetown, Sierra Leone (MH34), which was conducted at their initial follow-up appointment after discharge within 3 weeks after their 2nd negative PCR result.From its opening on 1 Dec 2014 through 31 Mar 2015, the MH34 ETU treated 84 persons (8-70 years of age) with PCR-confirmed Ebola virus disease, of whom 44 survived. Survivors reported musculoskeletal pain (70 per cent), headache (48 per cent), and ocular problems (14 per cent). Those who reported headache had a lower admission cycle threshold Ebola PCR than did those who did not [indicating a lower viral load. - Mod.JW]Ref: Scott JT, Sesay FR, Massaquoi TA, Idriss BR, Sahr F, Semple MG: Post-Ebola syndrome, Sierra Leone.

There is no licensed treatment or vaccine against the virus, underscoring the need for efficacious countermeasures. Here, we demonstrate that a human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit Ebola virus disease outbreak maintained circulating antibodies against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein for more than a decade after infection. From this survivor we isolated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that neutralize recent and previous outbreak variants of Ebola virus and mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Strikingly, monotherapy with mAb114 protected macaques when given as late as 5 days after challenge. Treatment with a single human mAb suggests that a simplified therapeutic strategy for human Ebola infection may be possible.""Citation:Misasi J, Gilman M, Masaru K, et al: (25 Feb 2016).

Here, we demonstrate that mAb100 recognizes the base of the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) trimer, occludes access to the cathepsin-cleavage loop, and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of GP that is required for virus entry. We show that mAb114 interacts with the glycan cap and inner chalice of GP, remains associated following proteolytic removal of the glycan cap, and inhibits binding of cleaved GP to its receptor. These results define the basis of neutralization for two protective antibodies and may facilitate development of therapies and vaccines.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>.
