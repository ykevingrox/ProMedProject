Classified as a secondary household contact.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It appears as though there is now significant MERS-CoV transmission ongoing in Riyadh with the confirmation of 5 newly infected individuals in the past 24 hours. Of the newly infected individuals, 2 are healthcare workers and 3 are household contacts. Yesterday, there was a report of a newly confirmed case in Saudi Arabia in a 49 year old Saudi female who was reported to be in critical condition. Other newly confirmed cases reported in Riyadh Saudi Arabia in the past 14 days include an 85 year old female reported on 3 Jun 2016 (reported to be in stable condition) and a 54 year old Saudi male in Alkharj (77kms or 48mi from Riyadh) reported to be in stable condition. Of note, all 3 prior cases were classified as primary infections, 1 with a definite history of camel exposure in the 14 days preceding onset (the 54 year old male from Alkharj) , 1 with no known camel exposure (the 49 year old Saudi female), and 1 whose history of camel exposure was under investigation (the 85 year old female). While all 5 newly reported cases were listed as being in stable condition, looking at the Saudi MOH website, there is mention of an increase in asymptomatic cases by 5, suggesting that these 5 individuals are currently asymptomatic and MERS-CoV identification was done as part of contact tracing.Clarification of the status of these cases would be greatly appreciated as well as identification of the index case in this cluster.The location of Riyadh can be found on a map of Saudi Arabia at the source URL.
