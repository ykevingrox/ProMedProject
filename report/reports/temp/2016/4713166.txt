Infants less than age 1 are less likely to be affected due to passive protection from maternal antibodies, if she [the mother] has adequate immunity,"" Dr Holland said.""The mumps virus is highly contagious and transmitted via spread of respiratory droplets. Transmission is most common among those living or congregating in close quarters (that is, dormitories, grade schools, sports teammates). The average incubation period is between 16-18 days, but may range from 12-25 days.""Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and decreased appetite. These symptoms typically precede the classic symptom of swelling of the salivary glands by 3-5 days. Approximately 20 percent of people do not develop symptoms after infection, so awareness of possible exposure is very important.""It's important to practice good, frequent handwashing,"" said Emily Carroll, director of the Navarro County Health Department. ""It's also important for people to check their immunization records. For more information, the Department of State Health Services website is <http://www.dshs.texas.gov>.Diagnostic testing is performed by obtaining a cheek swab for isolation of the virus (recommended) or viral antibody testing. Mumps may also be diagnosed by classic exam findings identified by your primary care provider. Treatment includes supportive care measures, including rest and OTC (over the counter) medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) for fevers and pain.Although most people who contract mumps make a full recovery, it is such a public health concern due to serious complications including meningitis, deafness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and orchitis (inflammation of the testicles). Vaccination is highly recommended for prevention.Since the advent of the mumps vaccine, the number of mumps cases has decreased in the US by over 99 percent. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that children receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine between ages 12-15 months and 4-6 years. This vaccine also helps protect against measles and rubella, and 2 doses are 88 percent effective against the spread of the mumps virus. Even if your child has missed a dose, your primary care provider can administer the vaccine by ""catch-up"" immunization schedules. Pregnant women should not receive the MMR vaccine. Adequate immunity against mumps is also important for those who travel internationally.If you feel that you have these symptoms, contact your primary care provider prior to your appointment to ensure that proper control and safety measures are taken to prevent the spread of the disease to others.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.

Health officials have tracked the strain to an initial outbreak at an Iowa college. They say 12 new cases were reported last week [week of 12 Dec 2016].""Mumps has a long incubation period, around 12-25 days, so we could see an upsurge next week. We're just going to keep doing what we know to do, until it goes away,"" said Dr Nate Smith, Director and State Health Officer at the Arkansas Department of Health.The Health Department says mumps has spread from Arkansas to Texas and Oklahoma. The Marshallese population in Northwest Arkansas has been especially hard-hit. About 60 percent of the region's cases have affected people in that community.[Byline: Ellen Lampe]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Arkansas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208>.
