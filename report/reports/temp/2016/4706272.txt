The Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/japanese-encephalitis-vaccination-time-period-extended-in-malkangiri/articleshow/56011761.cms>The Malkangiri district administration extended the programme of vaccinating children in the age group of 1-15 against Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus till 24 Dec [2016].Earlier, the administration had declared to continue the special vaccination programme, which was launched on 5 Dec-15 Dec [2015].As many as 18 027 children aged between 1-15 have been identified for vaccination from across the district during the 3-day door-to-door survey conducted by the administration from 21 Nov [2016].Till 14 Dec [2016], around 90 percent of the children were vaccinated against JE. To ensure that all the children are vaccinated, the programme has been extended, said ADMO (public health) K K Sakar.The administration has formed 175 teams to carry out the vaccination work, and the entire process is being monitored by 87 supervisors.As many as 32 children have succumbed to JE in the district since 8 Sep [2016], and 90 children have died due to non-JE disease, which the doctors identified as acute encephalitis syndrome [AES].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although about 1/3rd of the encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections, it is good to learn that the special vaccination program is underway. AES remains to be dealt with. An early study by a team led by Dr. Jacob John implicated the consumption of toxic _Cassia occidentalis_ seeds by children as the likely cause of AES in this outbreak, although some local health officials doubted that the seeds were responsible for the AES (non-JE but without specific diagnosis). Because no new cases of either JE or AES were reported above, perhaps this outbreak has ended.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]
