The Columbian Blogs [edited]<http://blogs.columbian.com/healthbeat/2016/01/27/gonorrhea-reaches-outbreak-levels-in-clark-county/>Clark County (Washington State) is currently experiencing a gonorrhea outbreak. Dr Alan Melnick, county health officer, said Clark County Public Health recorded 94 cases of the sexually transmitted disease during the 4th quarter of 2015. That pushed the county past the outbreak threshold of 82 cases. In all of 2015, Clark County recorded 246 cases of gonorrhea. The 5-year average is about 170 cases, according to public health.Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that grows easily in the warm, moist areas of the reproductive tract in women and in the urethra in men and women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria can also grow in the mouth, throat, eyes and anus, according to the CDC.It is unclear why the local case numbers are rising, but Melnick wonders whether advances in HIV treatment have made people less vigilant about using condoms.Public health staff interviewed those who were diagnosed with gonorrhea in late 2015 and learned that 18 percent were using methamphetamine. That doesn't necessarily mean meth use led to the increase, Melnick said, but it's a factor health officials plan to keep an eye on. Of the 94 cases, Melnick said 96 percent received treatment.Despite the increase in gonorrhea, infection rates for other sexually transmitted diseases remain steady, Melnick said.This isn't the 1st time Clark County has seen a jump in gonorrhea numbers. The county experienced an outbreak in 2014, when 208 cases were recorded.[Byline: Marissa Harshman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The ability of a pathogenic microorganism, like _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, to selectively adhere to the surface of only certain types of host cells determines its sites of pathology. Gonococci selectively adhere to columnar epithelial cells, that is, epithelial cells that are taller than they are wide, of the urethra, endocervix, conjunctivae, rectum, and pharynx and cause disease at these sites (such as, urethritis, cervicitis, conjunctivitis, proctitis, and pharyngitis, respectively).We are not told in the news report above where in Clark County cases of gonococcal disease occur. Clark County, with a population of 425 363 in 2010, is located in the southwestern part of the US state of Washington, on the north side of the Columbia River, across from the city of Portland (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Washington>). Portland is the capital and largest city (with an estimated population of 619 360 in 2014) in the US state of Oregon (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon>). The city of Vancouver is the county seat of Clark County, with about 40 percent of the Clark County's population. Vancouver is located directly north of Portland and is connected to Portland by 2 bridges. A map of this region can be found at <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Clark+County,+WA/>.Increase in gonococcal disease in Oregon was previously reported to be occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM), which is similar to the situation in many other jurisdictions in the US and other countries; see a ProMED-mail post (Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect 20140608.2527642). This article posted by ProMED-mail reported that ""HIV-infected gay men often choose HIV-positive partners to avoid using condoms, but they still can transmit STDs."" The outbreak among MSM has been characterized by high rates of HIV coinfection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm>), and use of smartphone apps like Grindr, a gay social networking site.Discussions of gonococcal infection can be found in my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail post below. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4647>.]
