Several cases of a diarrheal illness called Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ -- or ""STEC"" -- [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli,_ EHEC - Mod.LL] have been reported in Washington County, the county's Department of Health and Human Services said on [Wed 17 Aug 2016]. No sources have been identified, but public health officials said that livestock at the Washington County Fair may have been a cause, as well as food items brought to the fair from outside.According to Washington County, anyone who attended the Washington County Fair and has had, or develops, symptoms of stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting ,or fever, should call their health care provider. ""This type of infection is highly contagious even when symptoms are mild,"" Deputy Health Officer Christina Baumann said. ""To prevent the spread of disease, people with diarrhea should stay home while sick and avoid handling food or preparing food for others.""A small number of people infected with EHEC may develop a life-threatening complications form the disease, said Wendy Gordon, spokeswoman for the Washington County Department of Health and Human Services. Young children are at the highest risk for this complication.""The best way to prevent getting STEC infection is by washing hands well with soap and water,"" Baumann said. ""It's very important to wash your hands after using the bathroom or changing diapers, before preparing or eating food, and after contact with animals or their environments at farms, petting zoos and fairs.""EHEC outbreaks at fairs are not uncommon, Gordon said, and with several county and state fairs still to come this season, fairgoers should take the following precautions to keep themselves and their children healthy:- do not put anything in your mouth in the animal areas, including food, beverage, pacifiers, toys or hands;- leave any unnecessary items outside the animal areas;- be aware that objects such as clothing, shoes and strollers can be contaminated with bacteria in the animal areas;- wash your hands regularly- be sure to supervise your children to make sure they are washing their hands well.[Byline: Geoff Pursinger]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Oregon can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19828>.

Findings in both outbreaks were animal contact at farms open to the public and inadequate hand washing (14,16). In the Pennsylvania outbreak, 51 persons (median age: 4 years) became ill within 10 days of visiting a dairy farm, and 8 (16 percent) developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal consequence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection. The same strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from cattle, case-patients, and the farm environment. In addition to the reported cases, an increased number of diarrhea cases in the community were attributed to visiting the farm. An assessment of the farm environment determined that 1) no areas existed for eating and drinking that were separate from the animal contact areas, and 2) the limited hand-washing facilities were not configured for children (14).Failure to properly wash hands was also a contributing factor in other outbreaks caused by _Cryptosporidium_ (11) and _Salmonella_ (12). The protective effect of hand washing and the persistence of organisms in the environment were demonstrated in an outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections at a Colorado zoo. 65 cases (the majority of them children) were associated with touching a wooden barrier around the Komodo dragon exhibit. Non infected children were substantially more likely to have washed their hands after visiting the exhibit. _Salmonella_ was isolated from 39 case-patients, a Komodo dragon, and the wooden barrier (12).During 2000-2001 at a Minnesota children's farm day camp, washing hands with soap after touching a calf and washing hands before going home were protective factors in 2 outbreaks involving multiple enteric organisms (50). A total of 84 illnesses were documented among attendees. Implicated organisms for the human infections were _E. coli_ O157:H7, _Cryptosporidium parvum_, non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (EHEC), _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium, and _Campylobacter jejuni_. These organisms, as well as _Giardia_, were also isolated from the calves. Risk factors for children included caring for an ill calf and getting visible manure on their hands.Enteric pathogens can contaminate and persist in animal housing areas. For example, _E. coli_ O157:H7 can survive in soil for months (31,32,34,51). Prolonged environmental persistence of pathogens was documented in an Ohio outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 infections in which 23 persons became ill at a fair after handling sawdust, attending a dance, or eating and drinking in a building where animals were exhibited during the previous week (31). 14 weeks after the fair ended, _E. coli_ O157 was isolated from multiple environmental sources within the building, including sawdust on the floor and dust on the rafters. 42 weeks after the fair ended, _E. coli_ O157 was recovered from sawdust on the floor.Transmission of _E. coli_ O157:H7 from airborne dust was implicated in an Oregon county fair outbreak with 60 cases, the majority of them children (18). Illness was associated with visiting an exhibition hall that housed goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits, and poultry but was not associated with touching animals or their pens, eating, or inadequate hand washing. The same organism was recovered from ill persons and the building. In 2004, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection was associated with attendance at a goat and sheep petting zoo at the North Carolina State Fair (51). Health officials investigated 112 case-patients, including 15 who had HUS. The same strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infecting case-patients was isolated from the animal bedding 10 days after the fair was over. The strain was also isolated from the soil after the animal bedding was removed.The effect of improper facility design was illustrated by one of the most substantial waterborne outbreaks in the United States (28,29). Approximately 800 suspected cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 and _Campylobacter_ were identified among attendees at a New York county fair where the water and sewage systems had deficiencies.Sporadic infections-------------------Multiple sporadic infections, not identified as part of recognized outbreaks, have been associated with animal environments. A study of sporadic _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections among selected US states and counties determined that case-patients, especially children, were more likely to have visited a farm with cows than healthy persons (52). Additional studies also documented an association between _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection and visiting a farm (53) or living in a rural area (54). Studies of human cryptosporidiosis have documented contact with cattle or visiting farms as risk factors for infection (55-57). A case-control study identified multiple factors associated with _Campylobacter_ infection, including raw milk consumption and contact with farm animals (58). In other studies, farm residents were at a lower risk for infection with _Cryptosporidium_ (55) and _E. coli_ O157:H7 (59) than farm visitors, probably because the residents had acquired immunity to the infection as a result of their early and frequent exposure to these organisms."" - Mod.LL]
