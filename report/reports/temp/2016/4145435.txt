Anyone who ate at the Royal Indian Cuisine, 7610 Pacific Ave., [Stockton, CA] between 5 and 10 pm on 22 Mar is asked to contact Public Health Services at (209) 468-3822.Measles is highly contagious. People don't have to come into direct contact with someone with the disease but need to merely be around them. It spreads through the air. Anyone who has had measles or a measles shot is unlikely to become sick. But those who have not had measles or a vaccine are highly susceptible. They can spread it to friends and family members before they even know they are ill.Last year [2015], more than 100 people became ill from measles after someone who was contagious went to Disneyland. The person who ate in the restaurant in Stockton is the only known case of measles in California, and officials hope the disease will not spread.Measles can be serious. It usually begins with a fever as high as 105 deg F [approx 40 deg C], cough, runny nose and red eyes. These symptoms are followed by a rash that starts at the head, spreads to the chest and then the legs. Anyone who has these symptoms should stay home and away from other people, since they are likely to spread the disease. They also should call county Public Health Services immediately. Those who require medical attention should call the healthcare facility before heading there so measures can be taken to prevent the disease's spread.The outbreak of measles last year stoked debate on vaccinations. One study, since debunked by dozens of further studies, said childhood vaccines could be linked to higher rates of autism, and scores of parents have decided not to vaccinate their children. Most medical officials have said the risk of complications from vaccines is so much lower than the risk of complications from illnesses, such as measles, that they recommend children get them. State laws enacted last year require vaccinations for children who go to public schools with very few exceptions. And an outbreak at a Nevada City school last week caused the school's temporary closure. It's an area among the lowest vaccination rates in California, according to officials.A story published in the Journal of the American Medical Association [15 Mar 2016] said a review of 18 measles studies and 32 pertussis (whooping cough) studies found that children whose parents intentionally did not have them vaccinated contribute to disease outbreaks. The story did say other factors are likely at work, as well, but cited the rise in rates of both highly contagious diseases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report states it is the only known case of measles in California.

The unvaccinated child lives in Nevada County [California] and contracted measles after returning to California after travelling overseas. Public Health reports that the child has recovered but residents of Amador and Calaveras have been exposed.""The people exposed to the child with measles have tested negative for the disease. At this time no Calaveras county residents have contracted measles"" said Dr Kelaita. ""It is very concerning to receive a report of a child with measles traveling through our community because we have seen a decrease in the numbers of children protected with vaccinations in Calaveras"".Kelaita said that measles is a highly contagious, viral disease that is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms begin with a fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, followed by a rash that typically appears on the face along the hairline or behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body. An infected individual is contagious from four days before the rash starts to four days after the rash appears. Public Health reports that measles symptoms can include diarrhea, ear infections and pneumonia, and that severe complications can be fatal.A total of 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine [MMR] are recommended for school-aged children. The 1st dose is given at 12 -- 15 months of age. The 2nd dose is usually given at 4--6 years of age. Anyone travelling internationally outside the United States should ensure they have received full measles vaccination.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The child referred to in the report may be the same child from Nevada County, CA, with measles, reported in a previous ProMED-mail Measles update (07): USA (CA) Africa (Liberia, Chad), UK corr. 20160330.4128525, however that is not clear. - Mod.LK]******[3] Australia (Sydney): measlesDate: Thu 7 Apr 2016Source: news.com.au, Daily Telegraph report [edited]<http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/measles-alert-for-sydney-after-four-cases-detected/news-story/98bb05e86ca188f9621a7d17d98272bb>Measles alert for Sydney after 4 cases detected--------------------------------------------Children are particularly at risk from measles. NSW [New South Wales] Health has issued a warning after it was discovered 4 people with measles spent time in Western Sydney and Sydney's North Shore while infected with the ""highly contagious disease"".Of the cases, 2 were travellers who had also spent time in hostels in Cairns and Magnetic Island in Far North Queensland while infectious. The pair then travelled to Sydney from Cairns separately on Virgin Airlines on 28 Mar [2016] and Tiger Airlines the next day [29 mar 2016]. One of the infected people later checked in to the Royal North Shore Hospital's emergency department on 29 Mar [2016].A NSW Health statement said the other 2 cases were young children who had probably acquired the infection in India, before flying to Sydney on flight AI302 from Delhi on 30 Mar [2016]. They were taken to a medical centre in Blacktown and later Mt Druitt Hospital on 2 Apr [2016].NSW Health has urged anyone who has not received 2 doses of measles vaccine and come into contact with any of the sick patients to come forward. ""The measles virus is highly contagious and is spread through the air by someone who is unwell with the disease,"" Communicable Diseases Branch's Dr Vicky Sheppeard said. ""If you develop the symptoms of measles, seek medical advice. Please call ahead to your doctor or emergency department so that arrangements can be made to keep you away from others to minimise the risk of infection"".""Measles is highly contagious and is spread through coughing and sneezing. For young children, the measles vaccine is recommended at 12 months and again at 18 months of age. 2 doses of the vaccine are required for lifelong protection."" Symptoms include fever, sore throat and eyes and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by red, blotchy rashes spreading from the head and neck down. The disease is very infectious and can have serious health complications, especially for young children.The warning follows a warning last week after an infectious person attended the Queen Victoria Building, Pitt St Mall and Sydney's international airport.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases. The virus is spread from an infectious person during coughing or sneezing or through direct contact with secretion from the nose or mouth. A person is infectious for 5 days before the onset of the measles rash, and about 4 days after the rash appears.The Australian Measles Control Campaign was initiated in August 1998 as part of the World Health Organisation's global Measles eradication program, and in response to major epidemics in Australia throughout 1994-1995, together with a report predicting another impending measles epidemic in Australia. The campaign vaccinated 1.78 million children, making it the largest national vaccination campaign conducted in Australia since the introduction of poliomyelitis vaccination in 1956.As a result of this campaign, Australia experienced a 96 percent fall in reported measles cases after 5 years, from 836 in 1997 to 32 in 2001. Endemic Measles was declared eradicated from Australia in February 2009.References----------Gilbert, GL; Escott RG; Gidding HF; et al.:""Impact of the Australian Measles Control Campaign on immunity to measles and rubella"".
