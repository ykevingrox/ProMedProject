NEJM. 2016; [Epub ahead of print] DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1604037. PMID: 27305043.BackgroundColombia began official surveillance for Zika virus disease (ZVD) in August 2015. In October 2015, an outbreak of ZVD was declared after laboratory-confirmed disease was identified in 9 patients.MethodsUsing the national population-based surveillance system, we assessed patients with clinical symptoms of ZVD from 9 Aug 2015, to 2 Apr 2016. Laboratory test results and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated for a subgroup of pregnant women. Concurrently, we investigated reports of microcephaly for evidence of congenital ZVD.ResultsBy 2 Apr 2016, there were 65 726 cases of ZVD reported in Colombia, of which 2485 (4 percent) were confirmed by means of reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The overall reported incidence of ZVD among female patients was twice that in male patients. A total of 11 944 pregnant women with ZVD were reported in Colombia, with 1484 (12 percent) of these cases confirmed on RT-PCR assay. In a subgroup of 1850 pregnant women, more than 90 percent of women who were reportedly infected during the 3rd trimester had given birth, and no infants with apparent abnormalities, including microcephaly, have been identified. A majority of the women who contracted ZVD in the 1st or 2nd trimester were still pregnant at the time of this report. Among the cases of microcephaly investigated from January 2016 through April 2016, 4 patients had laboratory evidence of congenital ZVD; all were born to asymptomatic mothers who were not included in the ZVD surveillance system.ConclusionsPreliminary surveillance data in Colombia suggest that maternal infection with the Zika virus during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy is not linked to structural abnormalities in the fetus. However, the monitoring of the effect of ZVD on pregnant women in Colombia is ongoing.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Zika complications USADate: 16 Jun 2016Source: CIDRAP [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/06/zika-complications-seen-6-us-pregnancies-so-far>Stepping up the level of detail in its reporting on Zika infections in pregnant women, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today started announcing poor birth outcomes from US states, noting 6 instances of birth defects -- 3 involving live births.In a related development, a Spanish team today reported the details of a congenital Zika infection in the fetus of a woman who had been infected with the virus in Venezuela.3 live births among 6 poor outcomes-----------------------------------The CDC has been gradually ramping up the information it shares on Zika infections in pregnant women. On 20 May [2016] it announced a change in the way it reports the number of Zika infections in pregnant women to include those with lab-confirmed asymptomatic illnesses, which it said provides a more complete picture of the impact of the disease on pregnant women. At the time, CDC officials said they held off on reporting birth defect numbers because of incomplete details and privacy concerns.The numbers it released today, based on information as of 9 Jun [2016], are from one of the CDC's 2 Zika pregnancy registries: the one that pertains to women in US states and the District of Colombia, which reflects travel-related cases. The CDC added that in the coming weeks it will report poor pregnancy outcomes from the 2nd registry, the one that tracks Zika infections in US territories.So far 3 US infants have been born live with Zika related birth defects, a group of conditions that include microcephaly, other brain abnormalities, eye problems, and a host of nerve, muscle, and joint issues. 3 women infected with Zika virus have had pregnancy losses --miscarriages, stillbirths, and abortions-- with birth defects. The cases are from 234 US women who have had any lab evidence of possible Zika virus infection as of 9 Jun [2016]. During the same timeframe, 189 infections in pregnant women have been reported from the US territories, according to a CDC update yesterday [15 Jun 2016].Officials declined to break down the poor pregnancy outcomes by state due to privacy issues, but some details about some cases are already known, such as severe microcephaly in a baby born to a Hawaiian woman who had spent time in Brazil and a baby born recently to a Honduran woman in a New Jersey hospital.In February [2016], the CDC published a report on a range of outcomes in 9 pregnant travelers from the United States who had lab-confirmed Zika infections. [Of these] 2 women had miscarried in their 1st trimester, 2 women had abortions, 2 pregnancies were continuing without any known complications, and, of 3 live births, only one had microcephaly --presumably the baby born in Hawaii.In today's case update, the CDC included a caveat: though the poor outcomes occurred alongside lab evidence of Zika infection, it's not known whether the defects were caused by Zika virus or other factors.Congenital Zika case in Spain-----------------------------The report on the Zika-related congenital malformations detected in Spain was published today in the latest edition of Eurosurveillance. The authors said the problems were found when the woman in her 20s visiting from Venezuela was admitted to a hospital in March for routine follow-up when she was 17 weeks pregnant.The patient said she had experienced a rash in January, and an ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation was normal. Exploring the possibility of Zika virus infection, Spanish clinicians confirmed recent Zika virus infection on serology and molecular tests. Ultrasound done at 19 weeks showed fetal hydrocephalus and extensive muscle and joint problems. Tests on amniotic fluid detected Zika RNA, but ruled out other infections.Due to severe malformations and brain problems in the fetus, the woman had an abortion at 21 weeks gestation. Autopsy confirmed the musculoskeletal defects and hydrocephalus but ruled out microcephaly. Tests confirmed Zika virus in samples from the umbilical cord and brain tissue, but not the placenta.Other developments------------------In its weekly Zika situation report today, the World Health Organization (WHO) said one more country--El Salvador--has reported a Zika-linked microcephaly case, raising the number reporting such birth defects to 12.The WHO said it still doesn't see an overall decline in the outbreak, though cases have dropped in some countries or parts of countries. So far its risk assessment hasn't changed.In an update today [16 Jun 2016], the CDC reported more local Zika infections in US territories and more travel-related cases in US states. Affected territories reported 135 more illnesses last week, raising the total number of local cases to 1436. One fewer related Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) was reported in the territories, dropping that number to 6. In US states, 64 more travel-related Zika cases were reported, along with the recent lab-acquired case in Pennsylvania, putting the overall total at 756. The number of sexually transmitted Zika cases remained the same, at 11, and 1 more GBS cases was reported in US states, lifting that total to 3.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Blood supplyDate: 14 Jun 2016Source: EurekAlert [edited]<http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-06/nhla-zpt061416.php>Blood safety researchers say it is highly likely that the mosquito-borne Zika virus can be transmitted through blood transfusions and are calling for an evidence-based approach to protecting the blood supply from the threat of Zika virus according to a commentary in the journal Transfusion.The researchers say among several possible steps that could be taken to mitigate safety concerns: deferring blood donors who have symptoms of the infection, developing better blood screening tests, and finding ways to reduce the pathogen.Based on the growing concern over Zika and the blood supply, the National Institutes of Health in February announced interest in supporting research that examines the risk of Zika transmission through transfusion and the potential clinical impact of Zika that might be passed along through blood. In addition the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has made Zika research part of the existing Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III (REDS-III) blood safety research program.Zika virus, once mainly seen in parts of Asia and Africa, has spread through the Americas and is now transmitted by mosquitoes in Puerto Rico. Mosquito-related transmission has not been reported yet in the continental United States, but people who have travelled to areas where active transmission by mosquitoes occurred have developed the infection upon their return to the U.S. The virus has been linked to birth defects and neurological disease, with thousands of cases being reported in Brazil.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Since Zika virus infected individuals have viremias adequate to infect mosquitoes, it seems reasonable to assume that viremic blood can transmit the virus from blood donor to recipient. It is not known if individuals with asymptomatic infections are viremic. - Mod.TY]******[5] Sexual transmissionDate: 9 Jun 2016Source: Euro Surveill.
