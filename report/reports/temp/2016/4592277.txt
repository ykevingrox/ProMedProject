UNICEF [edited]<http://Reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/drc-factsheet-cholera-outbreak-october-2016>Between January and October 2016, a total of 22 002 cases of cholera with 646 deaths were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Compared to the same period in 2015, 12 269 cases of cholera with 192 deaths were reported.8838 cases and 476 cholera-related deaths (fatality rate 2%) were reported in the 8 epidemical provinces of the Congo river basin (Nord Ubangui, Sud Ubangui, Ìäquateur, Tshopo, Mongala, Maniema, Mai-Ndombe et Kinshasa) where 660 000 people are currently at risk of cholera, including 316 800 children aged 0-14 years old.In the Central African Republic, the transmission of the epidemic, declared on 10 Aug 2016, has slowed down. 13 cases were confirmed to have originated in the DRC.A cholera alert has been ongoing since 11 Sep 2016 by the sanitation authority of the Republic of Congo: 16 cases of cholera and 3 deaths were found on Mbamou Island, Brazzaville.The response coming from the Congo River is hindered by limited access, the absence of a surveillance system and appropriate security, a lack of community resilience, and limited local knowledge on subjects of prevention and intervention.The epidemic is already present in Kinshasa, the densely populated capital of the DRC, situated along the Congo River. With its sanitary installations, rudimentary water supply, and arrival of cases onboard boats, the epidemic could rapidly propagate itself and put millions in danger.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at: for the DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>for the Central African Republic: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/66>and for the Republic of Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/166> - Mod.MPP]******[2] Cholera - Uganda (Amuru District)Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016Source: The Monitor [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201610280002.html>At least 2 people have died of cholera in Amuru District, with cases registered rising to 40 patients since the outbreak of the epidemic in September 2016, according to statistics from the district health officials. The in-charge of Bibia Health Centre III in Atiak Sub-county, Ms Susan Aromorach, said the latest case registered was on 22 Oct 2016, when 4 people were admitted to the facility.Ms Aromorach said that among the 4 patients who had been admitted, 2 were children, and they have since been discharged, while one person is still admitted in the isolation ward.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The HealthMap/ProMED map of Uganda can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Cholera - Niger (Dosso Region)Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016Source: Life and Style [machine trans. edited]<https://vidayestilo.terra.com.co/salud/nueve-muertos-y-14-hospitalizados-por-colera-en-el-sur-de-niger,4e2076782b6548149e7e5d1f9d56dfeepgbpixfx.html>At least 9 people died in the last 2 weeks, and another 14 were treated in hospitals because of the cholera epidemic in a rural area in the Dosso region in southern Niger, the Nigerian Minister of Health, Idi Mainasara, reported today, 27 Oct 2016.""In total, 23 people were affected in the region (rural Bella); 6 of them died. The remaining 17 patients were admitted to hospitals, and 3 of them later died,"" said Mainasara to government radio.The 1st case was identified on 13 Oct 2016, when a 16-year-old was admitted to hospital after suffering disease symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. The young man died the day after admission. ""On 16 Oct 2016, 4 other villagers in the area died after suffering the same clinical signs of the disease,"" said Mainasara.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The HealthMap/ProMED map of Niger can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58>. - Mod.MPP]*****[4] Cholera - YemenDate: Fri 28 Oct 2016Source: Xin Hua [edited]<http://china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2016-10/28/content_39584601.htm>The WHO has reported 51 confirmed cases of cholera from 9 governorates in Yemen, with more than 1180 suspected cases, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters here on Thu 27 Oct 2016.The Yemeni Ministry of Public Health has reported 6 laboratory confirmed deaths related to cholera in Sana'a, Aden and Ibb, Dujarric said at a daily news briefing here. WHO is estimating that 7.6 million people are living in affected and at-risk areas, he said.""There are delays in confirming the suspected cases of cholera since there are only 2 laboratories in the country, one in Sana'a and one in Aden,"" the spokesman said. ""Humanitarian partners continue to provide people with water supplies in the affected areas and improve water infrastructure,"" he added.A cholera outbreak in Yemen has put an even greater strain on the country's already fractured health system. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this week that it is on the ground in the hardest hit areas chlorinating water sources, distributing hygiene kits and teaching families about prevention.A cholera outbreak across Yemen is the last thing the conflict-ridden country needed, but it was also expected, given the collapse of the health system. More than 600 health facilities are not functioning, and many of those that are functioning are either poorly staffed or are running on minimum operating capacity.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The HealthMap/ProMED map of Yemen can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>. - Mod.MPP]******[5] Cholera - Philippines (Negros Occidental Province)Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016Source: The Visayan Daily Star [edited]<http://www.visayandailystar.com/2016/October/27/topstory4.htm>The Bacolod City Health Office has declared a cholera outbreak in Handumanan Elementary School 1 in Bacolod City after 10 out of the more than 100 students affected by food and waterborne disease tested positive for cholera.Dr. Grace Tan, CHO Environmental Sanitation Division head, said they are taking steps to prevent the disease from spreading. As of yesterday [26 Oct 2016], however, no additional cases of cholera were noted in HES 1. Out of the 10 affected by cholera, one was an adult, she said.Tan said that all the 129 students affected by the food and waterborne disease in HES 1 have already been discharged from the different hospitals where they had been confined between 14 and 17 Oct 2016.They are consolidating the records since there were children affected by food and waterborne disease who had not been accounted for, since they were only treated at home and did not pass through the health centers. They could all be accounted for when they return to school in November 2016, she said.[Byline: Chrysee Samillano]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The HealthMap/ProMED map of the Philippines can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158>. - Mod.MPP][The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
