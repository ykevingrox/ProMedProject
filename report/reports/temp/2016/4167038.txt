With vaccines to prevent Ebola virus disease (EVD) in people becoming available for the 1st time, the wildlife conservation community faces the obvious question regarding whether there is also a prospect for protecting great apes from this scourge. It is incumbent upon wildlife health professionals to be sure of the safety and actual efficacy of any vaccine we might ultimately want to deploy to try to protect endangered wildlife. If something goes wrong (including if the wild animal subjects in question subsequently and coincidentally die for totally unrelated reasons post-vaccination), the impacts on government's willingness to allow conservationists to manage wildlife when needed can be long lasting. As for much of what we do as wildlife conservationists, sound cost-benefit analysis needs to be part of any proposed vaccination strategies.There is clearly much work to be done to gain a better understanding of Ebola's mysterious life cycle, information that is required to inform any potential intervention strategies conservationists might wish to attempt at a large scale. We cannot skip steps or completely disregard important knowledge gaps when developing potential interventions we hope will be sustainable. That is not to say we want the perfect to be the enemy of the good. We cannot necessarily have every puzzle piece in place before developing a plan. But we owe it to our closest living relatives to abide by basic precautionary standards, to use sound scientific principles, and to utilize genuine peer review before putting any captive or wild great apes (or any non-target species) at risk.

The risks of vaccinating apes from a conservation point of view have been offered by the authors of this comment. Even if the vaccine is safe for great apes, making wild populations dependent on periodic vaccinations is not desirable. From the public health point of view, vaccinating great apes to reduce their role as an amplifying host (which is so far unknown) would be extremely costly and impracticable, because a large proportion of the population would need to be vaccinated. Besides, vaccinating the apes would prevent them from acting as sentinels of the disease. - Mod.PMBThe longer we wait to be sure vaccinating great apes works safely, the closer they will move towards extinction -- which is not the case with human disease. Perhaps the precautionary principle should not rule in this case. - Mod.JW][See Also:Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.3908196].................................................sb/pmb/je/sh"
