Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/bangladesh-125-anthrax-cases-reported-in-sirajganj-74475/>In a follow-up on the human anthrax outbreak in northern Bangladesh, the Sirajganj Health District puts the total human anthrax case count at 125 through [30 May 2016] from Ullapara, Shahzadpur, and Kamarkhand upazilas (counties) and experts say Sirajganj is the most vulnerable to anthrax infection because the germ of the disease has been there since a long time.""The bacteria normally rest in the soil, and can survive for 60 to 100 years in that state. It might have been brought to the district through any diseased animal earlier. When the animal died, people buried it in the field. So the germ got mixed with the soil,"" said Gulzar Hossain, deputy director of regional disease research centre in Sirajganj, Bangladesh media reports.Cattle are infected while grazing the grass, and die within 4 to 5 days, he explained. ""The spread of anthrax in the area this year [2016] is due to toxic reaction in the soil caused by strong humidity and slight rain,"" Gulzar said.In addition, the outbreak has been linked to the slaughtering of diseased cows, lack of proper monitoring and allegations of a livestock department not keeping up on vaccinations.Anthrax is a pathogen in livestock and wild animals. Some of the more common herbivores are cattle, sheep, goats, horses, camels, and deer. It infects humans primarily through occupational or incidental exposure with infected animals of their skins [that is, infected animal blood on a human arm with cuts. - Mod.MHJ][Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[""Toxic reaction in the soil"" ... don't know what that is. With the right black alkaline soils one can get limited germination and cycling. How important this is to the ecology of this disease is unclear as the organism soon runs out of nutrients and sporulates. Rain will also float spores to the soil surface. Unfortunately Sirajganj has clay soils which are normally inimical for extended spore survival. I suspect that a few more animals have died and were butchered with bad results for the humans who came into contact with the contaminated blood and meat. And publicity revealed more human cases. Until livestock vaccination is implemented this will continue.Maps of Bangladesh can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/bw2fuve> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13276>. - Mod.MHJ]
