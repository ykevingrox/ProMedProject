For comparison, they also sequenced resistant samples from Australia and Ireland.The study, results of which were published in the journal PLoS Medicine in August 2016, showed that all of the resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade found in South Asia and that most of the positive results reported outside of Asia could be linked to recent travel to India.""We were running a project on some shigella isolates from Bhutan that were fluoroquinolone-resistant,"" corresponding author Stephen Baker, a microbiologist based at the hospital, one of Oxford University's clinical research units, told SciDev.Net. Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is commonly prescribed to treat shigellosis. ""We started working on some resistant strains from Viet Nam also and found they were much more closely related than we thought they would be,"" said Baker.Baker and colleagues sequenced 12 resistant samples from Bhutan, 11 samples from Viet Nam, and a sample each from Thailand and Cambodia. They also worked with partners to sequence 19 samples in Australia and 16 in Ireland. ""Once we had found the relationship between the Bhutanese isolates and the Vietnamese [samples], I contacted some of my collaborators and asked what strains/data they had; they all had a common ancestor,"" Baker said.Of the 45 samples obtained from outside South Asia, 27 were from people who had travelled to the region, and 80 per cent had visited India. Baker said the resistant _S. sonnei_ strain is most likely ""very common in India, but infrequently reported.""Based on the data, Baker and his colleagues were able to pinpoint South Asia as the primary source of antibiotic-resistant _S. sonnei_ that is spreading throughout Asia, Australia, the US, and Europe. ""The genetics show these organisms have arisen and are spreading from South Asia,"" he said. Baker attributed the outbreak to increased prosperity in South Asia and the overuse of fluoroquinolones, creating ""huge selective pressure"" on _S. sonnei_.Jason Andrews, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stanford Medicine, University of California, said that the results of the study were both ""compelling and alarming"" and ""underscore the urgent need to address drug-resistant pathogens through vaccination or other measures.""In particular, Andrews noted, the antimicrobial resistance problem in Asia has quickly become a global problem, ""requiring a global response in terms of resources and strategies for containing resistant enteric bacteria.""[byline: Sanjit Das][1.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the _Shigellae_, particularly as a specific multidrug-resistant (MDR) lineage of _Shigella sonnei_ (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for _Shigella_ infections. However, ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ are being increasingly isolated in Asia and sporadically reported on other continents. We hypothesized that Asia is a primary hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_.""Methods and Findings. We performed whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 60 contemporaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ isolated in four countries within Asia (Viet Nam, n = 11; Bhutan, n = 12; Thailand, n = 1; Cambodia, n = 1) and 2 outside of Asia (Australia, n = 19; Ireland, n = 16). We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny, we found that all ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of lineage III. Furthermore, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within _S. sonnei_ may be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the United States and Europe. Our analysis was limited by the number of _S. sonnei_ sequences available from diverse geographical areas and time periods, and we cannot discount the potential existence of other unsampled reservoir populations of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_.""Conclusions. This study suggests that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is likely driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, with _S. sonnei_ acting as a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial-resistant Gram negative bacteria spread globally.""Shigella causes about 500 000 cases of diarrhea in the United States annually (<https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/resources.html>). Of the 4 species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States, as well as becoming the predominant species worldwide according the authors of the journal article. Humans are the only reservoir for shigella, which is easily transmitted person-to-person, because shigella are relatively resistant to gastric acidity and only a few organisms if swallowed are sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract. The organism is spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that has come into contact with stool of a person infected with shigella.Since shigellosis usually resolves in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antimicrobial treatment is used for more severe disease. Antibiotics have also been often used to lessen transmission by limiting the duration of fecal shedding that may otherwise last up to several weeks. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options. Resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is common, and resistance to ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, as well as 3rd-generation cephalosporins, is increasing in the US and worldwide (<http://www.cdc.gov/narms/pdf/2012-annual-report-narms-508c.pdf>). Outbreaks of infections caused by multidrug-resistant shigella, including isolates resistant to azithromycin or ciprofloxacin -- the 2 antibiotics most commonly used to treat shigellosis -- have been reported in Australia, Europe, and North America among men who have sex with men (MSM).
