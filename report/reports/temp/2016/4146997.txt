Wisconsin Department of Health Services [edited]<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/elizabethkingia.htm>The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), Division of Public Health (DPH) is currently investigating an outbreak of bloodstream infections caused by _Elizabethkingia_. The majority of patients acquiring this infection are over the age of 65, and all patients have a history of at least one underlying serious illness.At this time, the source of these infections is unknown and the Department is working diligently to contain this outbreak.As part of the outbreak investigation activities, DPH and the CDC are conducting site visits and collecting environmental samples from both private residences and health care facilities. CDC is also assisting Wisconsin with testing of samples from a variety of potential sources, including health care products, water sources, and the environment. To date, none of these have been found to be a source of the bacteria.The Department has alerted health care providers, infection preventionists and laboratories statewide and provided information as well as treatment guidance for this outbreak. After that initial guidance was sent, there has been a rapid identification of cases and healthcare providers have been able to treat and improve outcomes for patients.Wisconsin 2016 _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ outbreak:Case counts between 1 Nov 2015 and 6 Apr 2016---------------------------------------------Confirmed = 57Under investigation= 1Possible cases = 4Total cases reported to Wisconsin DPH = 62Affected counties include Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Washington, Waukesha, and Winnebago.There have been 17 deaths among individuals with confirmed _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ infections, and an additional 1 death among possible cases for a total of 18 deaths. It has not been determined if these deaths were caused by the infection or other serious pre-existing health problems.This investigation is ongoing. Case counts may change as additional illnesses are identified and more cases are laboratory confirmed. Possible cases tested positive for _Elizabethkingia_, but will never be confirmed as the same strain of _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ because the outbreak specimens are no longer available to test.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[No more cases have been added to this list in Wisconsin but an additional case was microbiologically confirmed. No new cases have been reported in Michigan, which has one confirmed case, or in any other states.Winnebago county is still the newest and the northernmost county to be affected. It is due north of Fond du Lac county and can be seen on a map of the state's counties at <http://wisconsindot.gov/PublishingImages/travel/road/hwy-maps/counties.gif>. With Winnebago and Sheboygan counties being the newest on the list, it may be the case that the cluster is moving northward but without a time line of cases and their locations, the spread cannot be represented.As a reminder regarding antimicrobial sensitivities of the outbreak strain (from Wisconsin Department of Health Services, For Health Professionals <https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/elizabethkingia.htm>): Although _Elizabethkingia_ are multidrug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) conducted at Wisconsin clinical microbiology laboratories of recent isolates of _Elizabethkingia_ demonstrated most of the isolates tested are susceptible to fluoroquinolones, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. AST (MIC [minimum inhibitory concentration] testing) and characterization of strains has been conducted at CDC on 9 isolates of _Elizabethkingia_ from blood specimens collected from Wisconsin residents. These isolates include 5 _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ with PFGE [pulse field gel electrophoresis] outbreak pattern 1, 3 isolates of _E. anophelis_ with non-outbreak PFGE patterns and 1 isolate of _Elizabethkingia_ species. These MIC results demonstrate susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, minocycline, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The medical literature suggests combination treatment with these agents may be more effective than monotherapy. Whenever possible, treatment should be guided by AST.The organism was first characterized in a 2011 report (1), isolated from the midgut of _Anopheles gambiae_. A PubMed search found several reports of human infection, an 8 day old girl with meningitis from the Central African Republic (2), 2 neonates with meningitis in Hong Kong of whom one of the mothers had chorioamnionitis with the organism (3), and an intensive care unit cluster of 5 cases from Singapore (4). Since it can be easily confused with _E. meningoseptica_ (an organism previously referred to as _Flavobacterium meningosepticum_ and then _Chryseobacterium meningosepticum_), other cases may well have occurred. All of these cases were nosocomial in origin unlike, apparently, the Wisconsin/Michigan cases.References----------1.
