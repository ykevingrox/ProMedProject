The Times of India (TOI), State health department, Pune office report [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Monkey-fever-spreads-to-17-more-villages/articleshow/51949590.cms>The tickborne Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever, is spreading with every passing day. The outbreak, initially confined to a village in Sindhudurg district, has now spread to 18 villages. The virus is highly pathogenic and can only be tested in laboratories with high biosafety standards. Since the last week of January [2016], it has claimed 3 lives and infected 94 people in the state [Maharashtra]. Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed the presence of the virus in the blood samples of these patients.""There is no denying the fact that the virus has spread to a total 18 villages in a short span. But all these villages are in Dodamarg taluka. In view of the rapid virus transmission, we have started treating every fever case as a suspected KFD case and administering treatment accordingly,"" Yogesh Sale, Sindhudurg district health officer, said.The first cases of the viral disease emerged in Ker village in the last week of January [2016] and spread to Zolambe, Talkat, Kolzar, Kudase, Tamboli, Asaniye, Ghodgewadi, Kendre, Morle, Palaye, Konalkatta, Usap, Degave, Virdi, Padave Majgaon, Talekhol and Dodmarge in two-and-a-half months. Sale said, ""It is the second spike of fever that takes a toll on those with low immunity or those who have underlying medical conditions like diabetes or hypertension. The 3 patients who succumbed to the virus suffered from heart disease, dengue infection and alcoholism.""The monkey fever outbreak has kept the state health machinery on its toes right from the beginning. To arrest the spread, health officials have initiated tick and fever surveillance in the region. But the virus has been advancing to newer areas.The viral infection starts with high fever and body ache and produces a haemorrhage similar to the one in dengue patients. It has a mortality rate of 5 to 10 per cent. ""The confirmed patients are being given supportive and symptomatic treatment at the primary health centre at Talkat. Their condition is not at all critical. They are recovering well. The symptoms of monkey fever are akin to dengue and other viral infections,"" Sale said.The Sindhudurg zilla parishad has procured oil repellent dimethyl phthalate to curb new cases. ""We have distributed the oil bottles mainly to cashew farmers and those who are exposed to forest areas. They have been told to apply the oil all over the body before venturing into the forest or farms,"" Sale said.""We have intensified surveillance in and around the affected villages and given directives to our health staff to examine every patient having fever,"" state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.Villages have been affected as follows: Asaniye 11 cases, Zolambe 14, Ker 26, Degave 10,Virdi 7, Kolzar 5, and Talkat 4.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The report does not mention whether prophylactic vaccination is being instituted in and around the affected regions. - Mod.UBAMaps of India can be seen at<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37917>. - Copy.Ed.AO]
