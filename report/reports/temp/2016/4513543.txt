The West Australian [edited]<https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/32713148/rare-strain-of-bacteria-on-the-rise/#page1>3/4ths of the cases of meningococcal disease in WA [Western Australia] so far this year [2016] have been caused by rare W strains [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W] that very few people are vaccinated against. Figures obtained by The Weekend West show 9 of the 12 cases of the disease this year have been linked to strains from the bacteria group W. Type B [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B] caused the other 3.Meningococcal disease is a rare, life-threatening illness caused by a bacterial infection of the blood or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain.A young WA child -- the 12th case this year [2016] -- died from the disease last week. In the past, there have been virtually no local cases caused by W strains, but there were 2 in 2014, 4 cases last year [2015] and 9 this year. The WA Health Department said this week it was monitoring the trend, which was also being seen in states including Victoria and could have implications for vaccination recommendations.Victorian authorities have seen a sharp rise in a group W strain known as ST11, which was responsible for 4 per cent of meningococcal cases in 2013 but 30 percent of cases last year [2015].At present, a vaccine to protect against type C meningococcal disease, historically the most common in Australia, is free for children and given at 12 months [of age]. A vaccine against meningococcal B, the most common type in WA [the 1st paragraph above says that this year [2016] serogroup W, not serogroup B, is the most common serogroup], is available but not government-funded. There is a privately funded vaccine against W strains, but it is usually only advised for overseas travellers.The Health Department spokesman said that while the overall number of invasive meningococcal disease cases in WA had been falling since 2000, there had been a recent increase in cases linked to W strains.The Telethon Kids Institute is doing a trial of a vaccine against the A, C, W and Y strains in young children.[Byline: Cathy O'Leary]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common.There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.Following the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.Similarly, serotype replacement has been observed following pneumococcal vaccination programs, which necessitated expansion of serotypes covered by the vaccine (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-vaccine strain emergence - USA (AK) 20070425.1348).Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W ST-11 as a cause of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx>).Western Australia, covering the entire western 1/3rd of Australia, is mostly arid, its population being concentrated in the fertile southwest corner and its capital, Perth (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.]
