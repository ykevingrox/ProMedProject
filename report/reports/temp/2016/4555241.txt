The News (Pakistan) [edited]<https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/156405-Rabies-kills-50-year-old-Mauripur-resident>A man has died from rabies at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) [Karachi], taking the toll from the infected animalborne disease to 14 at this public hospital alone this year [2016], said JPMC joint executive director Dr Seemin Jamali on [Mon 10 Oct 2016].Rabies is a viral disease that can be prevented if the person bitten by a diseased dog or any other animal is vaccinated timely, but once the disease grips a person, he or she [nearly always] dies painfully and there is no cure for full-blown rabies in the world.OB, a 50 year old resident of Mauripur [neighborhood of Karachi], had been brought to the JPMC on [Sat 8 Oct 2016] with full-blown rabies and died on [Sun 9 Oct 2016] as no cure was available to save the life of a person with full-blown rabies, Dr Jamali said. She said it was the 14th death of full-blown rabies seen at the hospital. She cautioned that rabies is a highly lethal disease in which the mortality rate [is practically] 100 per cent if timely action is not taken. Dr Jamali said timely vaccination and immunoglobulin administration is the only way to save a person bitten by an infected animal, especially by a dog. ""This unfortunate person, had been bitten multiple times by the dog and he supposedly took vaccination from some hospital in the city, but despite that he developed rabies, which took his life,"" she said.Only 3 hospitals -- JPMC, Civil Hospital Karachi [CHK] and Indus Hospital -- are said to be offering rabies vaccination in the city at the moment. Around 5000 persons, mostly children and women, have been brought to the JPMC alone this year [2016] with wounds inflicted by stray dogs in attacks in Karachi, while no data of persons with dog-bites are available at the CHK, Indus or any other hospital of the metropolis.""Rabies should be declared a notifiable disease as we don't have any data of persons having rabies in the province or even in Karachi. We don't know how many persons are bitten by dogs in Karachi, how many of them are vaccinated and how many develop rabies,"" Dr Jamali said, observing that in the absence of accurate data, no plans could be made to control the menace. Dr Jamali said that if a person is bitten by a dog or any other animal, the wound must be washed immediately with tap water and the victim should be taken to any hospital where the rabies vaccination was available. ""Washing the wound with plain, tap water flushes out most of the viruses and then the affected person should be taken to hospital. In Karachi, the anti-rabies vaccination is available at the JPMC, the Civil Hospital Karachi and the Indus Hospital.""In case of a dog-bite, a person is given 5 injections of the anti-rabies vaccine in the muscles (intramuscular), and an injection of immunoglobulin (antibodies) separately over a period of several weeks, she said, adding that now the majority of people did not develop the dreaded disease if the patient was timely and properly vaccinated.In 2015, around 6590 persons were vaccinated against rabies, including women and children, and the majority of the victims were children, who could not defend themselves against dogs. ""On a daily basis, 70 to 80 persons are brought to the JPMC for vaccination and treatment, which shows the severity of the situation. We have a sizeable number of stray dogs on our streets and they are freely attacking people.""According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, dog vaccination is the most reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective way to prevent people from rabies. Although dogs are the primary source of rabies, the disease can affect other animals too and it is wise to vaccinate all your animals against rabies, particularly livestock. Experts say rabies is currently responsible for an estimated 59 000 human deaths a year, almost all transmitted via dog-bites. Up to 60 per cent of deaths from rabies are of children under the age of 15. Very few victims have access to the palliative care that would alleviate the suffering of their final days. Despite its almost 100 per cent case fatality rate, canine rabies is completely preventable with modern vaccines, experts believe.[byline: M Waqar Bhatti]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the report above, the victim, ""bitten several times by a dog"", developed rabies although ""supposedly took vaccination from some hospital in the city"".

The rabid dog died few days later and its head was found positive for rabies when it was brought to the municipal agriculture office for laboratory tests.[see comment]. ""We were alarmed because rabies is a deadly disease and our health office should exert all efforts to control it,"" Pinzon said.It was learned that the 4 other bitten victims will be brought by the municipal health office at the Animal Bite Center in Bacnotan town [Fri 7 Oct 2016] for vaccination and the 20 other individuals for examination. The 20 people, all neighbors in the village, were suspected of rabies contamination after they and the victims allegedly participated in a drinking party using a lone [single/shared? - Mod.SH] glass of liquor.Pinzon said he would seek assistance from governor Francisco ""Pacoy"" Ortega III to defray the expenses for the expensive rabies vaccines.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Hopefully, the statement that ""the child was tested positive for rabies when brought for examination at the Regional Animal Disease"" becomes erroneous.There is no indication in the report that the bitten 4year old child developed clinical rabies; hopefully this interpretation is correct and the child has undergone/is undergoing the regime of post exposure treatment (vaccination), preventing the development of rabies.So far, the diagnosis of rabies in humans or animals is not feasible prior to their development of clinical disease. Clarification or correction would be appreciated. - Mod.ASMaps of the Philippines can be seen at <http://www.charleskeng.com/images-map/philmap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56097>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] Nepal (Rautahat, Province Two): suspected multiple human exposures, jackal incriminatedDate: Wed 5 Oct 2016Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/nepal-jackal-attacks-dozens-in-rautahat-district-hospital-runs-out-of-rabies-vaccines-16669/>During the past 2 days in some villages in the southern Nepalese district of Rautahat [Province Two], something very frightening happened as people went out for walks or to go to the toilet: they were attacked by a rabid jackal. According to local media, some 36 people were victims of the rabid jackal's biting spree, receiving serious injuries on all areas of their bodies, including 18 bite injuries above the neck. Half of the injured are said to be in serious condition.The wild, sickened animal attacked people in Garuda, Mohammedpur, Pipparapacharukhi, and Gamhariya villages between 3 and 4 Oct 2016. As patients poured into the local hospital, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) aka rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin supplies ran out and a good number of patients had to be referred to other hospitals for treatment.There is no word on the status of the animal, whether it has been captured or killed, based on reports.--communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[According to the news of the Himalayan Times [dated 4 Oct 2016] a wild jackal attacked one child, 12 women, and 13 men. Since the hospital did not have enough rabies vaccine for 28 people, 15 of them who were bitten above their neck region have been referred to the Sukraraj Tropical Hospital in Kathmandu for treatment. (<http://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/strayed-into-human-settlements-jackal-bites-28-rautahat/>)Rabies is endemic in Nepal. The commonest lyssavirus present is genotype 1 (rabies virus, RABV), with human infections being mostly due to the canine biotype. The main vector for rabies in Nepal is the domestic dog. Rabies in wildlife is most likely present in Nepal. However, wildlife rabies surveillance is not in place and no data is available for the years 2011 to 2013 (<http://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/Rabies_CP_Nepal_09_2014.pdf>).Mongoose (_Herpestes_ spp), jackals (_Canis aureus_), foxes (_Vulpes bengalensis_), and wolves (_Canis lupus_) have been incriminated as wildlife reservoirs of rabies in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Among them jackals are distributed in Nepal, India, Sri-Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, south west Asia, and south eastern Europe.Maps of Nepal can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal#Subdivisions> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32849>. - Mod.TTM******[4] China (Fengxian District, Shanghai): canine, human exposureDate: Sat 8 Oct 2916Source: Shanghai Daily [edited]<http://www.shanghaidaily.com/metro/public-services/Suspected-rabid-dog-killed-after-biting-22-people/shdaily.shtml>A black dog running wild in Shanghai's Fengxian District bit more than 20 people before it was caught and killed. Guhua Hospital in Fengxian said it had treated a total of 22 victims of the dog's attacks -- 10 of them between 9 am and 10 am yesterday [7 Oct 2016].Most of the patients had their legs bitten and they all said they had been attacked by a black dog with a neck strap near Renmin Road, Qixiang Road, and Jianghai Road in Fengxian. The hospital called on any other injured victims to receive vaccinations as soon as possible and said the dog was highly likely to have been affected with rabies.The incident triggered an emergency plan and the hospital called back all medical staff on National Day holiday to treat patients' wounds and inject rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin immediately. Initially some patients only received rabies vaccine, which takes effect in about one week, but the hospital called them to have immunoglobulin injected too as that takes effect quickly. By 4:30 pm, 9 men and 13 women had been treated.The hospital also reported the attacks to the district disease control center and police, who found and then killed the dog to prevent further attacks. The hospital reminded people that rabies can cause death and people bitten by dogs should receive rabies vaccine or immunoglobulin as soon as possible.In Shanghai, dogs should have been vaccinated before being kept as pets and owners also have to register their dogs with public security authorities.Last month [September 2016], more than 20 people were bitten by a white dog in Chaoyang District of Beijing. It is not known whether that dog was caught.[byline: Yang Meiping]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22205>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[5] Viet Nam: humanDate: Sat 1 Oct 2016 08:33 pm (GMT+7)Source: VN Express International [edited]<http://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/49-vietnamese-killed-by-rabies-in-nine-months-3477277.html>Viet Nam reported 49 human rabies deaths in the 1st 9 months [of 2016], asking the public to pay more attention to the prevention and treatment of dog bites. The health ministry said the deaths were recorded in 20 cities and provinces. Last year [2015] there were 67 rabies deaths in total.People bitten by dogs or cats are recommended to seek medical attention immediately. Doctors will decide if vaccination is needed. The rabies virus is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals. The incubation period on humans is typically 1 to 3 months. Untreated rabies causes acute encephalitis and is almost always fatal.Viet Nam used to have hundreds of human rabies deaths a year. Millions of dollars are also spent each year on vaccination. The country has been making efforts to reduce dog bite incidents and fatalities in recent years. By increasing the number of vaccinated dogs, it aims to eliminate rabies by 2020. According to the General Statistics Office, there are around 10 million dogs in the country.Rabies kills about 55 000 people a year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, which said children under 15 are the commonest victims.[byline: Phuong Trang]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Viet Nam can be seen at <http://www.onlineasiatravel.com/images/vn/vietnam-map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/152>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******Africa------[6] South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal): canineDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016 08:58Source: News 24 (S. Africa) [edited]<http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sickly-pup-had-rabies-20160929>A case of rabies has been confirmed by Chase Valley [KwaZulu-Natal, KZN] Vet after a sickly pup from Sweetwaters was brought in on Monday [26 Sep 2016].The pup, a stray, was picked up 3 weeks ago by [person] on the Sweetwaters Road and taken to his home. On [Sun 9 Oct 2016], the person posted a plea for help on the Pietermaritzburg Businesses Facebook page, that the stray, which he had named Simba, was ill. ""I just met little Simba about 3 weeks ago. He stays with my mom. Simba woke up on [Sat 8 Oct 2016] shaking, jaws locked, not breathing well (choking), sensitive on front paws, sick. It's scary,"" he wrote.""We tried to send him to a vet on [Sat 24 Sep 2016], but we could not afford the fees, but the ladies there were so helpful; they suggested a recovery meal and advised us to give him lots of water, keep him warm, and hope for the best. I am afraid we might be losing the battle, but he's been holding strong,"" said the post. ""May anyone who can please help. We would love to see little Simba grow, that is if we are not too late.""Chase Valley Vet's Dr Estee van Aardt said Simba was brought into their offices on [Mon 26 Sep 2016] and was thought to be about 3 months old. ""The dog was quite flat, and couldn't swallow,"" said Van Aardt. ""The owner said it looked like it was choking and had been that way for 2 to 3 days, and was getting worse."" She said the dog was euthanised because of its state, and samples were sent to the Onderstepoort rabies laboratory in Pretoria for testing. The results came back positive.uMgungundlovu [KZN] State Vet Dr Allen Still said that the virus may have either been transmitted to the dog by a wild animal such as a jackal, but may have also originated from a dog brought in from another area. He said the area had not had a rabid dog incident in a ""long time"", and that residents who had not vaccinated their pets should do so as a precaution.He said the State Clinic, at 458 Townbush Road, was open for vaccinations between 2 pm and 4 pm on Fridays, and that the clinic often travelled to rural areas to vaccinate dogs. ""When people think of a rabid dog, they get an image of a mad, barking dog, frothing at the mouth, but this is not always the case. Sometimes the dog just appears very weak and is semi-paralysed, and recognising it can be difficult.""A source who could not be named said the virus moved quite slowly in a community but can move long distances when people move infected dogs. ""Most of all human rabies is from dog bites and so wherever people keep dogs the disease is a threat,"" said the source. ""Rabies is most common in dogs and we have a small wildlife cycle at present focused in Underberg, originating from the Midlands [KZN]. Dog rabies is more of a threat to humans due to the close contact, however, all rabies is life threatening and must be taken seriously. Current dog hot spots are in Ugu and the communal areas from Illembe north ward [KZN].""Rabies in KZN has decreased from 476 cases per year 7 years ago to just 37 cases a year. Cases of rabies in humans has also decreased in the last 7 years from 27 cases a year to 2 in the past 3 years.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The scenario described in the report above, addressing a pup collected on the street, brought home, devotedly attended by children and later discovered to be rabid, may be viewed as ""classical"". Since juvenile animals, in many cases, do not present the expected signs of aggressive rabies but milder signs, as adequately described above (""appears very weak and is semi-paralysed""), This leads to rabies not being suspected so such kids may fail to seek immediate medical advise and do not undergo the timely needed post-exposure treatment regime with -- too often -- possible tragic consequences. This scenario deserves to be always remembered by the public and by the involved professionals. - Mod.ASMaps of South Africa can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/south_africa_prov_map2.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/947>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ
