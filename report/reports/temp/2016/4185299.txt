Focus Taiwan [edited]<http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201604250019.aspx>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced a confirmed case of rodentborne hantavirus hemorrhagic fever [with renal syndrome; HFRS] on Monday [25 Apr 2016], the 3rd case of its kind in Taiwan this year [2016]. The patient is a 57 year old fish vendor living in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, the CDC stated.The statement said that the man sought medical treatment at a local clinic on 1 Apr [2016] after developing a fever. Then 2 days later, he was admitted to a hospital where he received further treatment for his persistent fever and other symptoms, including dizziness and muscle aches. The hospital later diagnosed him as having been infected with [a] hantavirus, the CDC said.As of press time, no one else in the patient's family had developed symptoms suggesting [a] hantavirus infection. Meanwhile, city health authorities captured 7 brown rats and one house shrew around the places where the patient lives and works, with 2 of the rats testing positive for [a] hantavirus, the CDC noted. ""To reduce the risk of further transmission, the local health authority has implemented a number of rodent control measures within a 200 meter radius of the victim's residence and neighborhood,"" the statement said.According to CDC statistics, there have been 3 cases of hantavirus infection confirmed in the country since the beginning of the year [2016]. All 3 patients reside in Kaohsiung, with 2 of them coming from a family cluster. Although the latest case resides in a different village from the 1st 2, their residences are only 400 meters apart, the CDC said. Since 2001, a total of 19 cases of hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have been confirmed in Taiwan, CDC statistics show.Based on the results of a study in 2011 on the most common and widespread rodent-borne diseases in Taiwan's 5 metropolitan areas, people who live or work near traditional markets and night markets are at increased risk of contracting [a] hantavirus [infection], the CDC said.Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever is caused by hantaviruses, with rodents serving as the natural reservoir for the virus. It is transmitted from infected rodents to humans by inhalation of aerosolized particles from rodent excreta or a bite from an infected rodent. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, lower back pain, nausea, vomiting, varying degrees of hemorrhagic manifestations and kidney involvement. The virus does not spread between humans.[byline: Chen Wei-ting and Elizabeth Hsu]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The specific hantavirus involved in these 3 cases is not stated. In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are: Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of HFRS frequently in China. Since brown rats were found positive, Seoul virus appears to be the most likely virus responsible for these cases.Hantaan virus has several (up to 5 have been reported) subtypes and is transmitted by the field mouse _Apodemus agrarius_, whereas Seoul virus is less variable and is transmitted by the rat _Rattus norvegicus_. A 3rd hantavirus that causes HFRS, Muju virus, has been reported from the Korean peninsula. It has been reported that during 1990-1997, there were recorded in China nearly 400 000 cases of HFRS, of which 1.6 per cent were fatal.An image of _Rattus norvegicus_ can be accessed at <http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Taiwan can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>. - Mod.TY]
