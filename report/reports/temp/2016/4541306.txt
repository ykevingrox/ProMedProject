Lusaka Times [edited]<https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/10/05/govt-tackling-chama-anthrax-outbreak/>[The] Government has assured the nation that there is no need to panic over the anthrax disease that has broken out in Chama district in Muchinga Province. Anthrax broke out last month on 22 Sep [2016] in Chama with 44 cases [presumably human cases. - Mod.MHJ] having been reported.In a ministerial statement issued in parliament today [5 Oct 2016], Health Minister Chilufya Chitalu said no deaths have been recorded and assured that the disease would be contained. ""People should not panic because government is in control, we will contain the outbreak of anthrax in Chama district,"" he said.Dr. Chitalu said the disease could have been caused by some people who touched, breathed or ate carcasses of hippos from the Luangwa River. He said his ministry has constituted various intervention measures such as distribution of information, communication and educational materials, and active surveillance by authorities. He said a Task force Committee has been put in place and that a mobile laboratory would soon be dispatched to the area.Meanwhile, the Minister has urged people who might have eaten hippopotamus carcasses to report themselves to the nearest clinic or hospital for medical check-ups.Anthrax is a severe illness caused by bacteria called Bacillus anthracis and can result in pneumonia, blood infection, and death.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 6 Oct 2016, 7:48 AM EDTSource: Bloomberg<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-06/hippos-are-no-longer-on-zambian-menus-as-anthrax-threat-rises>Zambians should stop eating hippopotamus meat in areas affected by an anthrax outbreak in the northeast of the southern African nation, Chitalu Chilufya, the Health Minister, said.A regional drought has left little water to wallow in for the mammals that can weigh more than a Toyota Corolla, causing crowding and resulting in deaths. In June [2016], the Department of National Parks and Wildlife called off a cull of as many as 2000 hippos over 5 years in the area after an outcry from charity organizations including the U.K.-based Born Free Foundation.""People in the areas of outbreak of anthrax should at all times desist from handling or eating infected dead hippo meat as this is the source of infection of anthrax in the area,"" Chilufya told lawmakers in Lusaka, the capital, on Wed [4 Oct 2016]. ""The government has sufficient capacity to respond to such outbreaks and the situation is under control.""While no deaths have been reported, 22 cases of anthrax have been recorded since the outbreak started on 22 Sep [2016] in the Chama district, about 700 km (435 mi) north east of Lusaka, he said. So far, only cases of cutaneous, or the skin form of anthrax, have been detected.Every year during Zambia's dry season that lasts from around April to November, river levels drop, forcing herds of hippos into increasingly crowded pools during the heat of the day. A regional drought that's the worst in 35 years has also increased competition over nocturnal grazing, meaning the beasts have to roam further to find food.[Byline: Matthew Hill]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The previous report [Anthrax - Zambia (02): hippopotamus cull suspended 20160616.4291404] contains a map showing the Luangwa River Valley through eastern Zambia and to where it joins the Zambezi river.For additional maps, go to:Zambia:<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/170><http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zambia_rel01.jpg>National Parks:<http://www.zambiatourism.com/map>Lower Zambezi National Park:<http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/nationalparks/lowerzam.htm><https://www.expertafrica.com/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/reference-map>Luangwa River:<https://www.expertafrica.com/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/reference-map><http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luangwa_River>Luangwa:<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luangwa,_Zambia>As hippos are not the friendliest of animals we must presume that the locals were butchering dead hippos. From the presence of cutaneous lesions on 44 people - and such are pathognemonic in anthrax, inflamed, itch, no pain - it seems, in the absence of laboratory confirmation, that ""anthrax"" was assumed. With luck, the expected mobile laboratory and investigative team, when they arrive, can find animal carcasses to sample. As the 44 human cases will have been treated with antibiotics, their wounds are effectively sterile, at least for _B. anthracis_. But keep in mind, the best way to sample human cases is to use a needle & syringe to suck out some bloody fluid from underneath the cutaneous lesion. - Mod.MHJ]
