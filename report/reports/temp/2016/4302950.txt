Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled. Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double√•  vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.AI Rasheed Sardine was shipped to retail stores in California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. AI Rasheed Sardine is in a vacuum package with expiration date 3/2017. No illnesses have been reported to date.The potential for contamination was noted after New York State - Department of Agriculture sampling and analysis.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is unclear what criteria were used for the recall but commonly fish recalls occur if the prepared fish are not eviscerated.Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.Control of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as, control of water activity, or pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.Control of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches [7.6-12.7 cm] in length). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) (4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.These products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
