Young people have been urged to get vaccinated if they are planning on attending further festivals this summer and not to go if they are unwell.Public Health England's [PHE] latest Health Protection Report, volume 10 issue 25, published 5 Aug [2016; <http://bit.ly/2aFUQIV>], states that, since June 2016, a ""significant number of measles cases have been confirmed in teenagers and young adults who attended or worked at music and arts festivals around England."" The report said this followed an increase in measles this year, with 234 cases confirmed between January and June 2016, compared with 54 cases reported for the same period last year [2015]. It states that measles is ""extremely infectious and events like festivals, where people are mixing closely with each other, provide the ideal place for the infection to spread.""PHE highlighted 36 reported measles cases linked to at least 8 music and arts festivals across England this summer [2016]. The majority of the confirmed cases -- 12 -- were from the south west, where the Somerset festival Glastonbury is held. In London 9 cases have been confirmed, with the south east (6), West Midlands (4), East of England (2), and north west (1) all reporting linked cases. Cases have also been identified in Wales (2) and Scotland (1).The current data have been described as ""provisional"", and it is likely that more cases linked to festivals will be identified as investigations continue. The vast majority of cases were unvaccinated (30) or partially vaccinated (3) teenagers and young adults, with an average age of 20 years.The report states: ""PHE is aware of at least 3 cases who attended festivals despite being symptomatic. PHE is reminding teenagers and young people who are unsure about their vaccination status to check with their GP and make an appointment, if needed, to ensure they receive the two doses of MMR vaccine required. All age groups are urged to be aware of the symptoms of measles and not to attend festivals if they are unwell. Young people planning to attend other festivals over the summer are in particular urged to follow this advice.Public Health England is an executive agency of the Department of Health, with the mission ""to protect and improve the nation's health and to address inequalities"".[byline: Joseph Wilkes]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of the UK may be accessed at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/europe/physical-map-of-UK.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Nigeria: weekly updateDate: Fri 29 Jul 2016Source: Weekly Epidemiology Report, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health 6(29) [not yet posted on the Ministry website, edited]2.1.

The most recent 10 cases were reported between 25 and 31 July. Of the 44 samples sent for laboratory testing, 22 samples tested positive for measles.In cooperation with the North Darfur Ministry of Health, the CDO started a vaccination campaign targeting all South Sudanese refugees in the affected areas. The host community is covered by the routine vaccination campaign.Furthermore, the CDO with support from Unicef, the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, and the state Health Ministry, is responding to the needs of the South Sudanese refugees in the locality.An emergency general food distribution was carried out targeting 2719 of the refugees who arrived in late June and early July [2016] in Dalil Babekir, Dalil Dukri, and Jodat villages. Health and nutrition support has also been provided.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Measles is caused by a virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, genus _Morbillivirus_. It is a highly infectious virus that is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the mucous membranes, then spreads throughout the body. It can spread quickly through a non-immune population where people are living in poverty closely together, as in a refugee camp.Maps of Sudan may be accessed at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Sudan> and < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54722>.South Sudan broke away from Sudan in July 2011 and established its own independent state after decades of war between the 2 former northern and southern regions of one country. North Darfur State is in Sudan's western Darfur region. To the north east, North Darfur, Darfur's largest state, borders Libya and Chad.According to the Sudan Tribune on 5 Aug 2016 (<http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article59837>), thousands of South Sudanese refugees in North Darfur state have launched an appeal to the Sudanese government and aid groups to provide them with food, clothing, and shelter.Last month [July 2016] Sudan said it has received 500 000 South Sudanese refugees since 2013. South Sudanese tribal chief Ajack Deng Kual told Sudan Tribune that 7000 refugees have arrived in the locality of Ailliet, 325 km [202 mi] south east of North Darfur capital, El-Fasher, from Bahr el-Ghazal region in South Sudan.He pointed that there are no official statistics on the exact number of refugees who arrived in North Darfur, saying they are in dire need for food, shelter, drugs and clothing.A refugee from Awil town, pointed to the miserable situation in South Sudan, saying the vast majority of refugees in North Darfur are women, children, and the elderly [particularly vulnerable individuals, making this an extremely serious situation. - Mod.LK]
