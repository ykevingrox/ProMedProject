Albuquerque Journal [edited]<https://www.abqjournal.com/904922/two-more-nm-hantavirus-cases-confirmed.html>A 59-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, both from McKinley County [New Mexico], have confirmed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], marking the 7th and 8th cases in the state this year [2016].Both patients are hospitalized, the New Mexico Department of Health said in a news release Thursday [8 Dec 2016].Hantavirus infection [can cause] a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva, health officials said. People contract it often through inhalation when cleaning up rodent droppings and nesting materials. The deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] is the main carrier for Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus strain found in New Mexico.""As it starts to get cold in the fall, deer mice try and enter our homes for both food and shelter,"" Dr. Paul Ettestad, the department's public health veterinarian, said in a statement. ""Deer mice can get through a hole the size of a dime, so it is important to look around your home and close up any openings that the mice can use to get inside.""State health officials urge the public and health care workers to know the symptoms. Early symptoms of hantavirus include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, and cough, which progresses to respiratory distress, the health department said.Symptoms develop within 1-6 weeks after rodent exposure.There is no specific treatment for HPS, but chances for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early, they said.Prevention steps include: air out closed-up buildings before entering; trap mice until they are all gone; clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant; don't sweep up rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled; put hay, wood and compost piles as far as possible from your home; get rid of trash and junk piles; and don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.Of the 6 previous cases, 4 people died from the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report, taken from the New Mexico Department of Health news release, provides a good summary of the Sin Nombre virus infections in that state this year (2016) and measures that should be taken to avoid exposure to the virus. The report has a good image of the deer mouse, the reservoir host of Sin Nombre virus. The official New Mexico Department of Health news release was sent to ProMED by Dr. Paul Ettestad <Paul.Ettestad@state.nm.us>. That news release also added, ""The other cases of HPS in New Mexico earlier this year include a 25-year-old man from McKinley County who died, a 30-year-old man from San Juan County who died, an 84-year-old man from Santa Fe County who recovered, a 54-year-old man from Cibola County who died, a 37-year-old woman from Sandoval County who recovered, and a 20-year-old woman from Torrance County who died.""
