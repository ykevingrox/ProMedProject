WCVB [edited]<http://www.wcvb.com/news/deadly-tick-disease-on-the-rise-in-new-england/40797908>A disease [virus] found in deer ticks has been on the rise in Massachusetts and New Hampshire for the last few years. According to an article in the journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases, 8 cases of the Powassan virus were reported in Massachusetts and New Hampshire from 2013-2015 [1].Larry Dapsis told the Cape Cod Times that a tick inspection in April [2016] found that Powassan [virus] was active in 4 of the 6 sites surveyed.Two Massachusetts men, ages 49 and 82, have died from the disease; 2 others have neurological and motor control issues because of the disease, the article said.A total of 64 cases of Powassan were reported from 2004-2013 across the country, leading to 7 deaths, or 11 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Symptoms of Powassan can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties, and seizures. Many people who are infected don't develop any symptoms, according to the CDC.Approximately half of the survivors have permanent neurological damage, and the disease can also affect the central nervous system, the CDC said.There are no vaccines or medications to treat or prevent Powassan. Those who might have it should see a doctor right away.[Piantadosi A, Rubin DB, McQuillen DP, et al.

""We didn't think it would be that high,"" he said.Truro was among 6 sites where ticks were collected and tested for Powassan, Dapsis said. Some ticks taken from Brewster, Orleans, and Falmouth also carried the disease [virus], suggesting the illness may have been in the region for a while, he said.""This virus has been on the Cape probably for a number of years,"" Dapsis said. ""It's probably flown under the medical radar screen.""A study published in 1997 marked the 1st time Powassan was documented in New England, said Stephen Rich, professor of microbiology and director of the Laboratory of Medical Zoology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Rich collaborated with Dapsis on the spring inquiry and a smaller examination of the virus conducted last fall [2015] on Cape Cod.Powassan [virus] is transmitted by the bite of a black-legged tick, also known as a deer tick.Dr. Catherine Brown, deputy state epidemiologist and state public health veterinarian said that 9 cases of the disease in people were reported to the state Department of Public Health between 2013 and 2015. The cases were reported in patients in Essex, Norfolk, Middlesex, and Barnstable counties and resulted in one death, she said.Symptoms of Powassan resemble those found in people stricken with the mosquito-borne illnesses West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis, Brown said.Better-known diseases spread by ticks in Massachusetts include Lyme, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis, she said. ""Now, we have another disease that we need to be on the lookout for,"" Brown said.Medical evidence so far suggests Powassan may make some people severely ill, while others could be infected and experience few symptoms, Brown said. ""We are only detecting the very sickest patients,"" she said.Symptoms of Powassan [virus infection] include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties, and seizures, according to a news release about the Cape Cod findings.While there is no treatment for the disease, those stricken are advised to rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration, the statement said.Dapsis said he is seeking grant money to collect ticks from all 15 towns on Cape Cod and test them for Powassan [virus]. The spring inquiry cost about USD 15 000 and was paid for with Barnstable County funds, he said.""We need more information,"" Rich said. ""We don't know why one site is 0 percent and one is 10 percent.""Dapsis said preventing tick bites is the best way to avoid contracting Powassan and similar diseases.Checking skin for ticks, putting clothes in the dryer for 20 minutes to remove ticks, and using repellents registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency are some ways to avoid bites, the statement said.""Our basic message to people is prevent getting the tick bite in the 1st place,"" Dapsis said. ""Protect yourself, protect your yard, and protect your pets.""[Byline: Laura Crimaldi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although no cases of Powassan virus infection have been reported in Massachusetts this year (2016), the virus is present in deer tick vectors (_Ixodes scapulars_) in Cape Cod and represents a threat to human health.The USA CDC notes: ""Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada and Russia. In the United States, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region. These cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer and mid-fall when ticks are most active. POW virus disease cases are rare but the reported number of cases have increased in recent years. All residents of and visitors to areas where POW virus activity has been identified are at risk of infection. People who engage in outdoor work and recreational activities in endemic areas are at increased risk of infection"" (<http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html>).There is no commercially available vaccine for Powassan virus. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid tick bites.A map showing distribution of human cases by state can be accessed at the above CDC URL. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/224>.]
