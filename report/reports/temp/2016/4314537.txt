International Organization for Migration (IOM) [edited]<http://www.iom.int/news/yellow-fever-outbreak-confirmed-dr-congo-iom-trains-border-health-officers>At the request of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s National Border Hygiene Programme, IOM [International Organization for Migration] has trained a 1st group of border health officials as part a national contingency plan to combat an outbreak of yellow fever (YF).The training was held in the town of Matadi, which borders Angola, and was attended by 25 health officers from Kinshasa's Ndjili Airport, Beach Ngobila on the Congo River, and other main border posts in Mbanza Ngungu, Kimpese Lufu, Ango-Ango (Matadi), Boma, Lindu, Yema, Yatch, and Moanda.The workshop was designed to improve participants' understanding of an Integrated Surveillance of Diseases and Response, international health regulations, the management of migration flows during outbreaks, and the registration of suspected cases. Saturnin Phuati Nganzi, who heads the National Border Hygiene Programme, said: ""This 1st training has equipped my team with the right tools to reinforce existing epidemiological surveillance at the borders.""Since an initial outbreak in December 2015, the YF epidemic has killed about 345 people in Angola and continues to gain ground in the DRC. According to a recent statement from the World Health Organization, the DRC has already registered 1044 suspected cases. Some 67 deaths have been confirmed, mainly in the provinces of Bas-UÌ©lÌ©, Kwango Tshuapa, Kongo Centra, and Kinshasa. On 20 Jun [2016] DRC's Minister of Health declared an epidemic.""Migration between Angola and the DRC means that we need a rapid intervention to ensure border health officials are trained and equipped to identify and refer suspected cases to limit the spread of the disease,"" said IOM DRC Chief of Mission Jean-Philippe Chauzy.YF is transmitted by the same mosquitoes that spread the Zika and dengue viruses. The 'yellow' in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients.There is currently almost no YF vaccine left in DRC and a new stock of more than 1 million doses could take weeks to arrive in country, health officials have said. The government is calling on the Congolese population to be vigilant and to scrupulously follow the instructions of the health authorities and take all necessary steps to get vaccinated, especially before travelling to areas at risk and abroad.IOM is also working with its Congolese and international partners to develop a comprehensive approach to improve health interventions at borders and monitor cross-border movements between Angola and the DRC. It is appealing for an initial USD 2.7 million.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Training DRC border health officials should be a helpful preventive measure, given the number of YF virus infected individuals have already crossed this leaky border from Angola into the DRC and that is almost certain to continue. The statement that ""there is practically no YF vaccine in the DRC and new supplies could take weeks to arrive"" is worrisome. The DRC will use dose-splitting (1/5 the normal dose), which will extend coverage.A 27 Jun 2016 report indicated that the DRC says it will begin a campaign next month [July 2016] to vaccinate 11.6 million people against YF after an epidemic was declared in the capital (Kinshasa). Health Minister Felix Kabange said the campaign will begin on 20 Jul 2016 and will aim to vaccinate everyone in the capital of Kinshasa except children under 9 months, and will also target populations in the provinces of Kwango, Lualaba, and Kasai (<http://www.voanews.com/content/congo-vaccination-campaign-yellow-fever/3394896.html>) .It is not clear if the 4-week delay in initiating the vaccination campaign is due to resupply of the vaccine because there are no stocks available, or if the shipment is being made by boat rather than via air. Meanwhile, the risk of ongoing YF virus transmission in the DRC, and especially Kinshasa, is significant. - Mod.TYMaps of the Democratic Republic of the Congo can be seen at <http://www.aefjn.org/tl_files/aefjn-images/im_Africa/im_afr_maps/DRcongomap4.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
