BBC News [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-38103489>The incidence of Lyme disease on Uist is far greater than that on neighbouring islands, according to figures gathered by BBC Gaelic News. [The Uists are a group of islands in the Outer Hebrides, an archipelago off the west coast of Scotland. The main islands of the Outer Hebrides include Lewis and Harris, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, and Barra. North Uist and South Uist are linked by causeways running via Benbecula and Grimsay. For a map of the Uist islands, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides#/media/File:Hebridean_Terrane.png>.]Over the last 4 years, a total of 165 individuals on North Uist, South Uist, and Benbecula have been diagnosed with the disease. In that same period, Lewis and Harris have recorded just 1 case and Barra 3. NHS Western Isles [health board] is developing an awareness campaign for Uist.Lyme disease can cause arthritis and neurological problems if untreated. The infection can be transmitted to humans through a bite from a tick. The figures for incidence of Lyme disease on the Western Isles were provided by medical practices across the islands. The reason of the higher numbers on Uist has still to be fully understood. NHS Western Isles and other groups are investigating.Flu-like symptoms and fatigue are often the first noticeable signs of infection. An untreated bite often shows as a distinctive red circle-like mark on a person's skin. Diagnosed cases of Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but, if left untreated, neurological problems and joint pain can develop months or years later. Ticks are small arthropods related to spiders, mites, and scorpions and Britain has a number of different species. People are most likely to come across sheep ticks, which feed on mammals and birds, in open spaces with long grass or bracken.Hillwalkers and climbers organisation, Mountaineering Scotland, regularly issues advice on how to avoid and deal with ticks. It suggests people can protect themselves better by tucking trousers into socks or wearing gaiters, and also by making thorough checks of their bodies once back home. It recommends that these checks should be repeated over several days. If a tick is found attached to a person's skin, it can be removed with a tick hook. If in doubt, seek advice from a doctor, Mountaineering Scotland says.NHS Western Isles said: ""We are aware of the difference in prevalence across the islands and, as geographically separate islands, we are not surprised that the patterns are different. ""There is different land use in North and South Uist as opposed to Benbecula and this may be related.""We know that some people have expressed their concerns and views about the changing patterns of deer roaming, and the overlap in certain areas of deer and croft animals."" [A croft is a unit of agricultural land (around 12 acres/5 ha]), situated on large estates, and rented from the landowner. There are over 17 000 crofts in Scotland; each croft is listed in the Register of Crofts and most crofts are part of a community of crofts that share common grazing land (<http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/finding_a_place_to_live/crofts_and_crofting/about_crofts_and_crofting>).] The health board already supports efforts to raise awareness of ticks, their presence, and how to remove and treat them. But a spokeswoman added: ""However, we are developing a targeted campaign for the Uists that will focus on prevention of bites, tick removal, and identification and treatment of tick-related disease in people. As tick bites tend to reduce in frequency in the winter, this will be in place prior to the [2017] spring rise in tick prevalence.""Sheep ticks feed on deer, an animal which has been increasingly appearing in villages and gardens on Uist. Scottish Natural Heritage, a public body with a responsibility for managing wild deer numbers, said it was also aware of islanders' concerns about the link between ticks and red deer. A spokesman said: ""We recognise that the deer population in Uist has increased and has been gradually using agricultural land more and moving into villages and gardens. It is a large host and, unlike domestic stock, they are untreated, therefore they play a significant role in spreading ticks into inhabited areas.""In 2015 we brought together stakeholders to set up a voluntary Uist Deer Management Group. We have been supporting the group to develop a deer management plan which takes into account the various interests, including public benefits. This includes reducing agricultural damage, and an aspiration to reduce the tick burden, and also Lyme disease, in agricultural/inhabited areas in the Uists.""Landowner, North Uist Estate Trust, said it was important that the cause of the large number of incidence of the disease was properly understood. A spokesman said: ""We have also noticed a rise in the incidence of Lyme disease over the past 5 years and this is of major concern to us as our stalkers and gamekeepers are particularly at risk. If recent reports are to be believed there is a corresponding rise in many parts of Scotland and it is important that the underlying reasons are properly understood as we are encouraging more people into the countryside each year. Deer play a significant role in the spread of ticks and our local deer group has commissioned a deer plan that advocates a significant reduction in deer numbers. We are currently working to achieve the target cull recommended in the deer plan.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Lyme disease is the most common human tickborne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Lyme disease is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex, a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (<http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf>). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. However, the species of tick vector, the reservoir host species, borrelial genospecies, and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the most common pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. In Europe, _B. garinii_ and _B. afzelii_ are much commoner than _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. _Ixodes scapularis_ is the vector in the eastern and north-central United States and _Ixodes ricinus_ in Europe.Incidence of Lyme disease acquired in England and Wales remains low compared with some other European countries or the US. Public Health England (PHE) recorded between 950 and 1050 cases annually in England and Wales (2011 to 2013), with an incidence of 1.8 cases per 100 000 population (<http://vscg.org/good-practice/published/ticks-and-lyme-disease>). Incidence rates are higher in Scotland; Health Protection Scotland recorded between 228 and 308 cases annually (2007 to 2011), with an incidence of 4.3 cases per 100 000 population (<http://vscg.org/good-practice/published/ticks-and-lyme-disease>). However, because of under-reporting, the true incidence is estimated to be 2-3 times higher.Areas inhabited by deer are particularly suitable habitats for ixodes ticks. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal.Areas in Scotland that are particularly at risk for acquiring Lyme disease are indicated on a map that can be found at <http://d10k7sivr61qqr.cloudfront.net/content/royinterface/13/116/20160140/F2.large.jpg>. The map, however, is missing the Outer Hebrides. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56776>.]
