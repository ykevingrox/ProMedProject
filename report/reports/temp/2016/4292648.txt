The Columbus Dispatch [edited]<http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/06/15/Buckeye-Lake-algae-warnings.html>Warning signs have been placed at Buckeye Lake [Fairfield, Licking, and Perry Counties] boat ramps after tests by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) showed high levels of algae toxins there.ODNR performed the tests last week [week of 6 Jun 2016] after learning that separate, non-recreational tests conducted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency showed high microcystin levels.ODNR testing conducted at the docks and boat lunches showed microcystin levels at 50 parts per billion, said agency spokesman Matt Eiselstein.When microcystin levels exceed 20 parts per billion in recreational waters, state guidelines call for an elevated recreational public health advisory to be issued and a red ""Danger"" sign to be posted, indicating that algae toxins are at unsafe levels and the public should ""avoid all contact with the water.""Those signs were posted [Tue 14 Jun 2016] at the Buckeye Lake boat launches, Eiselstein said.Even when advisories and danger signs are posted, they don't prevent recreational activity such as boating. ""They're an educational outreach type of tool to let people know this is what we found,"" Eiselstein said.Fishing is also still considered safe, though the EPA recommends that those who come in contact with the water should wash their hands, and any fish caught should be rinsed with clean water before consumption.[Byline: Jennifer Smola]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[More information regarding the variety of toxic algae and their dangers is available in the moderator's comment in ProMED-mail post 20160603.4262566.Blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) are the only group of algae to be toxic in freshwaters. They are microscopic bacteria living in water, and are capable of photosynthesising which is why they are often called algae. Though microscopic, when they form colonies and accumulate together they can become visible to the naked eye. Blue-green algae can produce potent liver and neurotoxins as well as skin irritants. However, not all blue-green algae are toxic, and even toxic species do not always produce toxins. But telling the difference in toxic and non-toxic species is challenging. - Mod.TGThe state of Idaho can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18720>.
