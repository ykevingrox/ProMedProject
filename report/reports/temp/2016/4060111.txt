Marianas Variety [edited]<http://www.mvariety.com/cnmi/cnmi-news/local/84171-food-poisoning-downs-15-persons-including-tourists>At least 15 individuals, including 9 tourists, were brought to the Commonwealth Health Center last week [week of 22 Feb 2016], 3 hours after they had lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Garapan [Saipan Island, Northern Mariana Islands, NMI]. The 15 included a family of 4 and their housekeeper who were brought to the hospital later in the evening.According to a nurse, the patients ate barracuda served in the restaurant and a portion of the fish was taken from the restaurant to a family who consumed the fish during dinner. The cook at the restaurant was likewise brought to the hospital, suffering from severe pain. One of the victims told Variety that she felt all her muscles weakening and that she nearly fainted. Variety was told that one of the tourists decided to return to China to get ""better treatment"" for food poisoning.A local fisherman said barracuda, especially the huge ones, are not safe for human consumption. ""While they may be a delicacy in other places, here in the NMI they are considered dangerous because they are contaminated with toxins from World War II relics in the sea,"" he said.According to Wikipedia, the barracuda is ""a ray-finned fish known for its large size and fearsome appearance. Its body is long, fairly compressed, and covered with small, smooth scales. Some species can reach up to 2.1 m (6.9 ft) in length and 30 cm (12 in) in width.""[Byline: Junhan B Todino]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although not specifically mentioned, the association of barracuda ingestion and neurological symptoms suggests that this episode is due to ciguatera fish poisoning.The following is taken from CDC: Cluster of ciguatera fish poisoning -- North Carolina, 2007. MMWR 2009; 58(11): 283-5 (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5811a3.htm>; edited; original citation numbering retained):""Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the most potent sodium channel toxins known (3). Carnivorous tropical and semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on plant-eating fish that have ingested _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ or another member of the _Gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters (4). Gambiertoxins from _Gambierdiscus_ spp. are converted into more potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. Spoilage of fish that have been caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not deactivate the toxin. Humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). The attack rate can be as high as 80 to 90 per cent in persons who eat affected fish, depending on the amount of toxin in the fish.""Persistence or recurrence of neurologic symptoms are hallmarks of CFP [ciguatera fish poisoning]. 3 of the 9 patients in this cluster had recurrences of one or more symptoms for more than 6 months after their initial illness. If these patients are again exposed to fish (either ciguatoxin-contaminated or even non-contaminated fish), their symptoms likely will be more severe than those experienced with their initial episodes of CFP (3).""Variations in the geographic distribution of the various ciguatoxins might explain regional differences in symptom patterns. CFP symptoms associated with eating fish from the Pacific Ocean are primarily neurologic, and symptoms associated with eating fish from the Caribbean Sea are more commonly gastrointestinal (4). Amberjack often is linked to CFP cases in the Caribbean. Although the amberjack fish responsible for this cluster of CFP cases tested positive for C-CTX-1, it was not tested for the presence of other ciguatoxins, which also might have been present and could have altered disease presentation (7).""CFP has been associated almost exclusively with eating fish caught in tropical or semitropical waters, but increased global marketing of these species has increased the possibility that persons in temperate zones might become ill with CFP (4). Moreover, warming seawaters might expand the ranges of ciguatoxin-contaminated fish (8). In the USA, such fish have been found as far north as the coastal waters of North Carolina. Despite underreporting, CFP now is considered one of the most common illnesses related to fish consumption in the USA (9).""Any level of ciguatoxin 0.1 ppb [parts per billion] or more of fish tissue is thought to pose a health risk (3). As this illness becomes more common in nontropical areas of the world, clinicians need to be aware of its manifestations and how to manage it. Although opinions vary on the most effective course of treatment, intravenous mannitol has been a mainstay of management of neurologic symptoms for more than 20 years. Early mannitol treatment is considered more effective, but anecdotal evidence suggests that even delayed therapy benefits some patients. Amitriptyline also has been useful in relieving some of the neurologic symptoms of CFP (10). If evaluating a possible case, clinicians should consult their local poison control center for the latest treatment guidelines.References----------3. Pearn J: Neurology of ciguatera.
