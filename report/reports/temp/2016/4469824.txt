Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[After years of relative calm, this epidemic in northeast France is a re-educating experience. Once these districts return to their normal state, it will be necessary to implement a compulsory annual vaccination policy each spring for at least the next 5-6 years. The losses in the early affected herds have been significant, reflecting a slow reaction in each case. As the farmers became more aware, the losses were minimal. A lesson to be shared. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>.]
