BioBioChile [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/nacional/region-de-los-lagos/2016/09/13/confirman-posible-contagio-de-virus-hanta-en-hombre-de-puerto-montt.shtml>A suspected case of a hantavirus infection was confirmed by the Epidemiology Department of the Los Lagos Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional ministry of health]. This information was confirmed by epidemiologist Cristian Rosas, who indicated that the individual was a 62 year old man, resident of Puerto Montt, but who had become infected in the Lauca area near Calbuco [in the Los Lagos region].The epidemiologist confirmed the probable hantavirus case and added that the patient is currently in stable condition and hospitalized in Puerto Montt. Cristian Rosas stated that a SEREMI team went to the place where the individual probably could have become infected in order to obtain samples [from people or from rodents? - Mod.TY].Recall that in order to reduce cases of hantavirus [infections] in the region, regional authorities and directors of various institutions that work in the area form a working group in light of an increase in temperatures and deficit of moisture that signifies greater contact with long-tail rodents [reservoirs of Andes virus].[byline: Alejandro Alarc√å n]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 2nd case of a hantavirus infection acquired in the Los Lagos region this year (2016) that ProMED-mail has posted. As noted in the previous post (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160204.3995193), the Los Lagos region is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The above report provides little information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infections, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta.Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and of Region de Los Lagos at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4961>. - Mod.TY]
