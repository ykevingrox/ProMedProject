Prensa Latina [edited]<http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4585671&Itemid=1>The number of people killed in Angola by yellow fever [YF] rose to 26, informed today [6 Feb 2016] the National Director of Public Health, Adelaide de Carvalho.In Luanda, since December [2015], the cases confirmed are 96, but the outbreak, that began in the capital municipality of Viana was detected in the provinces of Huila, Huambo, and Kwanza South, told De Carvalho to a Portuguese agency quoted by Angonoticias site.A mega-campaign to combat the disease began this week [week of 1 Feb 2016] in Viana, but then it will be extended to the other districts of the capital, informed the Health Minister Jose Van-Dunem.The campaign includes awareness campaigns in populations to strengthen the preventive measures such as putting the lids on the water containers; placing burned oil in puddles; and protecting themselves against mosquito bites.Also among the measures is the distribution of mini-doses of Bactivec (water disinfectant), treatments against mosquito larvae breeding sites, intra- and extra-domiciliary fumigation, as well as vaccination, especially to children.It is estimated that 130 000 cases of this disease are registered each year, causing about 44 000 deaths in endemic African countries, where 90 percent of infections of the world are reported.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of yellow fever (YF) cases in Angola is accelerating. On 2 Feb 2016, there were 84 registered cases and now there are 96 cases, 12 more in just 3 days. It is odd that no mention is made of a vaccination campaign as part of the ""mega-campaign."" However, the 3 Feb 2016 report indicated that on Tue 2 Feb 2016, a vaccination campaign that intends to reach 1.5 million children in Viana municipality was initiated. There was no mention of vaccination in the other affected provinces, Huila, Huambo, and Kwanza South, in the earlier report or in this one. Increased surveillance with rapid laboratory support, as well as vigorous action including vaccination and vector control are necessary to bring the outbreak in these affected localities under control before they spread further.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>; of Viana in relation to Luanda at <http://becoangola.com/imagens/viana.gif>; and a map showing the provinces of Angola at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/angola/angola-political-map.html>. - Mod.TY]
