Over the past 11 days, there have been 108 salmonellosis cases reported in South Australia, which normally sees around 15 to 20 cases each year.Since the start of December 2015, SA Health has been notified of 233 cases of salmonellosis. Of these 233 cases, 43 people have been hospitalized.""Our investigations have indicated to us that it is likely that the consumption of raw bean sprouts is contributing to this increase,"" said SA Health's chief public health officer, Professor Paddy Phillips. ""As a result, we are today [21 Apr 2016] advising South Australians to cook all bean sprouts and avoid eating raw bean sprouts. We also want to alert food retailers such as restaurants and cafes not to serve raw bean sprouts until further notice. We are working closely with the producers, suppliers and handlers of the sprouts and are continuing to investigate,"" he said.Bean sprouts -- not to be confused with snow pea sprouts -- are commonly used in stir fries, salads and noodle dishes and are served alongside popular Asian dishes like pho.According to the Food Safety Information Council, outbreaks of foodborne illness, both in Australia and overseas, have been associated with eating seed sprouts. In 2005, a salmonellosis outbreak in WA of 125 cases was linked to alfalfa sprouts, and a 2006 salmonellosis outbreak of 15 cases in Victoria was linked to alfalfa sprouts.To eat bean sprouts, the FSIC recommend safely adhering to the use by date displayed on seed sprout packaging, follow storage directions, and always store seed sprouts at 5 C [41 F] or below.Consumers should avoid cross contamination from other risky foods such as meat or poultry. Washing sprouts has been found to be not very effective, as laboratory studies have shown that bacteria can be internalized in the sprouts, making it difficult to wash off and sanitise, and bacteria can be protected in a biofilm on the sprout surface. People in the 4 vulnerable demographics -- young children, people over 70, the immunocompromised, or pregnant -- should not eat uncooked sprouts of any kind.[byline: Rebecca Sullivan, Vanessa Brown]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ is not stated.
