The Press-Enterprise [edited]<http://www.pe.com/articles/nile-792250-west-deaths.html>California was hit with a record 45 deaths from West Nile virus in 2015 -- a number that eclipses deaths from the disease in every other state and far surpasses those reported in California, the most populated state, in any other year.While not a record, California's 737 West Nile cases last year [2015] also dwarf the disease's impact elsewhere in the country. Texas, the state with the next largest population, is 2nd highest with 252 cases. Colorado had 101 cases and the rest had fewer than 100 -- most, far fewer.That many deaths and cases mean West Nile reached an epidemic level in the state, said UC [University of California] Riverside entomology department vice chair Bill Walton, who researches mosquito control in wetlands, including use of bacteria rather than pesticides.The number of West Nile deaths reported to California's public health department in 2015 -- all but 3 of those deaths in Southern California -- was nearly 50 per cent more than the state's previous high of 31 deaths in 2014, the state's West Nile virus website shows.California's 45 deaths outstrip those in the 5 states with the next highest numbers: Texas had 11, Illinois and Oklahoma each had 7, Arizona had 6 and Maryland had 5, according to statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""It's the highest we've ever had,"" said scientist Chris Barker, whose UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine research group studies invasive mosquitoes and mosquitoborne virus outbreaks. ""There's no doubt that is a concern.""People who work or play outside are at highest risk for West Nile. People over 60 or with certain medical conditions have the most chance of developing severe illness.Last year [2015], West Nile virus also reached an epidemic, record-breaking level in Riverside County. The county, with roughly 2.3 million people, had 138 confirmed and probable human cases and 6 deaths. That shattered previous records of 116 cases in 2004 and 5 deaths set in 2005.Los Angeles County, except for Long Beach and Pasadena which have their own mosquito control programs, reported 265 cases and 18 deaths. Orange County had 97 cases and 7 deaths. San Bernardino County, with 2.1 million residents, reported 53 cases and 3 deaths last year, as of [12 Nov 2015].Scientists and the vector control community try to quantify why mosquito-borne viruses are worse in certain years, but can't completely explain it, said Doug Osborn, Riverside County Vector Control Program supervisor. California's sheer size, in terms of population, is part of the answer. Mosquito species in each state play a role. California has about 54, with 2 or 3 major West Nile carriers [vectors], Walton said.Other factors include the severe drought, rainfall patterns, longer periods of hot temperatures, and the number and types of mosquitoes that transmit the disease as well as birds that are reservoirs or hosts of the virus, experts say.[byline: Suzanne Hurt]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in most of the continental states of the USA since its introduction into North America in 1999. Since its introduction, annual case numbers in given states such as California have been variable. Vector control and public education to avoid mosquito bites are the best measures to prevent human cases. Equine animals can be vaccinated, but there is no commercially available vaccine for human use.ProMED-mail subscribers interested in reported occurrence of WNV cases are reminded that a CDC/USGS map of human cases by county can be accessed at <http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/preliminarymapsdata/index.html> and a similar map for Canada at <http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/diseases-conditions-maladies-affections/disease-maladie/west-nile-nil-occidental/surveillance-eng.php>. The CDC/USGS maps also include county reports of equine cases, sentinel animal detection, and WNV-positive mosquitoes.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the USA showing the location of California can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204> and a map showing the locations of the California counties mentioned at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/states/california/california-county-map.html>. - Mod.TY]
