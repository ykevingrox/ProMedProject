Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-02-27-001.aspx>As of 12:00 noon today [27 Feb 2016] there have been a total of:1306 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including555 fatalities [reported case fatality rate 42.5 percent]742 recoveries, and9 currently active casesIn the past 24 hours there have been:1 newly confirmed case1 newly reported fatality and0 newly reported recoveriesInformation on newly reported fatal case:- A 50-year-old Saudi male from Mahail Aseer, non-healthcare worker, who was reported as dead at the initial confirmation report. He had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. He was reported to be a primary case with a history of exposure to camels.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Cases are continuing to occur in Saudi Arabia. With the addition of the newly confirmed case, there have now been a total of 23 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection since 1 Jan 2016, and the 4th such individual who was noted to have died at the time of the initial report. Of these 23 newly confirmed cases, 18 (78.3 percent) were reported to be primary infections, 14 of whom had a history of direct or indirect contact with camels.The location of this case can be seen on the map available at the source URL. As there is a town called Muhayail located in Asir province, I suspect this is the location referred to. What is noteworthy here is that the 14 primary cases with a history of contact with camels were reported by 11 different locations (Bisha, Madinah, Al Modhannab, Jeddah, Alkhumra, Alkharj, Taif, Afeef, Najran, Hail, Mahail Aseer), highlighting the sporadic nature of occurrence, but also highlighting the geographic dispersion of MERS-CoV positive camels in Saudi Arabia.It remains a curiosity as to why this is occurring in such relatively high frequency in Saudi Arabia and not other countries in the Arabian Peninsula? Is this a demonstration of my favorite adage -- seek and ye shall find -- or are there cultural differences in terms of types of contact with juvenile camels?The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
