PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update Yellow Fever [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=36143>Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------In 2015, 3 countries in the Americas confirmed circulation of yellow fever virus: Bolivia reported epizootic and Brazil and Peru reported human cases.In 2016, as of epidemiological week (EW) 34 [21-27 Aug 2016], 3 countries had reported jungle yellow fever: Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.Between EW 1 and EW 34 of 2016 [3 Jan-27 Aug 2016], Brazil has reported 3 cases of yellow fever, 2 autochthonous and one imported from Angola. The autochthonous cases were reported in Bady Bassit in SÌ£o Paulo state and in the state of GoiÌÁs.In Colombia, between EW 1 and EW 35 of 2016 [3 Jan-3 Sep 2016], a total of 17 jungle yellow fever cases have been reported (5 laboratory-confirmed and 12 probable). The confirmed yellow fever case in the department of VaupÌ©s is the 1st documented yellow fever case in that department. Of the total cases, 82 per cent are male (14 cases) and 47 per cent of the total (8 cases) are between the ages of 25 to 29 years. Out of 17 cases, 4 are indigenous. 4 out of 5 of the confirmed cases died (case fatality rate [CFR]: 80 per cent).The distribution of confirmed and probable cases by department is shown in table 1 and in figure 2 [available at the source URL above]. Given the confirmation of cases in the Vichada Department (bordering the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) as well as in the ChocÌ  Department (bordering Panama) there is a risk of the circulation of the virus in both of the bordering countries, especially in areas with the same ecosystem.Table 1.

The municipality of La Macarena is an area characterized by a significant influx of foreign and domestic tourists.Yellow fever in Colombia in the last 10 years---------------------------------------------In 2005, coinciding with the occurrence of the El NiÌ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Colombia reported a total of 20 confirmed cases of jungle yellow fever. The cases were recorded in the departments of CaquetÌÁ (10 cases), Putumayo (8 cases), Guaviare (1), and Santander (1). Between 2006 and 2008, Colombia reported 15 cases of jungle yellow fever (CFR: 100 per cent) in the departments of CaquetÌÁ, Casanare, Guaviare, Meta, Norte de Santander, Putumayo, and Vichada. In 2009, 5 cases of jungle yellow fever were confirmed in the department of Meta.Between 2010 and 2012, no cases of yellow fever were reported in Colombia. In 2013, a case was recorded in the department of CaquetÌÁ. No cases were reported between 2014 and 2015.In Peru, up to EW 34 of 2016 [week ending 27 Aug 2016], there were 85 cases of jungle yellow fever reported. Of the reported cases, 62 were confirmed and 23 were categorized as probable. Out of the 25 departments in Peru, cases have been reported in 8 departments, with the department of JunÌ n reporting most of confirmed and probable cases (57 cases). The jungle yellow fever outbreak in JunÌ n is confined to 11 districts of the provinces of Chanchamayo and Satipo.The number of confirmed and probable cases reported in Peru between EW 1 and EW 34 of 2016 [3 Jan-27 Aug 2016] (85), exceeds the number of cases (confirmed and probable) reported in the previous 9 years (Figure 3 [available at the source URL above]). The cases are mostly in young adults and economically active persons, between the ages of 25 to 49 years (52 out of 85 cases). The majority of the cases are: farmers, informal miners, and persons who entered into the jungle area.Vaccine supply--------------For years the global supply of yellow fever vaccine has been insufficient. Through the PAHO/WHO Revolving Fund about 50 per cent of the demand received through this mechanism is met. The Revolving Fund assigns the allocation of the available supplies to countries based on epidemiological risk. Together with the WHO and UNICEF, the Revolving Fund jointly participates in meeting the challenges of vaccine supply.The outbreak in Angola [and the Democratic Republic of the Congo] has reduced existing supplies of yellow fever vaccine. During outbreaks, the available vaccine doses are given priority to respond to emergencies. At the end of March 2016, thanks to the collaboration of partners such as the International Coordination Group (ICG) and UNICEF the global stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergencies was replenished.Recommendations---------------The recommendations indicated in the PAHO/WHO Yellow Fever Epidemiological Update of 26 Jul 2016 remain in effect [the recommendations in effect were issued in the Yellow Fever Epidemiological Alert of 31 Dec 2015 and are available at <http://bit.ly/2cpOUiW>].--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Unlike the current yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, now ending, the scattered cases in South America are sylvatic (forest or jungle) cases, not urban cases. There has not been an urban transmission cycle outbreak in South America since the one in 2008 in Paraguay. Fortunately, that one was recognized early on and the swift response by the Ministry of Health quickly brought it to an end, although initially there was a scramble to obtain enough vaccine for a nationwide campaign. The risk of a YF urban outbreak in South America remains should an individual become infected from YF virus spill-over from monkeys and then travel to areas where _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present. That risk, however small, argues for maintaining good vaccination coverage nationally. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of South America can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>]
