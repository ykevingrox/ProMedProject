""PC"" was cleared this month [September 2016] of professional misconduct charges following an investigation by the NMC. It accused her of concealing her high temperature on returning to the UK from Ebola-hit Sierra Leone in 2014.Allegations against nurses and midwives will no longer be available for public scrutiny ahead of disciplinary hearings, The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) has said.The NMC, which was criticized over its handling of the charges against ""PC"", has decided to no longer publish allegations on its website. Instead, the charges will be read out at the start of disciplinary hearings and will be circulated only on request. The move means the public and the media will be prevented from reading the charges in advance.][One can only hope this will prevent the media circus that surrounded the accidental infections of health care workers that occurred during the West African Ebola outbreak. - Mod.LK]1 Oct 2016 Sierra Leone, USA: America extends immigration status for Sierra Leonean and Liberian citizens<http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/?p=13796>[Less than a week after Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson re-authorized an extension of 6 months of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) assigned to Ebola Affected Countries, namely Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum Wed [28 Sep 2016] directing Secretary Johnson to implement an 18 month Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberian Citizens in the United States through 31 Mar 2018, according to a press release on the White House website.President Obama's DED directive will automatically extend work permits for Liberians who were forced to flee from their country to the US because of an 11-year civil war.]Research--------26 Sep 2016: New research clarifies how cells take in cholesterol and offers insight on Ebola<http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2016/09/26/new-research-clarifies-how-cells-take-in-cholesterol-and-offers-insight-on-ebola/>[According to GÃŒ nter Blobel, head of the Laboratory of Cell Biology: ""By examining the structures and interaction of 2 cholesterol-transporting proteins in unprecedented detail, we now better understand an aspect of this complex process: How cells prepare to properly use cholesterol they have imported,"" Blobel says.

These data provide key information related to the mechanism by which these proteins catalyze cholesterol transport and form the basis for a molecular model for how cholesterol is transferred from NPC2 onto NPC1 protein.]Characterization of the Unconventional Secretion of the Ebola Matrix Protein VP40.<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27665561>[Citation.Reynrad O, Mateo M.

Methods Mol Biol 2016;1459:205-13. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3804-9_14.Abstract.While most secreted proteins use the classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi secretion pathway to reach the extracellular medium, a few proteins are secreted through unconventional secretary pathways. Viral proteins can be secreted through unconventional secretion pathways. Here, we describe how we have recently demonstrated that the Ebola virus (EBOV) matrix protein VP40 is released from transfected and infected cells in a soluble form through an unconventional secretion pathway.]26 Sep 2016: Aerosolization of Ebola Virus Surrogates in Wastewater Systems<https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/73043>[Citation.Lin K. (EPub 26 Sep 2016). Aerosolization of Ebola Virus Surrogates in Wastewater Systems. Virginia Tech Master Theses.Abstract.""Recent studies have shown that Ebola virus can persist in wastewater, and the potential for the virus to be aerosolized and pose a risk of inhalation exposure has not been evaluated. We considered this risk for 3 wastewater systems: toilets, a lab-scale model of an aeration basin, and a lab-scale model of converging sewer pipes. We measured the aerosol size distribution generated by each system, spiked Ebola virus surrogates into each system, and determined the emission rate of viruses into the air. ... Since information on the aerosolization of Ebola virus is quite limited, these emission rates can greatly help inform risk assessment of inhalation exposure to Ebola virus.""]28 Sep 2016: Following Flaw In Ebola Data Management, WHO And QU Introduce New Data Tool Kit<http://news.mynahcare.com/research/following-flaw-in-ebola-data-management-who-and-qu-introduce-new-data-tool-kit>[Research conducted by the University of Queensland found serious faults in the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] data management system, which contributed to the poor performance of the system during the EVD outbreak. A large list of Ebola cases were found with incomplete investigation, late arrivals, double entries in the database, and lack of processing confirmed deaths and cases which were being held for treatment.The University of Queensland and the World Health Organization (WHO) have now developed an efficient tool kit, which will be helpful in managing data during any future epidemics.]Economy--------27 Sep 2016: Sierra Leone H1 Diamond Exports 347 000 Carats Following Recovery from Ebola<http://www.thediamondloupe.com/articles/2016-09-28/sierra-leone-h1-diamond-exports-347000-carats-following-recovery-ebola>[According to the country's Diamond Dealers Club, Sierra Leone exported 347 070 carats of diamonds in the 1st half of this year [2016]. Club President Federico Candiano told Rough and Polished the country generated USD 188.9 million in revenue during the period. This includes USD 145 011 552 from mining licenses and USD 43.8 million from mining trader licenses. Mr. Candiano said: ""The 2nd half [of 2016] should mark a positive increase due to the seasonal washing in the rainy season.""Sierra Leone exported 500 039 carats valued at USD 154 million last year [2015], a 20-percent decline from the 2014 figure. Last year's output was hit hard by the Ebola outbreak, which saw some operations shutting down as debts increased and investors pulled out. However, the situation was now improving.
