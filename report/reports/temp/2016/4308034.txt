Roger was an early One Health advocate and proponent of new PCR-based diagnostic testing technologies and a strong advocate for the adoption of standardized PCR diagnostic testing methodologies for humans and animals.Dr. Breeze was a Member of the UK Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and a member of the U.S. National Academies - Institute of Medicine's Forum on Microbial Threats and National Academies - Committee on Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures. For the past decade, Roger served as an advisor on biosecurity and biological/chemical weapons nonproliferation issues to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Roger Breeze received the Presidential Distinguished Executive Rank Award in 1998 for his current work as Associate Administrator for Special Research Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) to establish and direct a new program for counterterrorism and biological weapons defense for U.S. agriculture and food supply chains, and previous work as Director of the USDA - Plum Island Animal Disease Center. At Plum Island, Dr. Breeze supervised a major renovation and modernization of the laboratory facilities and implemented a redesign of existing biosafety and biosecurity practices. He initiated new research programs into the genomic basis of disease pathogenesis, genetically engineered vaccine development, and real-time PCR diagnostic tests.  Roger fostered the establishment of a worldwide network of international cooperative research programs whose legacy continues through to the present day.Before joining USDA-ARS, Roger had a distinguished academic career in the United Kingdom and the United States. Dr. Breeze received his Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery and a PhD in Veterinary Pathology from the University of Glasgow and was a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  He was engaged in teaching and research on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases pathology at the University of Glasgow - School of Veterinary Medicine and the Washington State University - College of Veterinary Medicine. While at Washington State University, Roger Breeze served as Chairman of the Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology and Associate Dean for Research in the College of Veterinary Medicine before moving on to become Deputy Director of the Washington Technology Center at the University of Washington - College of Engineering.To his colleagues, Roger may be most remembered for his engaging and inclusive personality, his exuberance and enthusiasm, his collegiality, and his singular ability to make the un-seeable appear self-evident.--Joe Dudley, Billy Karesh, Terry Leighton, Tracey McNamara[Roger was always a good friend and stimulating colleague and donated some valuable equipment to my lab in Brazil. - Mod.JW][Roger was a well-regarded speaker at the first IMED in 2007 and has been a friend of ProMED through ensuing years, advocating for us within DTRA. We are saddened to learn of his death. - Mod.LM].................................................lm/mhj/jw/lm/msp/lm"
