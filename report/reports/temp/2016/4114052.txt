Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/egypt-reports-4th-human-h5n1-avian-influenza-case-2nd-from-giza-76084/>An individual from Giza, Egypt is the 4th confirmed human H5N1 avian influenza case reported in 2016, according to a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This is the 2nd case reported from Giza; the others were reported in Sohag and Cairo. This follows a record year in H5N1 cases in Egypt in 2015, when more than 160 cases were seen.Since the 1st human cases were recorded in 2003, the World Health Organization puts the global total 846 cases and 449 deaths as of [25 Feb 2016].H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or ""bird flu""). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent.Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual.[byline: Robert Herriman]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[With the latest H5N1 case, the total number of confirmed cases in Egypt since 2003 now stands at 348, and the global total is 848 (449 confirmed deaths as of last WHO update, dated 25 Feb 2016 <http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2016_02_25_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1>).According to a WHO EMRO region report published 15 May 2015 (<http://www.emro.who.int/egy/egypt-news/upsurge-h5n1-human-poultry-cases-may-2015.html>), ""The recent increase in the number of people affected by the avian influenza virus H5N1 in Egypt is not related to virus mutations, but rather to more people becoming exposed to infected poultry, according to a recent mission of 6 organizations assessing the H5N1 situation in the country. Since November 2014 to 30 Apr 2015, the period analysed by the international mission, a total of 165 cases, including 48 deaths were reported. This is by far the highest number of human cases ever reported by a country over a similar period. There are indications that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and in all parts of Egypt.""(Maps of Egypt can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8480>.Giza is the 3rd-largest city in Egypt.
