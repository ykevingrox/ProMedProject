EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]Re: Rabies - Americas (20): USA (RI) susp mink, human exposures Archive Number: 20160707.4329963 [The following responses were received from EpiCore Surveillance Project members that wish to remain anonymous.] [1]""I have seen a mink in the Cliff Walk in Newport RI that was at least 2 -3 years ago. She/he seemed to be a local resident in a burrow. Did not act as rabid at the time. That I am aware, we do not have cases if wild or domestic rabies in Newport County, (Aquinas Island, East RI).""[2]""The 'black' description from the Providence Journal indicative of a lack of color variation provides evidence towards the identification of the animal as a mink, contrary to presumptions of it being a ferret. As an American Mink (Neovison vison) in New England, it was likely of the subspecies Eastern (N. v. vison) or Common (N. v. mink). This being said, the lack of nocturnality, lack of mention of gland secretion, and general ground level activity west of the heavily wooded areas of Woody Hill and Burlingame provides evidence towards the possibility of rabies or other neurotropic behavior modifying infection. This is all under the assumption that local authorities would be able to determine if it was a Fisher (Martes pennant), due to their endemic presence north of Westerly. Identification is easy due to their large size in comparison to other members of the Mustelidae. Other possibilities include the Long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), but this is unlikely due to their lighter coloration.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The information received from EpiCore Surveillance Project is much appreciated. - Mod MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/241>.]
