Since the 1st of the year [2016], there have been 32 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Buraidah, including one individual originally reported from Hail, but later attributed to the ongoing nosocomial transmission. In Hail, there have been 5 cases reported since the beginning of the year, including the individual who was later reported to be associated with the ongoing outbreak in Buraidah. Of these 5 cases, 4 were reported to be in a critical condition at the time of initial report, and the 5th, today's [27 Mar 2016] reported case, was reported as a fatality at the time of initial report.The Saudi MOH website has now added a column on the website to identify those individuals where contact with camels is unknown at the time of investigation. It would be of interest to know how many of the previously reported primary cases classified as no contact with camels had unknown camel contact histories at the time of initial confirmation report.Maps showing the locations of the newly reported cases, deaths and recoveries can be found at the source URL.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
