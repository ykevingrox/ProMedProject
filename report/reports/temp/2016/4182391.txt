It is now 16 days since identification of the MERS-CoV infection in this patient, and to date, there have been no secondary cases reported from Bahrain.The case was reported by Bahrain and died the same day as transfer to Saudi Arabia, hence it appears as though the case has not been reported a 2nd time by Saudi Arabia.In the 2 days since the last ProMED-mail update on MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, there have not been new cases or new outcomes on previously confirmed cases reported by the Saudi MOH, in keeping with the trend for decreased transmission during the month of April 2016.The HealthMap/ProMED map of the region showing Saudi Arabia and Bahrain can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
