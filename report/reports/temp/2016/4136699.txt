The patient developed fever and other symptoms in Angola on 17 Mar [2016]. On 19 Mar [2016] he arrived at Shanghai's Pudong Airport and that night arrived in Fuzhou City. He is now undergoing treatment at a hospital in Fuzhou City.A patient, 36 years old, female, of Fuqing City, Fuzhou Municipality, Fujian Province, was in Luanda, Angola long-term doing business. On 15 Mar [2016], she developed fever and other symptoms in Angola. On 21 Mar [2016], she arrived at Shanghai's Pudong Airport. That night, she arrived in Fuzhou City and is now undergoing treatment at a hospital in Fuzhou City.A patient, female, 53 years old, of Fuqing City in Fuzhou Municipality, Fujian Province, was in Luanda, Angola doing business long-term. The patient became ill on 13 Mar [2016], and on 21 Mar [2016] arrived by plane in Fuzhou City. She is now undergoing treatment at a hospital in Fuzhou.On 31 Mar [2016], a specialist team from Fujian Province Health & Family Planning confirmed the above 3 new cases of imported yellow fever based on [their] histories, clinical presentation and the results of nucleic acid testing. At the moment, the patients are all in isolation in hospital receiving treatment. Their conditions are stable and they are in decent spirits. [There is one case previous to these 3.]Disease control specialists remind everyone that vaccination is the most important precaution. People traveling to yellow fever epidemic zones should receive yellow fever vaccination 10 days prior to departure. People returning from Angola and other yellow fever epidemic areas should promptly visit medical institutions and tell physicians their histories if they have fever or other symptoms.[Byline: Chen Hongyi]--Communicated by:Dan Silver<dgsilver@yahoo.com>******[2] Details, 4th case in FujianDate: Sat 2 Apr 2016Source: Fujian Entry-Exit Inspection & Quarantine Bureau of P.R.C.

Screens 1 Imported Case of Yellow Fever in a Chinese National Returning from Angola--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This case is the 4th publicly reported case of imported yellow fever in Fujian Province. The patient is a female, 53 years old, of Fuqing City in Fuzhou Municipality, Fujian Province.The patient fell ill on 13 Mar 2016 and sought treatment at a local hospital in Angola. On 15 Mar 2016 her symptoms improved and her temperature returned to normal.On 21 Mar 2016 she took a flight via Ethiopia and transferred at Shanghai to arrive in Fuzhou City. On 25 Mar 2016, she brought herself to the Fujian International Travel Clinic under Fujian Entry-Exit Inspection & Quarantine Bureau of P.R.C. Initial laboratory nucleic acid screening results were positive for yellow fever. The case was confirmed as an imported case of yellow fever by Fujian Province Center for Disease Control & Prevention.--Communicated by:Dan Silver<dgsilver@yahoo.com>[This is the same case, that of a 53-year-old woman, reported above. Of concern is that these flights from Angola make intermediate stops, such as Ethiopia mentioned above, no doubt to change flights in order to arrive back in China. This raises questions about the presence of vector mosquitoes such as _Aedes aegypti_ in the airports where the passengers have layovers while changing flights.Proof of yellow fever (YF) vaccination should be required for travelers in order to disembark in YF endemic countries such as Angola. Had that regulation been in place, we would not be seeing these YF cases turning up in China.Dan Silver made these observations [edited]:1) All 3 of these patients are, again, Chinese citizens doing ""business"" (or ""trading"") in Angola. The implication is that they don't work for big companies. They may be traveling independently to Angola (possibly even via 3rd countries) and not receiving vaccinations prior to arrival, i.e. falling through the cracks.2) At least 2 of them developed symptoms in Angola before returning to China, but were missed at the airport when they entered China, despite being ill.3) Chinese citizens who fall ill in Angola want to head back to China for treatment (perhaps especially these kinds of independent businesspeople). I found a BBS posting recommending this -- head back to China if you think you have yellow fever, with details of what to expect/do once home.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. A map of China can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Mod.TY][It is urgent to get more vaccine into Angola to protect both the rest of Angola outside Luanda and the unvaccinated Chinese workers and other foreign nationals who may be returning home sick to dengue-endemic countries such as India. If yellow fever begins to spread in one of those countries, millions of doses will be needed. - Mod.JW]
