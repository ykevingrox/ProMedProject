WBAP [edited]<http://www.wbap.com/2016/12/09/mumps-outbreak-in-johnson-co-grows>One of the centers of a national mumps outbreak is in North Texas. The health department reported 10 confirmed cases a week ago. There are now 37, and more are expected to be diagnosed. About half of the cases are among students in the Keene Independent School District [ISD]. The other half are students in Cleburne ISD. There are also 6 adult cases confirmed among staff members at the schools.Johnson County's health director expects to see more cases through the new year [2017], but he said that after the susceptible population gets it, no one else will.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap showing the location of Texas, United States can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]******[2] Risk in collegesDate: Tue 13 Dec 2016Source: Education Dive [edited]<http://www.educationdive.com/news/colleges-at-center-of-new-mumps-outbreak/432230/>CBS News reports on a resurgence in mumps infections throughout the United States, with more than 2800 cases reported this year [2016], nearly double the number of confirmed illnesses in 2015.The University of Missouri, which has reported nearly 200 cases of mumps infection this academic year [2016-17], has asked students to refrain from throwing social engagements on campus and asked students to avoid public places like bars in order to stem the outbreak.Harvard University [Massachusetts] and the State University of New York have each reported more than 60 confirmed mumps cases since last spring [2016], joining dozens of other campuses facing control issues with the disease commonly caused by exposure to sneezing, coughing or sharing cups and utensils.For many colleges and universities, the greatest challenge is not in identifying or treating outbreaks among students but in trying to force students to change their social habits so that infection can be properly contained.From a public relations perspective, colleges which deliver information about the infection and quarantine instructions are best prepared for questions from parents, students and the media, and are the most likely to avoid suffering negative reactions in enrollment or coverage according to how transparent they can be about causes and responses to illness outbreaks.[Byline: Jarrett Carter]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Risk of infection with mumps (and measles) in colleges is high because of waning immunity following childhood vaccination with MMR and close associations among students in such settings. See recent mumps posts for discussion of waning immunity, especially against mumps, following MMR vaccine. While a 3rd vaccine prior to entering college may help control outbreaks, it may not be cost-effective. An alternative approach is to educate students about preventive practices and isolation to control virus transmission once an infected student is identified. - Mod.LKA HealthMap of the United States may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]******[3] WashingtonDate: Tue 13 Dec 2016Source: Patch [edited]<http://patch.com/washington/renton/mumps-outbreak-63-cases-5-local-cities>There are now mumps cases in 5 different cities in King County, plus several more over the border in Pierce County, King County reported Tuesday [13 Dec 2016]. There are now 63 cases -- 12 confirmed, 51 probable -- spread across Auburn, Kent, Federal Way, Black Diamond, and Pacific.The outbreak emerged in Auburn 2 weeks ago, and the majority of cases are still located in that city. Health officials are urging the school district there to keep students who are not vaccinated against measles out of school until the outbreak subsides. However, mumps has now appeared in the Federal Way and Kent school districts, King County reported Tue [13 Dec 2016]. 44 of the 63 total cases are in children under age 17.About 67 percent of the people with mumps had received a measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccination. The MMR vaccine is 88 percent effective, but even people who have been vaccinated have a higher chance of getting the virus if they are in close, sustained contact with mumps, health officials say.Still, health officials in Pierce and King counties recommend people get an MMR vaccination to prevent further spread of the outbreak. Mumps causes flu-like symptoms, plus painful swelling of the face and neck.[Byline: Neal McNamara]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap showing the location of Washington state, United States, can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>. - Mod.LK]
