Australia Network News [edited]<http://www.australianetworknews.com/australia-meningococcal-alert-3-cases-reported/> More meningococcal cases are being reported in Australia nowadays following which the South Australian [SA] Health Ministry has requested for a new vaccine to fight the disease. SA Health confirmed 3 meningococcal cases on Tuesday [15 Nov 2016]. Two men, aged 18 and 29, were admitted to an Adelaide hospital along with a 71-year-old woman as they were diagnosed with rare W-strain. The unrelated trio is stable now but it alarmed the SA government and incited it to come up with a new B-strain vaccine and request its federal counterpart to add it to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The number of meningococcal cases was 30 in the state in 2015 while the figure is 25 for 2016 with 2 months still left in the year. One of the cases of the disease involved a 16-month-old toddler who did not survive and died in November [2016]. Though SA Health claimed that all the reported cases of meningococcal were unrelated, 17 people who have come in recent contact with the patients were requested to take in antibiotics as precaution. However, after the death of [the 16-month-old child], SA Health Minister Jack Snelling wrote a letter to his federal counterpart Sussan Ley in which he requested the government to include a new vaccine to fight meningococci. Snelling added in the letter that the vaccine was available only to people who could afford paying $500. He urged Ley in the letter sent on Tuesday to implement some measures to make the vaccine reach every section of the society."" As we've seen a drastic reduction in the number of infections in meningococcal C, we've seen meningococcal B increasingly taking its place, and one baby tragically dying from this disease,"" the letter read. Like meningococcal C, which is available for free to children, meningococcal B vaccine should also be available to every single child, irrespective of the economic and social environment they live in,"" The Advertiser quoted the words from the letter. [Byline: Susmita Pathak]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although there are at least 13 _ Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B outer membrane vesicle protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.Immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide the vaccine contains in regard to the A, C, Y, and W polysaccharide vaccines or the surface proteins in regard to serogroup B vaccine, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal groups. Following the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular meningococcal serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W ST-11 as a cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx>).Perhaps, replacement of serogroup C as a cause of IMD by serogroups W and B is what is now happening in Australia, where vaccination for meningococcal C is given at 12 months of age in combination with the _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b conjugate vaccine as part of the free National Immunisation Program (<http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/nips>). Meningococcal serogroup B vaccine is available for infants, children over 12 months, teenagers and adults and meningococcal C conjugate vaccine is available for teenagers and adults in Australia, but these vaccines are not yet subsidized by the government. South Australia (SA) is a state in south-central Australia. Its population of 1.7 million people is the most highly concentrated, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs; other population centers in the state are relatively small (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/286>.]
