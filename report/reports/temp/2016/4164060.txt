Among those confirmed ill, 3 are in [the capital] Kinshasa, 18 in central Congo.Dr. Benoit Kebela Ilunga, head of the fight against epidemiological diseases in the Ministry of Health, states that ""all are sick Congolese from Angola and returned home for treatment. There are no indigenous cases."" No one has yet contracted the disease on Congolese territory. [photo]  Besides the strengthening of surveillance on the border with Angola and inside the country, the Congolese health services have launched an awareness campaign to encourage people to use [insecticide] treated mosquito nets to avoid the bites of yellow fever mosquitoes. A support system for people is also organized.People are also asked to avoid actions, however small they may be, which could facilitate the proliferation of mosquitoes. ""The mosquito develops even in the smallest puddle. We must therefore cover water buckets kept in homes [with properly fitted lids because the mosquito  acn enter the smallest crack. - Mod.JW] so that mosquitoes do not proliferate,"" warns Dr. Kebele Ilunga However, despite all these precautions, ""the risk of an epidemic of yellow fever developing is not totally excluded.""This fear is shared; WHO considers that due to the high number of people moving between DRC and Angola, a high proportion of people susceptible to infection and the presence of the type of mosquito which transmits yellow fever, there is a ""serious risk"" for the disease to spread further.[Angola spent weeks to react after it first detected its first 4 cases in Luanda last year, and look where they are now -- almost 2000 cases and over 230 deaths reported (in reality, probably very many more) .  Because the mosquito is a day-biter, bednets do not protect anyone except people caring for a bedridden patient at home or in the hospital.   WHO should give emergency authorization to use a still effective low-dose (1/10th) of the vaccine to stretch whatever can be shipped today -- see Monath TP, Woodall JP, Gubler DJ, Yuill TM, Mackenzie JS, Martins RM, Reiter P, Heymann DL  Yellow fever vaccine: a possible solution <www.thelancet.com> v387:1599,16 Apr 2016.  KInshasa should also start ramping up mosquito control in the capital by every means as soon as possible.They need to begin vaccinating Kinshasa NOW! -- Mod.JWA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>.]
