A female patient in her 30s was diagnosed with the rare dengue virus strain following her return from Southeast Asia to Brisbane, Australia in April 2015. Similar to the 1st published case from 2014 [1,2], the 2nd patient was performing research in the jungle and developed symptoms of fever, headache, anorexia and myalgia. Whilst a highly divergent dengue virus type 1 strain was responsible for the 1st case in 2014, nucleotide sequencing analysis indicates the dengue virus strain responsible for the case in 2015 is unrelated to the 2014 DENV [dengue virus] variant and is only distantly related to known dengue endemic or sylvatic serotype 2 sequences.1.

ProMED archive number: 20140910.2762015.--Dr. Alyssa PykePublic and Environmental Health - VirologyForensic & Scientific Services, Health Support QueenslandDepartment of Health, Queensland GovernmentAustralia<Alyssa.Pyke@health.qld.gov.au>[ProMED wishes to thank Dr. Alyssa Pyke for her contribution on the 2nd reported case of sylvatic dengue caused by DENV type 2 variant virus.The 4 dengue virus (DENV) serotypes that circulate among humans emerged independently from ancestral sylvatic progenitors that were present in non-human primates, following the establishment of human populations that were large and dense enough to support continuous inter-human transmission by mosquitoes. This ancestral sylvatic-DENV transmission cycle still exists and is maintained in non-human primates and Aedes mosquitoes in the forests of Southeast Asia and West Africa [1].Previously, no evidence has shown that sylvatic DENV cycles are involved in outbreaks of human dengue, which involve the genetically and ecologically distinct endemic strains. Available data suggest that sylvatic strains are either confined to forest habitats or produce relatively mild illness, as described in a few documented human sylvatic DENV-2 infections in West Africa [2,3]. Additionally, the small number of documented human infections suggests that sylvatic DENV-2 strains do not produce secondary human infections (spillover epidemics). One possible explanation for confinement of sylvatic DENV strains to the forest is that they do not have contact with the peridomestic vectors _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_, which are not abundant in enzootic regions.The above report reinforces that sylvatic DENV viruses pose risk to human health as indicated by various documented cases of sylvatic DENV-2 infection resulting in clinical illness indistinguishable from classic dengue fever [4,5]. There was report of a severe dengue case caused by a sylvatic strain type 2 from southeast Asia [6], which further underscores the potential of sylvatic strains to cause hemorrhagic manifestations in humans, a finding further consolidated by Dr. Pyke's recent findings from Australia.References:1. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3321645/>2.
