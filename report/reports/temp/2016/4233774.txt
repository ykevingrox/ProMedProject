The Sydney Morning Herald [edited]<http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/health-authorities-quickly-and-quietly-respond-to-new-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-burwood-20160517-gowzo6.html>Expert in environmental microbiology Dr Harriet Whiley, explains the symptoms and causes of legionnaires' disease after an outbreak in Sydney [New South Wales (NSW), Australia].Health authorities are scrambling to contain the most fertile [legionellosis] season in recent history after a man died in a fresh outbreak of legionnaires' disease.The death -- the 2nd in 2 months -- is associated with an outbreak in Burwood, which has emerged as a new epicentre of infection. Burwood Council is checking all cooling towers within a 250 metre radius of Burwood Plaza for the presence of _Legionella_ after 3 cases of legionnaires' disease were confirmed in the past week. NSW Health confirmed to Fairfax Media that it was notified about the patients on Tuesday [17 May 2016], Monday [16 May 2016], and [6 May 2016].""Within the 250 metre radius there are 13 sites with cooling towers,"" a NSW Health spokeswoman said. ""9 of these towers were tested yesterday [16 May 2016], and the 4 remaining towers are being tested today [17 May 2016]. Following the confirmation today of a 3rd case, the area of investigation will be expanded on 18 May 2016.""Legionnaires' disease is a life-threatening form of pneumonia caused by the bacteria _Legionella_, which can multiply in the water supply of the air-conditioning units used to cool large buildings. Passers-by then inhale the contaminated vapours floating in the air outside.Last [Fri 13 May 2016], NSW Health ordered all water service treatment providers to send in all documents related to cooling towers that had been serviced or inspected in the Sydney CBD [central business district] since November last year [2015]. These could include service reports, cleaning reports, microbiological analysis reports, and any information related to visual checks of the water quality, such as the presence of scum, algae, biofilm, or the colour of the water. Meanwhile, City of Sydney issued a directive to building owners last [Thu 12 May 2016] to clean their cooling systems before next [Mon 23 May 2016] or the city's officers would inspect and sample the towers and charge a fee. Cooling towers do not generally need to be cleaned more often than every 6 months in NSW.More than 50 people have contracted legionnaires' disease this year [2016], with more cases notified between January to April than any year since 2012.In the week following Anzac Day [25 April. Anzac Day is the day of remembrance of those Australian and New Zealand Army Corps soldiers who fought and died at Gallipoli in 1915], 5 people were hospitalised after they were exposed to the bacteria in the blocks bounded by Kent, King, Margaret, and George streets of Sydney, and _Legionella_ was identified in 5 cooling towers. A spokeswoman for NSW Health said additional tests were being performed on 4 cooling towers.""NSW Health and the City of Sydney have taken action on all cooling towers that tested positive for _Legionella_ in the investigation area,"" the spokeswoman said. ""This includes issuing a prohibition notice, an improvement notice and warning letters requiring cleaning and disinfection.""Since Anzac Day, 1 person has contracted the disease overseas, 1 in Bankstown, and 2 in the Hunter region. 1 person has died. 9 people were hospitalised and 1 man died after an earlier outbreak in the CBD in early March [2016] and 3 people were infected in Kogarah in late March [2016].NSW Health has appointed a [legionellosis] working group, which is reviewing the recent outbreaks and considering whether new prevention measures need to be introduced. Labor Health spokesman Walt Secord has called for a taskforce to be established with experts in communicable disease, climate experts, and local government to ensure everything was being done to improve community safety.The disease most often affects older people, smokers, and those with chronic lung disease.[Byline: Harriet Alexander]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[For discussions of legionnaires' disease, please see my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below.Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/296>.
