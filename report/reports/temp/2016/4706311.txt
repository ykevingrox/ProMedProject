The child is affected by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C, the same that has been circulating in Tuscany since 2015, when it caused 31 cases of meningitis or sepsis; the present case is the 29th case in 2016.The child is in critical condition. This case is particularly worrying because the child had been vaccinated, as were 12 others of the 60 in the current outbreak, which is occurring in a limited part of Tuscany, where a massive vaccination campaign has been launched.Contacts of the case are being traced and treated according to protocols. So far, there has been no secondary case, and the organism seems to be circulating among healthy carriers.--Pasquale UrbanoFormerly: Dept. of Public HealthUniversity of FlorenceFlorence, Italy<pasquale.urbano@unifi.it>[ProMED-mail thanks Prof. Urbano for his contributions on this persistent outbreak of meningococcal serogroup C in Tuscany, Italy.The following is extracted from my comments in a prior ProMED-mail post, Meningitis, meningococcal - Italy (05): (TC) fatal, sg C, more cases 20161024.4582016:Meningococcal conjugate vaccines (in which bacterial polysaccharide is conjugated to a protein carrier) have several advantages over polysaccharide vaccines, including the ability to induce greater antibody persistence, avidity, immunologic memory, reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci, and herd immunity, but protection induced by meningococcal vaccines is strictly serotype-specific. Meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccine was introduced in the Tuscany regional immunization schedule in 2005, with 3 doses to all children at 3, 5, and 13 months of age, and at the national level, MCC was introduced in 2012.The effectiveness of MCC vaccination given in infancy has been found to wane in UK studies after one year, but the numbers of cases of serogroup C disease in the population remained low (2,3) as a consequence of a reduction in the prevalence of serogroup C nasopharyngeal carriage after vaccination leading to high levels of herd protection (4). If herd protection wanes, many children may become vulnerable to infection (5). However, cohorts vaccinated at older ages seem to have greater and longer-lasting protection than those routinely vaccinated in infancy in the UK study. Prompted by the serogroup C outbreak, health officials promoted an MCC vaccination campaign in 2015 in adolescents and adults in the area where serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ disease was reported 2015, which was extended to the whole Tuscany Region and to the elderly in 2016.1.
