The hospital closed its NICU this week for the 2nd time in a few months due to an outbreak of the _Pseudomonas_ bacteria that has sickened at least 1 infant and led to the transfer of 4 others to area medical centers.""While there is a likelihood, it remains unclear whether _Pseudomonas_ can be conclusively linked"" to the infant deaths, said Colleen Hughes Driscoll, a neonatologist with the University of Maryland Medical System. ""Is it possible? Yes. Can we say for sure? Unfortunately, no. We may never know conclusively.""The announcement marks the 1st time since the summer that the hospital has provided a specific update about the extent and impact of the outbreak.After extensive efforts to kill the waterborne germ, it continues to pose a threat. Dimensions requested assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] this week to help identify the source of the latest outbreak.Epidemiology, pediatric and infection control experts began their investigation at the Cheverly, Maryland, facility Friday [4 Nov 2016] after hospital officials announced the bacteria's recurrence in 2 infant patients who had tested positive for _Pseudomonas_.""We are puzzled, frustrated and concerned,"" said Sherry Perkins, Dimensions' chief operating officer.The NICU -- the only such facility in Prince George's County -- will remain closed until CDC officials finish their investigation and, along with state officials, give the hospital approval to reopen. But Perkins said she does not know when that will happen.Driscoll said that the children exposed to the bacteria were all premature, having been born after 23 to 26 weeks of gestation. Most of them weighed between less than 1 pound and 2.5 pounds, and suffered from different complications.The bacteria 1st appeared in late July [2016] after nasal swabs from some of the hospital's newborns tested positive. Hospital officials transferred 9 babies to Children's National Medical Center in Washington [DC] and closed the NICU for 2 months while they worked to eradicate the germ.Experts said the source of the bacteria was the NICU plumbing system, where they discovered biofilm containing the bacteria. The hospital removed sinks, treated the system and implemented routine water testing and chlorination throughout the system. Nurses now explicitly test for _Pseudomonas_ when they take nasal and perianal swabs, officials said.The NICU had been reopened only a few weeks when, on 27 Oct [2016], cultures again showed 2 babies had the bacteria in their systems. One child was suffering from the infection while the other patient is not showing symptoms, officials said.Epidemiologists assumed that pseudomonas, which is difficult to eradicate, was back in the water, but their samples came back negative, Perkins said. As of Thursday [3 Nov 2016], she said, hospital officials had no idea where the bacteria is coming from.""We thought we knew the cause but now we are not sure,"" Perkins said.[Byline: Arelis R. HernÌÁndez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report describes a recurrent outbreak of _Pseudomonas_ infection and colonization in premature newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a hospital in a Washington DC suburb. The source was initially thought to be the NICU plumbing system, but after remediation, the outbreak has recurred despite negative water cultures. However, we are not told the species of _Pseudomonas_ involved; presumably it is _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_; and we are not told if genotyping was done. We would assume a common source outbreak, if the genotype of all the clinical isolates were the same. We are also not told if the genotype of the clinical isolates matched the water isolates, which would have implicated the plumbing system as the source. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources._Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, a Gram-negative bacterium commonly occurring in soil and water, is an opportunistic pathogen and an important cause of healthcare-associated infections, especially in premature infants in NICUs. The clinical syndromes that have been described in affected infants include conjunctivitis and endophthalmitis, skin infections, bloodstream infections, meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200009073431004#t=article>).Water is a common source for nosocomial outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ infection and the formation of biofilms on environmental surfaces is well known to cause difficulties in their eradication. However, in some outbreaks, colonized healthcare workers (HCWs) transmitted _P. aeruginosa_ to patients and strict adherence to hand disinfection policies were frequently effective in controlling outbreaks (<http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-9-70>). One study found that long or artificial fingernails were a risk factor for colonization of hands of HCWs (<https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/a-prolonged-outbreak-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-in-a-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-did-staff-fingernails-play-a-role-in-disease-transmission/09EB9EA662C4482FD97975380E2E0E12>).Prince George's County, with a population of 863 420, is in the U.S. state of Maryland, bordering the eastern portion of Washington DC (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George%27s_County,_Maryland>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/223>.]
