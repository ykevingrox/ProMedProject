According to Yue, ""The donation we are making today is a concrete gesture of the China-Liberia security cooperation."" Ambassador Yue said considering the security risks in West Africa and the draw-down of UNMIL [United Nations Mission in Liberia], China will continually provide assistance to the peace-building process. This batch of donations includes around 150 units of instruments and equipment for transportation, engineering, logistics and medical treatments. Yue also said all the equipment, which belonged to the Chinese Peacekeeper Contingents, will be transferred to Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of National Defense, National Police, Bureau of Immigration, National Fire Service, JFK Hospital, Jackson Fiah Doe Memorial Hospital and other departments and organizations of Liberia. According to Ambassador Yue, Chinese peacekeeping contingents will donate all their campuses, barracks and the nonmilitary facilities to Liberia.

Pregnant girls, exploited after the Ebola crisis, remain banned from Sierra Leone schools<http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/06/21/pregnant-girls-exploited-after-the-ebola-crisis-remain-banned-from-sierra-leone-schools/>A ban on girls who became pregnant during the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] crisis in Sierra Leone attending high school has only been partially lifted, according to advocacy campaign Equality Now. Although 5000 students who were expelled for getting pregnant have been allowed to return to the education system, the group is drawing attention to discrimination against victims of sexual assault, who remain excluded. At the height of the [EVD] outbreak, sexual exploitation increased dramatically. Orphaned girls turned to prostitution in order to afford the basics, while others were simply unprotected from predators, with a subsequent spike in teen pregnancies. When schools re-opened in April 2015, the pregnant girls were not permitted to attend, amid fears of a ""negative influence.""[This is a very unfortunate byproduct of the Ebola outbreak. The pregnant girls need all the support they can get financially, emotionally, and educationally. - Mod.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30081-XSummary.""Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the world. Before the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, according to the Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey of 2013, FGM had been performed on 89.6 percent of girls and women. FGM of any type has been recognized as a harmful practice and a fundamental violation of human rights, the rights to the highest attainable standard of health and bodily integrity, among others. During the EVD outbreak, a plethora of actors--among them both Paramount Chiefs (traditional heads of Chiefdoms who serve to protect the customs and traditions of their people) and some Councils of Soweis--enacted laws and pledges to postpone FGM in order to reduce the risk of EVD transmission. Penalties varied from fines up to 500Ûö000 Leones (about USD110) to public flogging.""...[more][Globally, over 4 M girls per year undergo some form of FGM, according to the UN. This can range from symbolic ritual to grotesque deformation. Ebola is not the least of reasons this must be stopped, or altered more towards a symbolic gesture. Eradication of this barbaric procedure has been attempted for 30 years, yet it remains a problem in a number of countries throughout the world. - Mod.

Fabipiravir (brand name Avigan), a Japanese-developed anti-influenza drug, is potential treatment to fight Ebola virus disease. The report from Fujifilm stated that Ebola and influenza viruses are the same general type, thus a similar response to the antiviral could theoretically be expected from Ebola.However, influenza and Ebola are very different viruses. Although both viruses are in the order Mononegavirales, and as such contain negative sense single-stranded RNA, they are in different families. Ebola virus Zaire is one of 5 viruses in the Ebolavirus genus, family Filoviridae. Influenza, on the other hand, is in the Family Orthomyxovirus. The drug inhibits viral replication within infected cells to prevent propagation, but the 2 viruses have very different strategies of replication. The influenza virion is segmented, containing 8 segments of viral RNA. Ebolavirus genome is approximately 19 000 nt [nucleotide(s)] long. The drug has not been proven to be effective against Ebola. - Mod.LK]******[5] Funding16 Jun 2016 <http://awoko.org/2016/06/20/sierra-leone-news-airtel-presents-le234-5m-to-50-ebola-orphans/>Sierra Leone: Airtel presents Le234.5m to 50 ebola orphans[In honoring the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) signed last year, Airtel last Thursday [16 Jun 2016], presented a check of Sierra Leonian Leone 234.5 million (USD 50 thousand) to the orphanage and also gave the orphans a treat of grandeur at the company's Hill Station head office.

Jun 2016. Global Health Research and Policy. 2016; 1(5): DOI: 10.1186/s41256-016-0005-8Methods.An analysis of suspected, probable, or confirmed cases of EVD (nÛäequalÛä607) reported to the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) between 23 Mar 2014 and 31 Dec 2014 was conducted. The likelihood of infection given exposure factors was determined using logistic regression in individuals with a definitive diagnosis by RT-PCR (nÛä equal Ûä321). The risk of short-term mortality (30 days) given demographic factors, clinical symptoms, and highest level of treatment received was assessed with Cox regression and survival analyses (nÛä equal Ûä391).Results.The overall mortality rate was 53.5 percent (95 percent CI: 49 percent, 58 percent) and decreased as access to medical treatment increased. Those who reported contact with another EVD case were more likely to be infected (OR: 5.7), as were those who attended a funeral (OR: 3.9). Mortality increased with age (P Ûäless than 0.001) and was higher in males compared to females (P equal 0.006). Fever (HR: 6.63), vomiting (HR: 1.93), diarrhea (HR: 1.99), and unexplained bleeding (HR: 2.17) were associated with increased mortality. After adjusting for age, hospitalized patients had a 74 percent reduction in the risk of short term mortality (PÛäless thanÛä0.001 AHR: 0.26; 95 percent CI AHR: 0.18, 0.37), compared to those not given medical intervention.Conclusion.Even treatment with only basic supportive care such as intravenous rehydration therapy was able to significantly improve patient survival in suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases.23 Jun 2016<http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00142/abstract>Decroo T: Psychological distress among Ebola survivors discharged from an Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia, Liberia - a qualitative study. Front. Public Health. 2016; 4(142): doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2016.00142.Results.The main stressors inside the ETU [Ebola treatment unit] were the daily exposure to corpses, which often remained several hours among the living; the patients' isolation from their families and worries about their well being; and sometimes the perception of disrespect by ETU staff. However, most survivors reported how staff motivated patients to drink, eat, bathe, and walk. Additionally, employing survivors as staff fostered hope, calling patients by their name increased confidence and familiarity, and organizing prayer and singing activities brought comfort. When EVD [Ebola virus disease] survivors returned home, the experience of being alive was both a gift and a burden. Flashbacks were common among survivors. Perceived as contagious, many were excluded from their family, professional and social life. Some survivors faced divorce, were driven out of their houses or lost their jobs. The subsequent isolation prevented survivors from picking up daily life, and the multiple losses affected their coping mechanisms. However, when available, the support of family, friends and prayer enabled survivors to cope with their mental distress. For those excluded from society, psycho-social counseling and the survivor's network were ways to give a meaning to life post-EVD.Conclusion.Exposure to death in the ETU and stigma in the communities induced post-traumatic stress reactions and symptoms of depression among Ebola survivors. Distress in the ETU can be reduced through timely management of corpses. Coping mechanisms can be strengthened through trust relationships, religion, peer/community support, and community-based psychosocial care. Mental health disorders need to be addressed with appropriate specialized care and follow-up.June 2016 <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/8/16-0205_article>Ratnayake R, Crowe SJ, Jasperse J, et al.: Assessment of community event-based surveillance for Ebola virus disease, Sierra Leone, 2015. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016; 22(8): DOI: 10.3201/eid2208.160205.Abstract. (ahead of print)In 2015, community event-based surveillance (CEBS) was implemented in Sierra Leone to assist with the detection of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases. We assessed the sensitivity of CEBS for finding EVD cases during a 7-month period, and in a 6-week subanalysis, we assessed the timeliness of reporting cases with no known epidemiologic links at time of detection. Of the 12 126 CEBS reports, 287 (2 percent) met the suspected case definition, and 16 were confirmed positive. CEBS detected 30 percent (16/53) of the EVD cases identified during the study period. During the subanalysis, CEBS staff identified 4 of 6 cases with no epidemiologic links. These CEBS-detected cases were identified more rapidly than those detected by the national surveillance system; however, too few cases were detected to determine system timeliness. Although CEBS detected EVD cases, it largely generated false alerts. Future versions of community-based surveillance could improve case detection through increased staff training and community engagement.******[7] Nongovernment organization23 Jun 2016 <http://www.news-medical.net/news/20160623/Johns-Hopkins-students-improve-protective-suit-design-to-help-Ebola-health-workers.aspx>Johns Hopkins students improve protective suit design to help Ebola health workers.2 Johns Hopkins mechanical engineering undergraduate teams, sponsored by the Johns Hopkins Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design (CBID) have developed prototypes for a more comfortable hood and face mask making breathing easier, and for a battery-powered system that decreases humidity in the suit. DuPont has a license to manufacture a coverall, hood and full body suit designed and prototyped by CBID last year. The products reduce the number of pieces required by current protocols, take much less time to put on and remove, and cut the number of potential contamination exposure points by nearly a third. The 2 recent projects by seniors at the Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering are meant to improve the CBID designs even further. According to Laura Scavo, who graduated in May 2016 with a degree in mechanical engineering and worked on the hood as a final project, ""The hope for us is this could be used for any infectious disease that's transmitted through bodily fluids."" Under a grant, she is continuing to work with the CBID team this summer.In their final report, students wrote ""The aim of our device is to extend the working time of health care workers in an Ebola treatment unit by increasing thermal comfort and, thus, decreasing the risk of heat-induced psychological and physiological impairments.""[A highly needed improvement if it proves effective in the field. - Mod.LK][Compiled by Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>For maps go to:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>. - Mod.LK][See Also:Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.3908196].................................................lk/ao/lm"
