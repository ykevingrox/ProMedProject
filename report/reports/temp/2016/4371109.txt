Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hong-kong-reports-vibrio-vulnificus-caused-necrotizing-fasciitis-contracted-by-cut-from-fish-fin-45487/>Hong Kong health officials report on a case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_ affecting a 59-year-old woman with underlying illnesses recorded 5 Jul 2016. She presented with left leg pain, redness and fever on 3 Jul 2016 and was admitted to a public hospital on the same day.Surgical debridement of the wound was performed on the same day and the operative diagnosis was necrotizing fasciitis. She required postoperative intensive care. Her wound swab collected on 3 Jul [2016] yielded _Vibrio vulnificus_. She was treated with antimicrobials and her condition stabilized. She was transferred back to general ward on 6 Jul 2016.She had handled raw fish during food preparation and her left leg was injured by fish fins on 2 Jul 2016. Her home contact was asymptomatic.Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, _V. vulnificus_ infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease. The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[What risk factors, if any, the afflicted woman had is unstated.The following is excerpted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070473.htm>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.""""The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions"" (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.]
