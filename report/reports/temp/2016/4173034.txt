Australian Broadcasting Corporation [edited]<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-20/salmonella-outbreak-in-darwin/7341566>An investigation into more than 50 cases of salmonellosis in Darwin and the surrounding area is currently under way, the Department of Health has confirmed. Salmonella infection is often caused by ingesting food contaminated with the bacterium.Dr Peter Markey, head of surveillance at the Centre for Disease Control, said it was too early to say where the outbreak started or how it spread. He said the investigation was attempting to determine whether there had been a common food source at the root of the outbreak, and confirmed workers at the INPEX [oil company. - Mod.SH] workers' camp in Darwin's rural area had been affected. ""It's across a lot of areas. There's been cases at INPEX of course, but there have been cases in other places in Darwin and so across the board really,"" Dr Markey said. ""We are interviewing all the cases and trying to find out the source.""Dr Markey said there were usually between 4 and 8 cases of salmonellosis each week in the Darwin urban region, and more than 50 was cause for investigation. ""Given the number of cases we've been alerted to, understandably, we are very keen to quickly identify the source of the problem,"" Dr Markey said.The Department of Health said while raw [or undercooked - Mod.LL] food was a common cause of salmonellosis, environmental factors including geckos, frogs and family pets could also be a possible source. But Dr Markey said contaminated food was the more likely culprit. ""This type of salmonella has also been increasing in other states, and so this cluster may be linked to a national increase,"" he said. ""But our investigation will continue to assess all possible sources both inside and outside the territory.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The vehicle and scope in this outbreak in Australia's Northern Territory has yet to be reported.
