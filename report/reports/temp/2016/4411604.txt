The health department has confirmed 96 cases of [scrub] typhus in the state this year [2016], a senior health officer confirmed.The state communicable disease surveillance officer of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) Mr Rakesh Roshan Bhardwaj said that around 1072 blood samples were taken in 2 medical colleges at IGMC Shimla and Dr RPMC Tanda and other hospitals this year [2016], in which 96 patients were found positive for [scrub] typhus. He said that 14 cases were tested positive at IGMC, and 2 lives were lost due to [scrub] typhus this year [2016]. He said that the 2 persons were from Shimla and Kullu districts.Dr Bhardwaj said that IDSP has launched a statewide awareness campaign, as cases of the seasonal viral [sic] fever disease were pouring in from all the districts, with most of the cases from Shimla district [Scrub typhus is actually not due to a virus, but a rickettsia-like bacterium, _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. - Mod.ML]. He said that most victims hailed from rural areas and could not be diagnosed on time, and most of the deaths occurred due to late admission to the hospital.A heath study found that [scrub] typhus is an endemic disease [that] is caused from the bite of a mite, [which] infests grass and weeds during monsoon season. [Scrub typhus is due to the bite of the larval form (a chigger) of a trombiculid mite infected with _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, which feeds on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents]. The mite carries [scrub] typhus strains from rodents found in the grass, and if it enters in the human body, it may prove fatal if not diagnosed or tested clinically as soon as possible.The disease is taking a heavy toll on women in the state, as they collect green foliage for cattle, and in some cases, men and women while working in the farms and fields may come into contact with the mites. After a bite, it leaves ""cigarette burn marks"" [characteristic black eschars at the sites of the chigger bites] on the body, Dr R R Bhardwaj warned. He said that most of the patients turn up in the hospital with symptoms of fever without cough, stiff joints, and body-aches. It can lead to death in many cases if diagnosis get delayed, however in most of the cases, patient recover within a week after normal treatment, free in all state hospitals.To prevent loss of life due to [scrub] typhus, the IDSP unit has advised all medical officers to prescribe a dose of antibiotics even before confirmation, as doxycycline is highly effective and, soon after the treatment, fever gradually comes down.To control the disease among the masses, IDSP has launched a statewide drive, and teachers in the villages are being advised to educate students on the need for prompt treatment if anyone complains of symptoms of this mysterious fever. He said that the state government launched the drive because it was taking 15 to 20 lives each year.[byline: M L Verma]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state in North India, bordered by Jammu and Kashmir on the north, Punjab on the west, Haryana on the southwest, Uttarakhand on the southeast and by the Tibet Autonomous Region on the east (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh>).For discussions of scrub typhus, see moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.]
