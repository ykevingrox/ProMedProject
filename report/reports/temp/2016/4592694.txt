The Register-Guard [edited]<http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/34930609-75/rates-of-sexually-transmitted-syphilis-spreading-in-lane-county.html.csp>Syphilis, a dangerous sexually transmitted disease, is spreading at a troubling rate in Lane County, health officials said Thursday [27 Oct 2016]. The number of reported syphilis cases in Lane County spiked from 2014 to 2015. An even higher total is expected in 2016, prompting public health officials to make broader education efforts.The number of cases more than doubled from 21 in 2014 to 59 in 2015, said Jason Davis, spokesman for Lane County Public Health. This year [2016], 41 cases have been reported through 6 Oct 2016, putting the county on pace to exceed last year's figure, he said. Most of the cases were in the Eugene-Springfield area, but ""we're also seeing cases in Florence and Cottage Grove,"" Davis said.Of the 41 cases, 23 were men and 18 were women, and most of the patients were 20 to 29 years old, Davis said.This trend is troubling, Lane County Health Officer Dr. Patrick Luedtke said. ""Up until 2012, we could expect a small, easily trackable number of cases that were confined primarily to men who have sex with men, but what this information shows is that our new average is in the double digits and spread nearly equally between men and women,"" he said. ""This creates the potential for the disease to increase its footprint within our communities and infect more people at an ever increasing rate.""The main reason the disease is spreading is unprotected sex; people are having vaginal, oral or anal sex without using a condom, Lane County Public Health officials said.In Lane County, 62 percent of men who have sex with men aren't practicing safe sex, Davis said.""Because so many STDs are manageable and curable, people have a lax attitude toward safe sex,"" he said. Lack of access to medical services, such as testing, and inadequate communication between health care providers and patients about the patient's sexual history also are factors, public health officials said.Syphilis can have dire health consequences if left untreated. Syphilis, a bacterial infection, generally progresses through 3 stages, according to the Oregon Health Authority. It 1st shows itself as a painless sore on the penis, vagina, anus, or inside the mouth or rectum within a few weeks after infection. While the sore is healing, or several weeks after it has healed, a non-itchy rash may affect all or part of the body. Often red or brownish-red spots appear on the patient's palms and soles. In the 3rd stage of the disease, patients might not have any symptoms, increasing the risk of them spreading it to others, public health officials said.Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to difficulty coordinating muscle movements, paralysis, numbness, blindness, dementia, damage to internal organs, and death.Lane County Public Health is launching an informational campaign to increase public awareness about syphilis. It will align its education efforts with other community health providers, such as HIV Alliance and Planned Parenthood, Davis said. Through public service announcements and ads, Lane County Public Health will direct people to the website syphaware.org, which was developed by the Oregon Health Authority. The website lays out information about how to prevent, identify and get treatment for syphilis.Chief Health Officer Dr. Patrick Luedtke will have conversations with area health care providers about how to talk with patients about their sexual history, how to recognize symptoms of syphilis, and how to report these cases, Davis said.Cases of syphilis in Lane County are on the rise: 2010 - 2 cases; 2011 - 1 case; 2012 - 8 cases; 2013 - 20 cases; 2014 - 21 cases; 2015 - 59 cases; and 2016 - 41 [cases so far].[Byline: Sherri Buri McDonald]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Lane County, with a population of 351 715 residents, is located in the U.S. state of Oregon and extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Cascade mountain range of western North America (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_County,_Oregon>).
