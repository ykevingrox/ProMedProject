Africanews [edited]<http://www.africanews.com/2016/05/30/mass-yellow-fever-vaccination-kicks-off-in-drc/>A mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever has kicked off in the Democratic Republic of Congo, following an outbreak of the disease in the country.The immunization aims to cover about 2 million people in the zones lying at the border with neighbouring Angola. It will however exclude pregnant women and children below 9 months.The campaign, financed by Gavi-Alliance comes after 48 cases were confirmed in the country including 44 cases imported from Angola. 7 people in the Congo Central region have lost their lives as reported by different hospitals in the province.According to the World Health Organisation, more than 300 people have died in Angola in just 4 months, following the outbreak of the disease detected at the end of last year [2015].The disease has already spread to Kenya and China and there is an unrelated outbreak in Uganda, generating fears of the mosquito-borne disease jumping to sprawling cities in Asia and Africa.There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and found in tropical regions of Africa and Latin America's Amazon region.[Byline: Linnete Bahati]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[One hopes that the campaign along the border with Angola is just the start of a more extensive effort. It is clear that infected people, some doubtless viremic, have been coming into the DR Congo from Angola, where the yellow fever (YF) outbreak continues. However, of equal or greater concern is the occurrence of locally acquired cases, especially in the large city and province of Kinshasa with its 12.9 million inhabitants. The inadequate YF vaccination coverage (under 80 percent) reported previously (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160502.4197790) and high _Aedes aegypti_ household infestation rates present a situation of risk for occurrence of a significant YF outbreak. Although the availability of the 2 million doses is good news, the overall situation, in turn, raises the question about adequate vaccine availability now and in the immediate future, should an outbreak begin.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the Congo DR can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>. - Mod.TY]
