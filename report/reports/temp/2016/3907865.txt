ABC Ciudad Real Spain [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]<http://www.abc.es/espana/castilla-la-mancha/abci-confirmado-fuente-ornamental-foco-legionela-201512301431_noticia.html>The initial results from the genetic sequencing laboratory of the Mixed Unit of Infection and Public Health, University of Valencia confirmed the positivity of the ornamental fountain at the Manzanares bus station, from which at least 2 strains of _Legionella_ were identified, which, in principle, could be related to strains isolated from patients; all are awaiting further tests being carried out in that laboratory.Furthermore, this report also confirms that the cooling tower in the private sector of the industrial estate is contaminated with _Legionella_, though, so far, it is not related to the strains of patients with which it has been compared.This confirms the microbiological results obtained by the Public Health Laboratory of Talavera de la Reina and also agrees with epidemiological analyses conducted by the Directorate General of Public Health of the Ministry of Health.Since last December 14 [2015], by order of the Ministry of Health, these facilities, and all those which were identified a potential risk, have been closed. None of these facilities will open until there is proven evidence to the fullest extent that they present the least possible risk to the population. To do this, the Directorate General of Public Health will perform continuous analysis.Moreover, according to data provided by the Epidemiology Service of the Ministry, no new case has appeared since 25 Dec 2015.The total number of confirmed cases [in the Manzanares outbreak of Legionnaires' disease] is to date 228, 23 of whom remain hospitalized; 4 are in intensive care units, 3 of them in the ICU of the Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real and 1 in the Hospital La Mancha Centro Alcazar de San Juan.--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[At the time of the 1st report of this outbreak on 14 Dec 2015 (ProMED-mail: Legionellosis - Spain (02): (CM) 20151217.3869362), there were only 5 cases of suspected Legionnaires' disease in the city of Manzanares. Now, over 2 weeks later, there are 228 confirmed cases, with 2 deaths. An ornamental fountain at the Manzanares bus station is the suspected source and has been closed, as have other potential sources, and the (genotype?) of strains of _Legionella_ from the fountain are apparently being tested against that of clinical isolates of _Legionella_, to confirm transmission pathways.For a discussion of Legionnaires' disease, see my moderator's comments in ProMED-mail: Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) 20130901.1916014. Manzanares, with a population of 18 924 in 2014, is a municipality in the province of Ciudad Real, the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzanares,_Ciudad_Real>).
