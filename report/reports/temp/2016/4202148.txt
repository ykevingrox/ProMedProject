The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fresh-cases-of-anthrax-reported/article8554109.ece>As many as 19 more cases of suspected cutaneous anthrax were reported from the Visakha Agency even as 12 out of the 16 Girijans [hill people] admitted during the last week have been discharged from the King George Hospital [KGH] here on [Mon 2 May 2016] and [Tue 3 May 2016].The 19 Girijans, 6 from Vennelakota and 13 from Goyyagoti villages in [Gangaraju] Madugula mandal [Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh state] were brought to KGH around 11.30pm on [Mon 2 May 2016] and treatment to them commenced immediately basing on the clinical tests, Superintendent of KGH M. Madhusudhana Babu said on [Tue 3 May 2016]. The first batch of 16 is from Panasapalli in Hukumpeta mandal [Visakhapatnam district] and was brought to KGH last [Tue 3 May 2016].Smears were collected for testing at the Department of Microbiology of Andhra Medical College and antibody test will also be done with the help of 50 kits provided by a 2-member team of scientists from DRDE [Defence Research & Development Establishment], Gwalior that examined the 1st batch of suspected anthrax patients a few days ago. Samples collected from the 1st batch of patients have been sent to DRDE for ELISA test and results are awaited. However, ""clinical tests showed that the problem was cutaneous anthrax and treatment done accordingly has showed result,"" he said. Samples of fresh batch will also be sent to Gwalior lab for ELISA test.The 19 who were admitted on [Mon 2 May 2016] night had consumed meat of a dead ox, Dr. Madhusudhana Babu has gathered while talking to them. He is suspecting one of the patients is suffering with TB also.Suspected cutaneous anthrax cases have been reported in a large number after a gap of several years. The spores of anthrax live in the atmosphere for a long time and spread to human beings when they cut and consume meat of cattle that died due to anthrax.The spores would enter the human body through the cuts and gashes on the hands of a person. However, cutaneous anthrax is not a life-threatening disease. Cattle or goats and sheep that die due to anthrax must be buried properly.[Byline: G Narasimha Rao] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[While anthrax cutaneous lesions are very distinctive -- localized inflammation, no local pain but itching, small vesicles, and eventually the development of a black ulcer -- laboratory confirmation is still awaited. The long delay would suggest that the laboratory is having problems and recycling whatever samples they may have including sera.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53030>. - Mod.MHJ]
