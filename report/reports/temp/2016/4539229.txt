It has also been accepting more patients in the terminal phase of their illnesses.Police will investigate the deaths of the patients but are unlikely to be able to specify the causes, because many of the bodies have already been cremated.""We see many people pass away due to the nature of this hospital but had the impression that the number of those dying was increasing a bit,"" a hospital official said.It was not immediately known how the figures compare with deaths in other hospitals catering to patients with similar diseases or at a similar stage of life.The hospital 1st alerted the police about the possibility that intravenous drips had been tampered with on 20 Sep 2016. The police have so far determined that 2 88-year-old male patients were poisoned to death.Investigators did not notice holes on the intravenous drip bags the 2 patients had used, but they discovered holes in the seals on the rubber plugs in about 10 of the 50 unused bags kept at a nurses' station on the 4th floor of the hospital.A nurse who works at a hospital in Tokyo told Kyodo News that expertise is needed to inject chemicals into drip bags, while an investigative source said: ""It's difficult to imagine a situation that an outsider entered the nurse station and tampered (with the drip bags).""The 2 patients died around the 3-day weekend that began on 17 Sep 2016 and when the number of hospital staff on duty was less than usual. At night, the entrance of the hospital was locked with security guards on service to prevent outsiders from entering.Surface acting agents are widely used in hospitals as disinfectants but can be poisonous to the human body and are not allowed to be administered orally.--Communicated by:Karyn Bischoff<klb72@cornell.edu>[Indeed, these deaths are suspicious. The ones early on in August and September 2016 may signal that the activity had been occurring for some time before it was noticed. This investigation may take some time, but we hope the perpetrator will be found. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.]
