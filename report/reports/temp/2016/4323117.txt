Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/chikungunya-mother-to-baby-transmission-reported-in-brazil-67026/>Brazilian officials are reporting a confirmed case of chikungunya that was transmitted from mother to baby (vertical transmission) in Paraiba state in northeast Brazil, according to a local media report.The 12-day-old baby showed strong convulsions and is now hospitalized in an intensive care unit in the city of Campina Grande.Municipal Children's Hospital obstetrician Adriana Melo said they are unaware of any similar precedent in the country, although cases have been reported in the literature. Melo's team was also responsible for identifying the Zika virus in the amniotic fluid of 2 fetuses with microcephaly in 2015.Researchers note that vertical transmission cases have been reported in an epidemic on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean during the years 2005 and 2006.This case strengthens the alert for pregnant women, who should take protective measures against _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito vector for Zika, dengue and chikungunya [viruses], throughout the period of pregnancy. ""While the increased risk of transmission of Zika occurs in the 1st 3 months of pregnancy, in the case of chikungunya is the opposite. The transmission to the fetus usually happens when the mother already [is] at the end of pregnancy,"" says Oswaldo Cruz Foundation researcher Rivaldo Cunha.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Vertical transmission, _Aedes aegypti_Date: October 2016Source: Acta Tropica 162: 46-55 doi:10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.06.004 [edited]<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X16303114>Jaspreet Jain, Raja Babu S.

Evidence for natural vertical transmission of chikungunya viruses in field populations of _Aedes aegypti_ in Delhi and Haryana states in India -- a preliminary report.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract_Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ are principal vectors for the transmission of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). India is a hub for both dengue and chikungunya infections and there are several reports of co-infection of dengue and chikungunya virus in the clinical scenario. The present pilot entomological survey was conducted to evaluate vertical transmission of CHIKV in _Aedes_ field populations. _Aedes_ immature (larvae and pupae) collection was done in 2012, over a period of 6 months from selected sites in Delhi and Haryana, India. The immatures collected were reared for adult emergence and species identification was done. _Ae. aegypti_ male and female mosquitoes were separated and pooled collection spot-wise, RNA extracted and RT PCR performed to test for the presence of CHIKV in the pools. Container index (CI) and minimum infection rate (MIR) were estimated. From study areas that tested positive for CHIKV, adult collections were made and females upon feeding on uninfected blood in laboratory were allowed to lay eggs. The progeny that emerged from these field-collected mothers were tested for CHIKV presence. Our pilot survey showed the existence of _Ae. aegypti_ populations even during peak summer season in a few foci which eventually helped the mosquitoes to tide over adverse environmental conditions and with the start of rainfall, the population exploded within a short period of time. Immatures collected from field and progeny of adults collected from the field were CHIKV positive demonstrating the presence of vertical transmission of chikungunya virus in field population of _Ae. aegypti_. The present study further demonstrates the importance of identifying permanent breeding sites for proper _Aedes_ species control.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Occurrence of transovarial transmission of CHIKV by _Ae. aegypti_ may explain, in part, persistence of the virus in certain foci in India. It will be important to determine if stabilized CHIKV infections occur in this mosquito that could lead to long-term presence of the virus in certain areas. One hopes that the pilot studies reported here will be pursued. - Mod.TY]
