Although these projects are coming to an end, MSF continues to provide healthcare to the 3 countries which were severely affected by Ebola, including Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.The [EVD] outbreak swept across West Africa, infecting more than 28 700 people and killing over 11 300 people. Families were ripped apart and communities devastated by the disease, which saw schools close, economies grind to a halt and health systems collapse. ... -more][It is worth reading the entire report to see all that MSF has done to improve health services in West Africa, from EVD to HIV, maternal care and mental health. - Mod.LK]Research------15 Nov 2016: Study finds people with Ebola may not always show symptoms<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-11-people-ebola-symptoms.html>[A year after the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine and other institutions identified 14 individuals previously unknown to have had the disease in a Sierra Leone village that was an Ebola hot spot. According to Gene Richardson, MD, a former fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford who is now a PhD candidate in anthropology at the university, these individuals had antibodies to the virus, suggesting they had been infected at one time. Yet 12 of these individuals said they had had no symptoms during the time of active transmission in the village.The research confirms previous suspicions that the Ebola virus does not uniformly cause severe disease and that people may be infected without showing signs of illness.According to Dr. Richardson, ""The study corroborates previous evidence that Ebola is like most other viruses in that it causes a spectrum of manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. It provides important evidence on that front. It also means a significant portion of transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak. This shows there was a lot more human-to-human transmission than we thought."" Based on the results of the study, the researchers calculated the prevalence of minimally symptomatic infection to be 25 percent. According to Dr. Richardson, ""This shows there was a lot more human-to-human transmission than we thought."" ...moreCitation. Richardson G., Farmer P, et al. (15 Nov 2016). Study finds people with Ebola may not always show symptoms. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005087][Submitted by: Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka][These findings, which were presented at the 65th annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, have had a lot of coverage by different sources, not surprising as it is important to recognize that the West African outbreak of Ebola virus led to asymptomatic as well as a range of symptomatic cases. It would be interesting to know whether asymptomatic individuals are infectious to others or whether contact leads to protective immunity.In this current serosurvey in Sukudu, Richardson and colleagues sampled a total of 187 individuals for [EV antibody] in 24 of 25 previously quarantined houses. 34 total symptomatic cases were identified, and 14 individuals were found who were IgG-positive by ELISA. Two of these individuals reported fever during the quarantine period, and 12 were classified as minimally symptomatic, contributing 25% to the total caseload.An earlier paper -- see below -- that also looked into the occurrence of asymptomatic infection found that:Evidence suggests that many Ebola infections are asymptomatic, a factor overlooked by recent outbreak summaries and projections. Particularly, results from one post-Ebola outbreak serosurvey showed that 71% of seropositive individuals did not have the disease; another study reported that 46% of asymptomatic close contacts of patients with Ebola were seropositive. Although asymptomatic infections are unlikely to be infectious, they might confer protective immunity and thus have important epidemiological consequences.For full correspondence and references, see Steve E Bellan et al.

The cemetery is reportedly said to be occupying over 10 000 acres.Deputy Chief Administrator (DCA) of WARDC, Peter Abdul Koroma, said the cemetery covers a vast landscape, and the council alone could not afford to fund the construction of a perimeter fence to protect it from intruders.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.ProMED-mail HealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>][See Also:Ebola update (66): news, research, funding, economy 20161115.4629793Ebola update (65): news, research, commentary, economy, funding, vaccine 20161106.4609611Ebola update (64): news, research 20161030.4595759Ebola update (63): news, research 20161023.4579436Ebola update (62): news, research, treatment, funding 20161017.4564066Ebola update (61): news, funding, economy 20161009.4547627Ebola update (60): news, research, economy 20161002.4531285Ebola update (59): news, research, funding 20160925.4514591Ebola update (58): news, research, funding, vaccine 20160918.4497393Ebola update (57): news, research, funding 20160911.4481043Ebola update (56): news, vaccine, research 20160904.4465145Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594].................................................lk/msp/dk"
