Express Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1166040/deadly-disease-congo-virus-claims-cattle-handlers-life/>Û The deadly Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, a tick-borne viral disease, has claimed another life in Karachi. This was confirmed by Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC)'s Dr Seemin Jamali on Friday [19 Aug 2016].AD, 22, son of EB, was a cattle handler and had arrived from Bahawalpur to sell cattle for Eidul Azha 25 days ago. He was staying in Karachi's Mawach Goth area. According to Dr Jamali, AD was admitted early Wednesday [17 Aug 2016] morning and died on Fri 19 Aug 2016 afternoon while under treatment. The victim had suffered a high-grade fever for 7 days with gum and nose bleeding and bruises on his hands for 2 days.According to health department official Dr Syed Zafar Mehdi, the health secretary has directed additional commissioner Aslam Khoso to isolate all animals and people that may have come in contact with the victim with the help of Malir deputy commissioner and screen them.--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs from HealthMap Alerts<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[With increased movement of cattle within the country and also across borders in some areas on account of the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha events, an alert situation has been raised by the recent increase in the number of suspected cases of CCHF, some of which have been fatal. Whether this latest case originating/traveling from Bahawalpur is a coincidental finding or there is some definitive contact history that merits epidmiological investigation, since fatal cases were reported earlier this month (August 2016), is an open question. However, the prudent approach would require getting the right kind of public health messages to health care workers, the animal farmers, handlers and butchers, as well as the general public, so that potentially exposed individuals can report to health care facilities at the earliest. Even though the mortality rate from CCHF increases once there are frank hemmorhagic manifestations (10-40%), most exposed individuals stay asymptomatic (up to 80%). Contacts of a suspected case need to be councilled on protective measures and monitoring for any appearance of fever or bleeding. It should be remembered that CCHF can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids and not through aerosols, and hence protective measures should be appropriately adopted [<http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/transmission/index.html>].Any further information on the fatal case, contact history, and epidemiological information will be highly appreciated.Documented spread of CCHF has also occurred in hospitals due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies. The health care staff must be advised on proper infection control measures and their strict adherence must be ensured by the facility administration. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.]
