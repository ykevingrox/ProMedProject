Medscape, Reuters report [edited]<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/858628?src=wnl_mdplsnews_160219_mscpedit_wir&uac=71062PY&impID=996619&faf=1>US researchers say they have discovered a new bacterial species that causes Lyme disease in humans [1,2].The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, working with the Mayo Clinic [in Rochester, Minnesota] and health officials from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota, discovered the new species, called _Borrelia mayonii_, the CDC said in a statement.Previously, only _Borrelia burgdorferi_ was believed to cause human Lyme disease, which is transmitted through bites from by the blacklegged ""deer"" tick [_Ixodes scapularis_], the CDC said._B. mayonii_ has so far only been detected in the upper Midwest region of the United States, the CDC said.Researchers discovered _B. mayonii_ after studying blood samples of patients in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota who were suspected of having Lyme disease from 2012-2014, the CDC said. Samples from 6 out of 9000 patients showed ""unusual results"" and prompted further study, the health agency said._B. mayonii_ is similar to _B. burgdorferi_ in that it initially causes fever, headache, rash, and neck pain and later arthritis associated with Lyme disease, according to the CDC. But _B. mayonii_ adds nausea, vomiting, and widespread rash, and causes a higher concentration of bacteria in the blood, the CDC said.There are an estimated 300 000 cases of Lyme disease in the US annually, according to the CDC. The disease is rarely fatal, and most patients recover after a few weeks of oral antibiotics, the agency said.The patients infected with _B. mayonii_ were treated successfully with the same antibiotics used for those with _B. burgdorferi_, the CDC said. It is too early to say whether _B. mayonii_ will be more or less dangerous than _B. burgdorferi_, said Jeannine Petersen, a CDC microbiologist. ""We have fairly limited information in that our study described 6 patients,"" she told Reuters. ""We need more patients in order to capture the full spectrum of those who might have less severe symptoms and those who might have more severe ones.""It is likely that the bacterium is a ""recently emerged"" organism since it did not appear in previous, extensive testing of blood samples of patients suspected of having Lyme disease, Peterson added.[Byline: David Beasley][References:------------1.

Human infection, called Lyme borreliosis, due to _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato may involve multiple organs or tissues, resulting in skin, cardiac, neurological, and musculoskeletal disorders. Different _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato species have been associated with distinct clinical manifestations. Multiple erythema migrans (EM) and Lyme arthritis are more common in the United States than in Europe, whereas neuroborreliosis [or Lyme affecting the nervous system], borrelial lymphocytoma [bluish-red nodular swelling], and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans [condition affecting distal parts of the limbs; the most common manifestation of the late stage of Lyme disease] have more frequently occurred in European patients. In addition, _Borrelia_ species are differentially distributed worldwide. In Europe, most commonly _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto, _B. garinii_, and _B. afzelii_ cause Lyme borreliosis in humans; whereas, in the North America, only _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto was known to cause Lyme borreliosis.The news report above describes the finding of a new _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies (candidatus _B. mayonii_) in 6 (5 blood, 1 synovial fluid) of 100Ûö545 clinical specimens that were submitted by physicians for routine PCR from 1 Jan 2003 to 30 Sep 2014 in the upper Midwestern USA. This organism was also detected in _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks collected at probable patient exposure sites, but was not detected in clinical specimens before 2012.Genetic differences between species within the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex may result in problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, especially in regards to immunoblot assays, although it may be less important for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/169/2/313.abstract?ijkey=575b92fb19da9611b73c374a6947577b14843bee&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>). However, ELISAs using the C6 peptide are reported to overcome these problems (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/333.long>). We are not told if there are similar problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis due to candidatus _B. mayonii_.The following is the abstract from reference 1 above:""Background-----------Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. It is a multisystem disease caused by _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies and characterised by tissue localisation and low spirochaetaemia. In this study, we aimed to describe a novel _Borrelia_ species causing Lyme borreliosis in the USA.""Methods--------At the Mayo clinic, from 2003 to 2014, we tested routine clinical diagnostic specimens from patients in the USA with PCR targeting the oppA1 gene of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato. We identified positive specimens with an atypical PCR result (melting temperature outside of the expected range) by sequencing, microscopy, or culture. We collected _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks from regions of suspected patient tick exposure and tested them by oppA1 PCR.""Findings---------100Ûö545 specimens were submitted by physicians for routine PCR from [1 Jan 2003] to [30 Sep 2014]. From these samples, 6 clinical specimens (5 blood, 1 synovial fluid) yielded an atypical oppA1 PCR product, but no atypical results were detected before 2012. 5 of the 6 patients with atypical PCR results had presented with fever, 4 had diffuse or focal rash, 3 had symptoms suggestive of neurological inclusion, and 2 were admitted to hospital. The 6th patient presented with knee pain and swelling. Motile spirochaetes were seen in blood samples from 1 patient and cultured from blood samples from 2 patients. Among the 5 blood specimens, the median oppA1 copy number was 180 times higher than that in 13 specimens that tested positive for _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto during the same time period. Multigene sequencing identified the spirochaete as a novel _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies. This same genospecies was detected in ticks collected at a probable patient exposure site.""Interpretation---------------We describe a new pathogenic _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies (candidatus _B. mayonii_) in the upper Midwestern USA, which causes Lyme borreliosis with unusually high spirochaetaemia. Clinicians should be aware of this new _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies, its distinct clinical features, and the usefulness of oppA1 PCR for diagnosis."" - Mod.ML][This causative agent of Lyme borreliosis appears to be quite rare and limited at this time to the upper Midwestern USA. - Mod.LMA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
