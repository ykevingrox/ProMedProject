Agencia EFE [in Spanish, trans. Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ, edited]<https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/infecciÌ n-bacteriana-hospital-causa-muerte-4-menores-guatemala-223900204.html>Zulma CalderÌ n, head of hospital supervision for the office of the judge advocate general of human rights [la ProcuradurÌ a de los Derechos Humanos (PDH)] reported to EFE [news agency] that a bacterial infection whose cause is being investigated killed 4 children and affected another 25 between June and August [2016] at a hospital in Guatemala.An anonymous complaint alerted the PDH of increased mortality in the Hospital Infantil de InfectologÌ a y RehabilitaciÌ n [children's hospital for infectious diseases and rehabilitation], located in [Guatemala City], capital of the Central American country.The bacterium _Serratia marcescens_ was present in saline and mixed solutions administered to patients, which spread through the bloodstream causing [the death] or exacerbating the illness that resulted in the deaths of 4 children.The other 25 have already been discharged from the hospital, which withdrew about 7000 products for fear they could also be contaminated. These products had been stored in the hospital cellars for 18 months, a strange measure given the shortage of resources the country's health system has suffered for months.CalderÌ n said doctors at the center informed their superiors of what had happened, but no action was taken, demonstrating that the ""chain of supervision is very weak"". The case was made known to the public ministry (MP-Prosecutor) last [30 Aug 2016] to determine any legal responsibility for the events. Guatemala's health system suffers from a severe supply crisis, which has even caused the closure of some health centers.--communicated byProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>viaKathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[_Serratia marcescens_ are Gram negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria of the _Enterobacteriaceae_ family that have been reported to cause nosocomial outbreaks in children (1-7). _S. marcescens_ is a common environmental contaminant. A focal source in one of these outbreaks involved contaminated liquid soap used for handwashing (7). Colonized or infected patients and contaminated environmental surfaces represent important reservoirs for these organisms. Transmission through carriage on the hands of healthcare personnel is an important route in many of these outbreaks. Barrier precautions (contact isolation/cohorting of colonized and infected patients, the use of gloves and gowns), in addition to strictly performed hand disinfection, rigorous environmental cleaning and disinfection of medical equipment and wards, have been used for containment of outbreaks. Contaminated intravenous fluids (such as normal saline, lactated Ringers) may also be a source for a nosocomial outbreak (ProMED-mail post Serratia marcescens - Venezuela (02): (CA) NICU, fatal 20120417.1103584).The news report above says that _S. marcescens_ was present in saline and ""mixed solutions"" administered, presumably intravenously, to patients. What were these ""mixed solutions""? Preparation of ""mixed solutions"" requires use of sterile techniques to avoid microbial contamination and well-trained personnel, but apparently the bottles of saline solution were already contaminated with _S. marcescens_. We are told these bottles had been stored in the hospital cellars for 18 months. What were the conditions of storage? Were just the bottles of saline stored or were the ""mixed solutions"" also similarly stored? What was the shelf-life and storage conditions recommended by the manufacturer for the bottles of saline? Beyond the recommended shelf-life, the manufacturer does not guarantee the sterility, safety, or stability of the item. Where were the bottles of saline manufactured? Were the bottles of saline also distributed to other healthcare institutions and are there contaminated bottles of saline and outbreaks of _S. marcescens_ at these other facilities? Did all the affected children receive the contaminated solutions or did some become infected by other routes?Genotyping of clinical isolates can confirm that this is a common source outbreak; genotyping the isolates from the saline bottles and other environmental isolates can confirm the source of this outbreak.ProMED-mail would appreciate from knowledgeable sources the results of further investigations to find the cause of this outbreak.References----------1.
