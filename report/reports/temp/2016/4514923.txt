[He stated] that medical experts failed to diagnose the problem.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report is vague on the clinical description of the illness that has affected 32 people and caused the death of 6 people in 3 villages in the East Godavari district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. We are only told of ""leg swelling"", which could be a consequence of heart, kidney or liver involvement, but is too nondescript to warrant further conjecture. ProMED-mail would appreciate a more detailed description of this outbreak from knowledgeable sources.Rajahmundry (also called Rajamahendravaram), with a population of 341 831 in 2011, is the 6th most populous city in East Godavari district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajahmundry>).
