Lost Coast Outpost [edited]<https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2016/jul/15/two-dogs-attacked-rabid-foxes-near-hydesville-two/>A total of 2 dogs from the Hydesville [Humboldt County, California] area were attacked by foxes that subsequently tested positive for rabies. Both dogs have been placed under 30-day, strict isolation quarantines. One of the incidents involved human exposures, with 2 people now receiving prophylactic treatment.In addition to these incidents, a bat in the Eureka area has tested positive for rabies, and the remains of a skunk, a 2nd bat and a 3rd Hydesville fox are currently being tested at the Department of Health & Human Services Public Health Laboratory in Eureka.So far this year, 25 specimens have been tested for rabies. Public Health officials caution against shooting animals in the head. ""Because intact brain tissue is needed for an accurate lab test, shooting an animal in the head can delay and disrupt results,"" said Supervising Environmental Health Specialist Amanda Ruddy. When a test is incomplete or inconclusive, the specimen is treated as if rabid, leading to potentially unnecessary courses of action such as human prophylaxis and animal quarantines. Experts say rabies is always present in the wildlife population throughout Humboldt County, especially among skunks, bats and foxes.Preventive measures include avoiding contact with wild and stray animals, bringing pet foods indoors at night, reporting animal bites to your county or municipal animal control officer, and if you are bitten, washing the bite immediately with soap and water and seeking medical attention.Public Health officials stress the importance of fully vaccinating domestic animals against rabies, including dogs, cats and select livestock.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of the USA can be seen at <http://geology.com/world/the-united-states-of-america-satellite-image.shtml> (click on individual states) and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] California - batDate: Thu 14 Jul 2016Source: The Coast News Group [edited]<http://www.thecoastnews.com/2016/07/14/another-rabid-bat-found-at-safari-park/>Another bat found lying on the ground at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park has tested positive for rabies, according to a report from the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency.The bat was found alive on 10 Jul [2016] at approximately 2:15 p.m. near the Oasis Deli in Nairobi Village.

""It is not unusual to see positive rabies cases occasionally in Worth County, or elsewhere in the 14-county Southwest Health District,"" said Worth County Health Department Lead Environmental Health Specialist Laura Searcy. ""Wild animals living in our area that are known to harbor the disease include raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, bobcats and coyotes.""When infected animals come into contact with strays or unvaccinated pets, they can pass the infection. If untreated in humans, rabies is nearly always fatal, Searcy said. ""We are concerned about people being exposed to the rabies virus through pets whose vaccinations are not up-to-date, through stray animals that have not been vaccinated and through wild animals, any of which could catch the infection and pass it along through their saliva,"" she said.Humans should avoid wildlife that behaves oddly, such as nocturnal animals being out during daylight hours or wild animals seeking human interaction. The best protection against rabies exposure is to vaccinate pets. Anyone bitten by wild animals or strays should seek immediate medical attention and contact the Worth County Health Department and law enforcement, she said.Georgia law requires dogs and cats 3 months old and older to be vaccinated against rabies. Pet ferrets should also receive rabies inoculations, as should susceptible livestock.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[6] Georgia - coyote, human exposureDate: Thu 14 Jul 2016, 2:53 AMSource: 11alive.com [edited]<http://www.11alive.com/news/health/fulton-county-health-department-confirms-rabid-coyote-attack/272599326>A spokesperson with the Fulton County [Georgia] Department of Health and Wellness said that a person was attacked by a rabid coyote in the area of Leita Thompson Memorial Park at 1200 Woodstock Road.

Rabies was also previously confirmed in 4 raccoons and a skunk.The bat was discovered in the home by the owner. It was removed by an animal control officer and sent to the state lab for testing where it was confirmed positive for rabies on 13 Jul [2016]. An investigation by the Division of Public Health determined that the homeowner and a pet dog may have been exposed. Public health officials advised the owner to contact his physician to discuss post-exposure rabies treatment. The dog was placed on a 45-day observation period and provided with a rabies booster vaccination.Rabies is a viral disease that can be fatal if left untreated. Atlantic County reported 8 rabies cases in 2015 among bats, skunks, raccoons and a fox. Pet owners are advised to protect their pets with a rabies vaccination.Dogs and cats who receive an initial rabies vaccination are not considered immunized until 28 days after the vaccine has been administered, therefore it is strongly recommended that any animal newly vaccinated or those too young to receive the vaccine (less than 3 months) not be left outdoors unattended. Situations have arisen where pet owners have left unvaccinated or newly vaccinated pets outdoors where they have sustained exposures to known or suspect rabid animals, resulting in euthanasia or 6 months strict confinement.Public health officials also advise residents to teach your children to stay away from wild, stray or aggressive animals. Never feed or touch wild animals or try to keep them as pets. If you are bitten by an animal, wash the wound immediately with soap and water and seek medical attention.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[9] Massachusetts - cat, human exposureDate: Wed 13 Jul 2016, 07:58 PM EDTSource: The Berkshire Eagle [edited]<http://www.berkshireeagle.com/local/ci_30125526/north-adams-rabies-case-prompts-response-chase-hill>In response to a confirmed case of rabies in the Chase Hill neighborhood, several government agencies and local animal organizations are teaming up to offer free rabies vaccinations today, in addition to a coordinated effort to trap and treat feral and wild cats in the area. After the trapped cats are vaccinated and spayed or neutered, they will be released to the area in which they were captured.The cat that prompted this community response reportedly scratched a child and eventually tested positive for rabies on 2 Jun [2016], according to Mayor Richard Alcombright. The city then used its emergency notification system to alert nearby residents of the issue and ask them to be on the lookout for sick animals, he said.According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, rabies is ""fairly common"" in Massachusetts. While animals may act aggressively if they are infected, it is not always possible to spot or confirm a rabid animal by behavior alone.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******Canada---[10] British Columbia - batDate: Fri 15 Jul 2016Source: CFJW.FM [edited]<http://www.cjfw.ca/News/Story.aspx?ID=2198452>The regional health authority is allaying concerns about rabies in the Terrace area [British Columbia]. According to Northern health, a local man was treated for the disease recently, after being dive bombed by a bat in broad daylight. The bat was killed and subsequently tested positive for rabies.However Medical Health officer Dr. Raina Fumerton says the case is no cause for alarm. ""Every once in a while a bat might infect another animal which is why we recommend that people vaccinate their pets, but the most common and significant risk would come from an direct bite from an infected bat,"" she said. Fumerton says bats are the only mammals in BC known to carry the rabies virus, although the number of infected bats is less than 1 percent of the population.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Canada can be seen at <https://canadaalive.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/canada_political_map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[11] Saskatchewan - bat, skunkDate: Thu 14 Jul 2016, 5:07 PM CTSource: CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) News [edited]<http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-health-bat-rabies-1.3679857>A bat found in a backyard in Regina's Cathedral [Saskatchewan] neighborhood has tested positive for rabies, health officials announced [Thu 14 Jul 2016]. The infected animal is the 3rd positive case in 6 years noted by the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region. ""This occurs from time to time,"" Dr. Maurice Hennink, the deputy medical health officer for the region, said. Hennink said people need not be concerned but should follow basic precautions when it comes to bats. ""People should be aware that if you see a bat that is behaving abnormally, not flying properly, just lying on the ground etc. to not touch it,"" he said. If you must handle it, he said, you should wear protective gloves and contact the health region.Hennink said officials would assess the situation to determine if further testing of the animal was necessary due to suspicious of rabies. He said there is no need to test all bats people encounter unless there is an indication that the animal is behaving abnormally. In the most recent case, the bat appeared to be dead and non-responsive, but was alive.He said there has also been an increase in the number of skunks testing positive for rabies in rural parts of the province. He said that, too, is normal. Rabies affects the nervous system and -- as it progresses -- affects the mobility of the animal infected. The virus eventually leads to death. Hennink noted there is no way to reverse rabies, once it has taken hold. ""Any bat that we submit for testing will have some abnormality,"" he said. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[12] Ontario - batDate: Fri 15 Jul 2016, 11:54 AMSource: The Weather Network [edited]<https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/city-of-hamilton-confirms-first-case-of-bat-rabies-in-2016/70135>To date [15 Jul 2016], a total of 121 rabid animals have been found in the [Hamilton, Ontario] area this year.
