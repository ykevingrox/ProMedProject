The disease was confirmed the next day. Visits have been restricted for symptomatic patients, who are being isolated, and the 128-bed nursing home has not been allowed to admit any more residents until further notice, Zaleski said. The nursing home has put signs at the entrance and informed family members. The investigation by the health department, which is the lead agency in such cases, is ongoing, Zaleski said. Norwegian, or crusted, scabies is a severe form of the disease caused by an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with Norwegian scabies have thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of mites and their eggs. The disease is spread by both direct skin-to-skin contact and contamination of clothing, bedding and furniture. Nursing homes, extended-care facilities, prisons and other crowded places where close skin contact is frequent are common sites of scabies outbreaks, according to the CDC.Norwegian scabies is most common with the elderly, the disabled and people with compromised immune systems. The disease is so contagious that the CDC recommends aggressive measures and prophylaxis with 1 confirmed case. All residents and staff finished their first course of prophylaxis for the disease Fri [8 Jul 2016], which consists of an oral medication and applying a cream from the neck down for 12 hours, Zaleski said. The treatment will be repeated in a week.Valley Hi Administrator Tom Annarella could not be reached for comment late Fri [8 Jul 2016]. The home west of Woodstock employs the equivalent of 136 full-time staff, according to the country's 2016 budget.[Byline: Kevin P.

Scabies occur worldwide from arctic to tropical areas and are a well known disease of poverty and poor hygiene.The medication described here taken orally is probably Ivermectin, which has been found to kill the scabies mites buried in the skin and the ointment is probably a permethrin containing ointment. - Mod.EP][A slide set on scabies is available at:<http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-scabies-overview>.
