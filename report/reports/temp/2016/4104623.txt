Detroit News [edited]<http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/03/17/michigan-wisconsin-outbreak/81940740/>Health officials have confirmed that a western Michigan resident died after contracting a bloodstream infection matching a Wisconsin outbreak. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday, 17 Mar 2016, that it was notified 11 Mar 2016 by the CDC of the match. The person was described as an older adult with underlying health conditions. Officials were trying to determine where the infection was contracted, Michigan health department spokeswoman Jennifer Eisner said in an email.In Wisconsin, 17 people with infections caused by _Elizabethkingia_ bacteria have died since November [2015]. The outbreak is the largest recorded in published literature, officials have said.Wisconsin health officials said on their website earlier this week that the total number of reported cases stood at 54. Infections were centered in the heavily populated southeastern quarter of the state, including the Milwaukee area and surrounding suburban counties.The bacterium is named for Elizabeth O. King, a CDC bacteriologist who studied meningitis in infants. The organism is common in the environment, including water and soil, but it rarely causes infections.The Michigan case has the ""same genetic fingerprint"" as the ones in Wisconsin, CDC spokeswoman Melissa Brower told The Associated Press on Thursday, 17 Mar 2016. ""We really don't know how this person in Michigan may have contracted it,"" Brower added. But ""it shouldn't be assumed that this person has been in Wisconsin because it's the same geographic region"" as Michigan, she said.The majority of the Wisconsin patients infected are 65 or older with a history of at least one underlying serious illness, Wisconsin's health department said. Those who died all tested positive for the infection, but it's not known if _Elizabethkingia_ caused or contributed to their deaths.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It has not been stated where in western Michigan the case was located or if the patient had been in Wisconsin. The state of Michigan consists of 2 peninsulas. Most of the population lives in the lower peninsula, which is separated from Wisconsin by Lake Michigan. The upper peninsula of Michigan borders northeast Wisconsin, not close to the southeastern area of Wisconsin where the 54 cases are clustered.There continues to be no information regarding the epidemiology of the still growing number of cases and deaths. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
