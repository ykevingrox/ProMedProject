In all cases, individuals had taken field trips to Nelson Farm, according to a health advisory issued by the agency 26 May [2016].On the morning of 26 May [2016], Department of Health officials visited the farm to tour its facilities, according to the Nelson Farm owner.""Right now we don't even know if it came from our farm,"" he said. ""We won't know until next week (when the test results come back).""Outbreaks associated with farm animal contact may include multiple pathogens including _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_, Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC), and _Cryptosporidium_, the health advisory states. The incubation period for these illnesses range from 12 hours to as long as 14 days.The Nelson Farm owner said he was informed the evening of 25 May [2016] of the possible outbreak, which came as a surprise. ""We won't deny that there is chance we wouldn't have anything because everything has bacteria,"" she added, but emphasized that the Department of Health has not confirmed whether Nelson Farm caused the outbreak.Since being notified by the state, the Nelson Farm owner has called all the schools that visited Nelson Farm since May 9 to see if children have gotten sick, one of which was the School of St. Philip. Nearly 20 kindergarten, 1st-grade and 2nd-grade students at the School of St. Philip visited the farm 23 May [2016] for their annual spring field trip. ""At this point we have not heard of any instances associated with that outbreak, the school principal said.While on the farm, students toured an old barn, visited animals, played in the hay barn and had lunch at the farm. ""I'm sure we'll be back at Nelson Farm next year. These things happen, and we have to take every precaution that we can, but we're not going to cut them out of our school schedule because they have a very great deal to add to our programming here,"" the school principal said.Nelson Farm hosted field trips until 25 May [2016], and field trips will resume in the fall [2016] when school starts again. For the Nelson Farm owners the investigation has become a teaching opportunity in how to prevent the transmission of illnesses. The Nelson Farm owners emphasize the importance of washing hands when touching livestock at the farm as well as county and state fairs.Hand sanitizer is different than hand washing, he said. Some hand sanitizers kill about 99 percent of germs, but the remaining 1 percent is left on the hands. Whereas if a visitor were to wash their hands the 1 percent would go down the drain.[Byline: Martha Lueders]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
