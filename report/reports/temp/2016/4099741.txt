The Weekly Times Now, Australian Associated Press (AAP) report [edited]<http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/breaking-news/sydney-legionnaires-outbreak-contained/news-story/79f30375bf06f40cda28d5c5079f4c1f>An elderly man has died after an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Sydney's CBD [central business district], but the state government now believes the crisis is over.NSW [New South Wales] Health has confirmed a total of 9 people contracted the potentially fatal disease, which is believed to have been spread by a contaminated cooling tower in the populous Town Hall area.The same strain of the disease was found in a man in his 80s who died over the weekend [12-13 Mar 2016]; however, he also had a ""serious underlying condition,"" NSW Health communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard said on [Wed 16 Mar 2016]. She said all of the 9 people affected had spent time within central Sydney in late February [2016].""No cases of legionnaires' disease linked to the Sydney CBD have developed since [4 Mar 2016], suggesting the outbreak may be over,"" she said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 16 Mar 2016Source: Sydney Morning Herald [edited]<http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/first-legionnaires-death-in-town-hall-outbreak-20160316-gnk7a8.html>An inspection of the city's [Sydney] cooling towers has failed to identify the source of the legionnaires' outbreak encircling the Town Hall area.Health authorities confirmed on [Wed 16 Mar 2016] that they had inspected and sampled all cooling towers and other potential _Legionella_ sources such as decorative fountains in an area stretching from Elizabeth Street to Clarence Street, and Bathurst Street to King Street. But the search is now complete, with inspectors none the wiser as to the source of the infection that has caused the hospitalisation of 9 people and the death of an octogenarian.NSW Health director of communicable diseases Vicky Sheppeard said authorities were informed about the 9th case on [Sun 13 Mar 2016], the same day that the patient was diagnosed, and a lab test confirmed a link with the current outbreak 2 days later.So far, 5 patients have been discharged since contracting the disease; 3 are still being treated in hospital, and the condition of the person previously reported as being in intensive care has improved.Health officials believe that the outbreak is now over, as no new cases have been detected since [4 Mar 2016] and the incubation period is 2 to 10 days. ""In such outbreaks it's not uncommon that the source is unable to be identified, however, no further cases of legionnaires' disease have had onset since [4 Mar 2016],"" Dr Sheppeard said. ""Doctors, laboratories, and hospitals have been actively monitoring for new cases and there has been a high level of community awareness.""The investigation will now turn to analysing -- or ""genetic fingerprinting"" -- the samples obtained from the cooling towers and patients, a process that will take longer to complete.The disease causes coughs, chills, and fever and usually affects middle-aged or older people, heavy smokers, and those with chronic lung disease.NSW Health director of communicable diseases Vicky Sheppeard said investigations into the source of the outbreak were continuing. Authorities suspect that a contaminated water cooling tower may have blown out particles of the bacteria that were inhaled by people in Sydney's CBD. The towers cool the water that is used in air conditioning units of large buildings.The City of Sydney has inspected water-cooling towers in an area bounded by Kent, Pitt, Druitt, and Bathurst streets in the 2 days since [Mon 14 Mar 2016]. Earlier, it inspected possible sources of _Legionella_ in the area bounded by Elizabeth, King, Clarence, Park, and Druitt streets.[Byline: Harriet Alexander]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The news releases above report an additional 5 patients, for a total of 9 patients, with legionnaires' disease since the last ProMED-mail post on this outbreak in Sydney's central business district. There apparently is a single _Legionella_ genotype shared by these patients, which suggests a common source, since we are told in the news reports above that ""a lab test [presumably genotyping of the _Legionella_ isolate] confirmed a link [of the 9th case] with the current outbreak.""The outbreak has been attributed to a contaminated cooling tower in the Town Hall area. Although we are told that inspection of the city's cooling towers and other potential _Legionella_ sources, such as decorative fountains encircling the Town Hall area failed to identify the source of the legionnaires' outbreak, ""the investigation will now turn to analysing -- or 'genetic fingerprinting' -- the samples obtained from the cooling towers and patients, a process that will take longer to complete,"" according to the 2nd news report above.We are not told if any of these contaminated cooling towers have been remediated. If not so, an unremediated cooling tower may still be contaminating the environment. Nevertheless, we are told in the news reports above that health officials believe that the outbreak is now over, as no new cases have been detected in the past 12 days, 10 days being regarded as the maximum incubation period for legionnaires' disease. ProMED-mail would appreciate knowing from knowledgeable sources if it is true that a common genotype has been found in clinical isolates and if any of the contaminated cooling towers have been remediated.Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52293>.Sydney, located on Australia's southeast coast, with a population of about 4.8 million residents, is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney>). - Mod.ML]
