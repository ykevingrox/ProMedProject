EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited][Below is a summary of some of the very helpful responses received today (11 Aug 2016) to an RFI submitted through the EpiCore Surveillance Project. We are very grateful to the EpiCore Project members for their rapid responses (and in some cases submitting follow-up responses as more information became available). Of note, in less than 12 hours we have received 17 responses and they are continuing to come in. - Mod.MPP]a - Both cases are WPV1. Each in Jere and Gwoza local government areas.b - The virus is type 1, all the children are under 3 years of age and have received more than 5 doses. The state has been asked to prepare an immediate response plan to cover the 2 affected wards in Jere and Gwoza LGAs. bOPV is available for this and subsequent rounds that will be mounted in wider areas, targeting more children than the immediate response round. More details will come your way soon. Gwoza LGA because of the insurgents there, is not fully accessible. [Posted already in Poliomyelitis update (10): Nigeria (BO), new cases, RFI 20160811.4408853 earlier today]c - There are 2 cases of WPV in Gwoza and Maiduguri in Borno State, Nigeriad - Confirmed. Circulating indigenous strain. Hard to reach area of Borno State. Poor surveillance due to insecurity.e - WPV1 has been confirmed. Yes there are 2 polio cases.f - WP1 have been confirmed in Borno State, Nigeria. The contact of an index case is positive for WP1 while the index case is negative --Jere Local Government area (LGA) in Borno State. Another index case and 3 contacts have WP1 -- Gwoza LGA. Note: The affected LGAs are security challenged areasFrom: Professor Marycelin Babag - Follow-up information from Professor Marycelin Baba on outbreak of WP1 in Borno State, Nigeria:- The case from Jere LGAA 3 year old male, vaccination : 5 doses (last dose 12 Jul 2016)- Index case from GwozaA 2 year old female, vaccination : 6 doses (last dose 27 Jul 2016)- ContactsNo.1 contact: 4 year old male, vaccination: 8 doses (last dose 20 Jul 2016)No.2 contact: 3 year old male, vaccination : 6 doses (last dose 19 Jul 2016)No.3 contact: 5 year old female, vaccination : 10 doses (last dose 20 Jul 2016)h - Gwoza LGA - One child with acute flaccid paralysis, onset of paralysis on 13 Jul 2016 and close healthy contacts of child. Stool specimen collected on 21 Jul 2016Jere LGA - A healthy contact of child who developed AFP on 6 Jul 2016 (index case has a negative test result. Stool specimen collected on 22 Jul 2016).Genetic sequencing suggests these isolates are mostly linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011i - Two cases of WPV 1.No.1 case: Location Jere LGA of Borno State; Ward: Dusuman Ward; date of onset: 4 Jul 2016From a child at Muna IDP camp housing IDPs from Marte, Mafa, Jere and Dikwa LGAs, which have been inaccessible for over two yearsNo 2 case: Location Gwoza LGA of Borno State; Ward: Hausari; date of onset: 5 May 2016WPV 1 an orphan virus circulating since 2011Gwoza LGA fell to insurgents on the 5 August 2014 it has 13 political wards as at today 5 ward headquarters are accessibleActions:- immediate investigation ongoing- immediate Vaccination to commence on 15 Aug 2016- more detail plans for 3 rounds of immunization ongoing- AFP external peer review called offMore updates will be made available as they unfoldj -  Nigeria, wild polio virus type one (WPV1) has been detected from Borno state. Virus was isolated from 2 local government areas (LGA) of Borno; in Gwoza LGAs, in a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP - onset of paralysis on 13 Jul 2016) and close healthy contacts of that child; and in Jere from a close healthy contact of a child who had developed AFP symptoms on 6 Jul 2016.It is the 1st WPV1 detected in Nigeria since July 2014. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses suggest they are most closely linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection since that time.An outbreak response plan is currently being finalized, consisting of 3 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), the 1st one beginning within 2 weeks, and subsequent rounds being conducted at short intervals (of between 2 to 3 weeks).--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org[I have included a number of the very helpful EpiCore Surveillance Project member responses as they helped to provide a good picture of the current situation.First and foremost, they helped confirm the earlier media report of the identification of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases due to wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). They also provide some background of the areas involved - areas that have been security risks for ongoing routine vaccination as well as surveillance activities and most likely areas that still have pockets of unvaccinated children to help sustain circulation of the WPV1 (which according to reports from the EpiCore members above and the Polio Eradication Initiative advance report below has been in circulation undetected since 2011).The background provided by Dr Marycelin Baba on the vaccination histories of the affected children suggests issues known to be related to the use of OPV -- some may reflect doses of vaccine that may not have been maintained due to cold chain failures, others related to the presence of concurrent infections that prevent the vaccine from binding to receptor sites and result in reduced efficacy of the vaccines. A good overall review of poliomyelitis and specifically the vaccine efficacy issues can be found in the following reference: Nathanson N, Kew OM. From emergence to eradication: the epidemiology of poliomyelitis deconstructed. American Journal of Epidemiology 2010;172(11):1213-1229. doi:10.1093/aje/kwq320. This includes the statement: ""Because of recent problems with persistence of wild polioviruses, vaccine failure has been restudied in Nigeria and India (77, 82). In contrast with historical data, trivalent OPV has conferred much lower levels of protection (77, 82, 83). Table 8 summarizes data from Nigeria, in which a single dose of trivalent OPV was estimated to provide only 16-18 percent protection against paralytic poliomyelitis. Subsequent serologic studies have found substantially higher, but still suboptimal, seroconversion rates in India (20, 21)"".

Virus was isolated from 2 local government areas (LGA) of Borno; in Gwoza LGAs, in a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP - onset of paralysis on [13 Jul 2016]) and close healthy contacts of that child; and in Jere from a close healthy contact of a child who had developed AFP symptoms on [6 Jul 2016]. Both cases are reported by 'advanced notification' this week and will be reflected in the official data next week [scheduled for 18 Aug 2016].It is the 1st WPV1 detected in Nigeria since July 2014. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses suggest they are most closely linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection since that time.An outbreak response plan is currently being finalized, consisting of 3 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), the 1st one beginning within 2 weeks and subsequent rounds being conducted at short intervals (of between 2 to 3 weeks).--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The above Headlines section of this week's Polio Eradication Initiative weekly report is the official confirmation of these WPV1 associated paralytic polio cases and isolation of the virus in healthy contacts as well. The isolation of the WPV1 in a healthy contact of an AFP case (the case in Jere) helped to confirm that the AFP was most likely due to WPV1 infection.A map of Nigeria showing states can be found at: <http://www.waado.org/images/Maps/nigeria2.gif>. Borno state is in the extreme north east of the country bordering with Chad, Cameroon and Niger.A map of Borno state showing LGAs (Local Government Authorities) can be found at <http://16745-presscdn-0-7.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BORNO-STATE-MAP.gif>. Note that Jere LGA is in the center of the state, whereas Gwoza LGA is more than 135 km [approx 84 mi] to the south east of Jere LGA. Gwoza LGA shares a border with Cameroon. According to a Wikipedia background on the region, the Boko Haram insurgents have their hideout in Gwoza LGA, hence making the LGA a very high security risk <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwoza>.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Nigeria can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>, and Borno specifically at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/621>. - Mod.MPP]
