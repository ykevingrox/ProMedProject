Gabriel Pontes said that the campaign in this location is in response to the yellow fever epidemiological situation affecting the country, particularly Malanje, they have asked the people of Cacuso to join the campaign to eradicate the disease, which has already caused 3 deaths in the province.The provincial director of Health, Pedro JosÌ© Antonio, recalled that the 1st signs of yellow fever began to be recorded in 2015, having affected several people at the national level and has now resulted in many deaths. Pedro Jose Antonio said that the Malanje provincial government, through the Provincial Health Directorate, embraced measures to prevent occurrence of any more deaths and people affected by yellow fever. In order to prevent the spread of the disease, the responsible official supported the idea of conducting training among health workers, at the level of provincial health units, to facilitate the diagnosis and detection of suspected cases of the epidemic.The provincial Health Directorate recorded, as of the 1st fortnight of Jun, a total of 21 suspected cases of the disease, 6 of which confirmed by the authorities, resulting in 3 deaths. Cacuso, Malanje, Cahombo and Quela are the municipalities most affected by the epidemic. The provincial Director of Health assured that conditions are created for the province of Malanje province to vaccinate the entire population, with particular emphasis on the cities of Malanje and Cacuso.The municipal administrator of Cacuso, Caetano Tintas, welcomed the initiative of health authorities and mourned the deaths caused by yellow fever that could have been prevented through the implementation of vaccination campaigns and once and for all eradicate the epidemic. Caetano Tintas highlighted conducting community meetings, which serve to raise awareness about the importance of sanitation in the context of preventive health.[Byline: Adriano Sapalo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[It is good to see vaccination efforts conducted at the local level, focused on localities of recognized risk. Public education is also an important step for communication cooperation. However, the target is the vaccination of 600 000 people, but the health authorities apparently have secured 100 000 doses of the vaccine. Even if the 1/5 dose strategy were to be implemented, there is not enough vaccine to reach the population. There is no indication of how the vaccine shortfall will be covered unless there are additional doses not mentioned in the above report.Malanje province is located in northern Angola and shares a border with the DR Congo. Vaccination in these border areas is important because the border is leaky and there is an ongoing risk of yellow fever (YF) viremic individuals crossing into their northern neighbor and coming down with YF there or perhaps initiating transmission, as has been occurring.A map showing the location of Malanje province can be accessed at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malanje> and a map of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.]
