Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Epidemiological Update: Cholera [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=36116&lang=en>Cholera in the Americas -- situation summary--------------------------------------------Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 34 of 2016, a total of 27 839 cholera cases were reported in 3 countries of the Americas: the Dominican Republic (1039), Ecuador (1), and Haiti (26 799). Haiti alone accounts for 96 per cent of all cholera cases reported in the Region of the Americas up to EW 33 of 2016. Table 1 shows the number of cholera cases reported in selected countries between 2010 and 2016. Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL] illustrates the distribution of cumulative cases of cholera in Hispaniola.In Haiti, a total of 26 799 suspected cholera cases, including 242 related deaths (case fatality rate: 0.90 per cent), were reported from EW 1 to EW 34 of 2016. The numbers of cases and deaths reported in 2016 are higher than those reported during the same period in 2015 and 2014, although the case fatality rate at the national level is lower than that registered in 2014 (1.05 per cent) and similar to that of 2015 (0.89 per cent) (figure 2). In the Dominican Republic, a total of 1039 suspected cholera cases, including 18 related deaths (case fatality rate: 1.7 per cent), were reported from EW 1 to EW 32 of 2016. As shown in Table 1, this is almost twice the number of cases reported in 2014 (603 cases, including 11 deaths) and 2015 (546 cases, including 15 deaths), although the case fatality rate is lower than those registered in 2014 (1.82 per cent) and 2015 (2.74 per cent).Table 1: Cholera Cases (Deaths) in selected countries in the Americas, 2010-2016.
