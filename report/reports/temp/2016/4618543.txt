Zika virus pandemic--analysis of Facebook as a social media health information platform.Highlights- The arrival of Zika virus in America has generated a lot of awareness in social media due to the algorithmic increase in the spread of the disease and its concerning complications.- Accurate & credible dissemination of correct information about the arbovirus could help in decreasing the pandemic spread and associated apprehension in the population.- Our study examined the effective use of the social media site Facebook as an information source for the Zika virus pandemic.- We found that the misleading posts were far more popular than the posts dispersing accurate relevant public health information about the disease.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report raises a serious concern for all in the public health field in the United States, and probably other countries as well. Dealing with outbreaks by health professionals depends on public collaboration and political support. That support will not be forthcoming if false information and denial circulate more than established facts do. The challenge now becomes how best to disseminate accurate information to the public and political and policy decision-makers when more accurate, traditional sources are consulted less than social media outlets are. Meeting that challenge by the public health community is urgent. - Mod.TY]******[3] Zika spreadDate: January 2017 [ahead of print]Source: Emerg Infect Dis.

Reconstruction of Zika virus introduction in Brazil.AbstractWe estimated the speed of Zika virus introduction in Brazil by using confirmed cases at the municipal level. Our models indicate a southward pattern of introduction starting from the north eastern coast and a pattern of movement toward the western border with an average speed of spread of 42 km/day [26.1 miles/day] or 15 367 km/year [9549 miles/year].--communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[The rapid spread of Zika virus in this area, 42 km/day, is indicative of the role of infected, viremic individuals in its dissemination. The spread is doubtless facilitated by most infected individuals being asymptomatic and feeling well enough to travel. - Mod.TY]******[4] Genome comparisonDate: Fri 21 Oct 2016 [on line ahead of print]Source: Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine [edited]<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1995764516303625>Theerarat Kochakar, Namfon Kotanan, Krittikorn Kumpornsin, Duangkamon Loesbanluechai, Monta Thammasatta, Prasert Auewarakul, et al. Comparative genome analysis between Southeast Asian and South American Zika viruses.AbstractObjective: To understand the cause for the differences between potentially mild Southeast Asian and the more pathogenic ZIKV in South America.Methods: A comparative genomic analysis was performed to determine putative causations stemming from ZIKV.Results: Phylogenetic analyses integrating geographical and time factors revealed that Southeast Asian ZIKV might not be the direct source of South American outbreaks as previously speculated. Amino acid residues unique to South American ZIKV isolates at the envelope pr and NS1 proteins are listed and shown in the structural context. These unique residues on external viral proteins are not found in Southeast Asian ZIKV and could be responsible for the ongoing outbreak either via an intrinsic property of the virus or interactions with human immunity. Only a selected few primer/probe sets currently in clinical use were identified as being capable of detecting ZIKV strains worldwide. The envelope proteins of dengue virus (DENV) and ZIKV also showed a remarkable degree of similarity, especially at the surface residues.Conclusions: These findings may help explain the cross-reactivity of DENV antibodies to ZIKV. Thus, major caveats must be exercised in using existing diagnostic tools for ZIKV.--communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[If the Zika virus circulating in the Americas is not of South East Asia origin, then where is it from? Other investigators have indicated that the Zika virus in the Americas is similar to that which circulated in French Polynesia, that, in turn, has been identified as of Asian origin. One hopes that there is a Zika virus repository that is collecting isolates from around the world for future genome comparisons. - Mod.TY]******[5] Virus-cell dynamicsDate: Mon 24 Oct 2016Source: Los Alamos National Laboratory [edited]<http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-16-28095>Best K, Guedj J, Madelain V, de Lamballerie X, L S-Y, Osuna CE, et al. Modeling Zika plasma viral dynamics in non-human primates: insights into viral pathogenesis and antiviral strategies.The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with fetal abnormalities and neurological complications, prompting global concern. Here, we present the 1st mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of plasma ZIKV burden in a non-human primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within an individual macaque. We find that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is short (around 4 hours), the median within-host basic reproductive number is approximately 9, and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is about 6 hours. We also estimate that the average number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is about 6000, although the assumed target cell density, 105/ml, influences this estimate. We also assessed the potential effect of an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication, showing that the median time-to undetectable plasma viral load (VL) can be reduced from 5 days to 3 days or less with a drug concentration 10 times or more of the drug's EC50 when treatment is given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. Treatment given 2 days or more post-infection is ineffective in reducing peak plasma VL or time to undetectable plasma VL. In the case of favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor with activity against ZIKV, we predict that a dose of 150 mg/kg given twice a day initiated at the time of infection can reduce the peak VL by approximately 3 logs and shortened the time to undetectable VL by about 3 days.--communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[There are 3 questions concerning the use of the drug favipiravir: is the reduction in viremia sufficient to prevent infection of the placenta and the fetus; and 2nd, can it be tolerated by pregnant women? If the drug is ineffective if given at or after 2 days post infection, is that practical, since symptoms appear much later if at all? One hopes that a safe, effective drug will be developed that can answer these 3 questions satisfactorily and that it is cheap enough to be afforded by women in countries of limited resources. - Mod.TY]******[6] Monoclonal antibody treatmentDate: Mon 7 Nov 2016Source: Nature [edited]<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaap/ncurrent/full/nature20564.html>Gopal Sapparapu, Estefania Fernandez, Nurgun Kose, Bin Cao, et al. Neutralizing human antibodies prevent Zika virus replication and fetal disease in mice.AbstractZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that can cause severe disease, including congenital birth defects during pregnancy. To develop candidate therapeutic agents against ZIKV, we isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from subjects with prior ZIKV infection. A subset of mAbs recognized diverse epitopes on the envelope (E) protein and exhibited potently neutralizing activity. One of the most inhibitory mAbs, ZIKV-117, broadly neutralized infection of ZIKV strains corresponding to African, Asian, and American lineages. Epitope mapping studies revealed that ZIKV-117 recognized a unique quaternary epitope on the E protein dimer-dimer interface. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of ZIKV-117 in pregnant and non-pregnant mice. mAb treatment markedly reduced tissue pathology, placental and fetal infection, and mortality in mice. Thus, neutralizing human mAbs can protect against maternal-fetal transmission, infection and disease, and reveal important determinants for structure-based rational vaccine design efforts.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These results may provide structural insights useful in vaccine development. These types of very Zika-virus specific MAbs will have a variety of uses for better understanding of virus-host relationships. In the above experiments, the mAb ZIKV-117 provided reduced fetal infection and mortality. The practical use of the mAB to prevent reduce human disease and fetal effects is not clear, since the mAb was administered one day prior to infection with the virus, a possible challenge since 80 percent of individuals do not realize that they have been infected by the virus. Its ameliorating effects in human infections when symptoms occur 5-7 days after the initiation of symptoms, if symptoms occur at all, is uncertain.******[7] Vaccine trialsDate: Mon 7 Nov 2016Source: USA National Institutes of Health News Releases [edited]<https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/testing-investigational-inactivated-zika-vaccine-humans-begins>The 1st of 5 early stage clinical trials to test the safety and ability of an investigational Zika vaccine candidate called the Zika Purified Inactivated Virus (ZPIV) vaccine to generate an immune system response has begun at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Clinical Trial Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. Scientists with WRAIR, part of the US Department of Defense (DoD), developed the vaccine. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is co-funding the Phase 1 clinical trial with WRAIR, serving as the regulatory sponsor and providing other support.In coming months, 4 additional Phase 1 studies to evaluate the ZPIV investigational vaccine are expected to launch. These include:A trial enrolling 90 adults ages 18-49 years at the Center for Vaccine Development at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. This site is an NIAID-funded Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit, and Sarah George MD, will serve as principal investigator. All participants will receive either 2 injections of ZPIV or a placebo 28 days apart. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a high, moderate or low dose at both injections to evaluate the optimal dose for use in larger future studies.A trial enrolling 90 adults ages 21-49 years at the clinical research center CAIMED, part of Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico. The site is supported by NIAID via a subcontract from the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. This trial will examine the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity in participants who have already been naturally exposed to dengue virus. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a high dose, moderate dose or a placebo. Elizabeth A Barranco MD, will lead the trial.NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) will test the ZPIV vaccine candidate as a boost vaccination to its DNA Zika vaccine candidate, which entered Phase 1 clinical trials in August [2016]. The next part of the study, which will enroll 60 additional participants ages 18-50 years, will take place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Institute for Global Health in Baltimore, and Emory University in Atlanta. Half of the participants will receive the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine followed by a ZPIV vaccine boost 4 or 12 weeks later. The remaining participants will receive only 2 doses of ZPIV vaccine 4 or 12 weeks apart. Julie Ledgerwood DO, chief of the VRC's clinical trials program, will serve as principal investigator.A WRAIR-funded trial enrolling 48 adults ages 18-50 years will be conducted at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, part of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston. One group of participants will receive a single dose of the ZPIV vaccine, and all other participants will receive 2 doses of the ZPIV vaccine at varying intervals. Kathryn Stephenson MD MPH, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, will lead the trial.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is good to see Zika virus vaccine development moving along. However, we are still many months away from completed trials and a vaccine or vaccines ready for immunization campaigns in the field. - Mod.TY]
