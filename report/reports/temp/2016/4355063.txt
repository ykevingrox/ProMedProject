The Telegraph Calcutta, India [edited]<http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160719/jsp/bihar/story_97376.jsp#.V45NeVdLWOq>The latest report issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Pune, and Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, has identified a new virus detected in 4 children as Chandipura.While 2 with the Chandipura virus have died, the other 2 are battling for life. Earlier, 3 children were afflicted by herpes simplex virus. So far, pathological tests have confirmed Chandipura virus in 4 children, herpes simplex in 3 and Japanese encephalitis in 3.Anugrah Narayan Medical College (ANMCH) principal Sushil Kumar Mahto told The Telegraph: ""This is the 1st time that Chandipura virus has been detected in Bihar. This virus had been named after Chandipura village in Maharashtra, where it was 1st detected. It has mostly been detected in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and southern India. High fever, cold and cough are the symptoms in a child affected by this virus. There is need for research on it.""ANMCH superintendent Sudhir Kumar Sinha said the mortality rate in Chandipura virus is around 75 percent. The 2 children who died of this on 5 and 9 Jul [2016] respectively were from Imamganj.A team of experts will visit the villages, where Chandipura virus has been detected in children. Principal health secretary R.K. Mahajan had visited ANMCH on Saturday to review treatment of children.[Byline: Alok Kumar]--Communicated by:Ronan KellySenior Moderator, FluTrackers<ronankelly@comcast.net>[Chandipura virus is not ""new"" to India, but apparently has not been reported before from Bihar state. Mod.CP commented in a 2004 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20040923.2621): ""As noted previously in ProMED-mail, Chandipura virus is a ubiquitous infectious agent on the Indian sub-continent which can infect humans and many other mammalian species. The high background of specific antibodies and virus RNA in the population of India combine to obscure any potential role of this virus in pediatric illnesses, and the matter remains unresolved. Until the data accumulated at the Institute of Virology in Pune are published in full, doubt will remain about the significance of Chandipura virus as a human pathogen."" Chandipura virus is transmitted by sandflies (_Phlebotomus argentipes_ and _Sergentomiya_ sp.) that have been implicated in previous outbreaks in India. Chandipura virus is a vesiculovirus in the Rhabdoviridae family.Chandipura virus infections were considered relatively benign prior to the reports of encephalitis coming out of India in 2004. It would be interesting to conduct genomic analysis of Chandipura virus from the current outbreak so that comparative genetic studies can be made of a current Indian isolate with those made during previous outbreaks as well as the prototype virus.ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for sending in this report. - Mod.
