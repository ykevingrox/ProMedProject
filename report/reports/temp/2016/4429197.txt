CBS Los Angeles [edited]<http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/08/17/mosquito-that-could-carry-zika-found-in-riverside-county/>A mosquito breed [species] capable of carrying and transmitting yellow fever and the Zika virus was netted in Hemet, Riverside County [California] health officials reported Wednesday [17 Aug 2016].According to the Department of Environmental Health, an _Aedes aegypti_ specimen was pulled from a vector-control trap Monday [15 Aug 2016] near Johnston Avenue and Yale Street, on the south end of the city.Department spokeswoman Dotti Merki said the little black-and-white mosquitoes, which prefer to feed on prey during the day, have the potential to spread Zika, chikungunya and dengue [viruses], [and is] also known as [the] ""yellow fever"" [mosquito].""While these viruses are not currently transmitted in California, there is a potential for them to be introduced into the state through infected international travelers,"" Merki said. ""In the presence of a large population of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, a traveler who is a carrier and is bitten in California could become a source for transmitting a disease locally.""Last year [2015], the mosquito species were located in several locations in the western part of the county. However, there were no identified cases of dengue, Zika or chikungunya [virus infections] that originated from local sources.Coachella has been contending with infestations of the mosquitoes this summer, prompting insect spraying operations throughout the city. The breed has also been identified recently in parts of Riverside and Corona.Zika [virus infection] usually results in mild fever, a rash, join pain and red eyes. Many people may not be aware they even have it, according to the CDC. Pregnant women are at highest risk, because their newborns [fetuses] can suffer exposure-related deformities.Chikungunya [virus infection] also causes muscle pain and fever. Infants, as well as seniors with underlying medical disorders, are at highest risk of adverse effects. [Severe joint pain that can last months is a characteristic symptom. - Mod.TY]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 12 years (see archives listed below). Both of them have been detected in Southern California in several new locations over the past 1-2 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya or dengue virus transmission. However, the introduction of these viruses into Southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4364>.
