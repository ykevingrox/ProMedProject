Numerous studies confirmed the link.Up to 7 percent of the babies with microcephaly that Van der Linden and her team have treated were also born with arm and leg deformities that had not previously been linked to other causes of microcephaly, she said.To complicate matters, there are babies whose heads were normal at birth but stopped growing proportionally months later. Other infants infected with the virus in the womb did not have microcephaly but developed different problems, such as a patient of Van der Linden's who started having difficulties moving his left hand.""We may not even know about the ones with slight problems out there,"" Van der Linden said.

Zika Virus Infection and Solid Organ Transplantation: A New Challenge. Am J Transplant. 2016 Sep 15. doi: 10.1111/ajt.14047. PMID: 27629942.SummaryPublic health concerns exist surrounding the epidemic of the Zika virus (ZIKV) and the rapid growth of transplantation in developing countries, including endemic zones of active arbovirus transmission, as well as travel to such regions by potential organ donors and recipients. Few data exist regarding the clinical characteristics of ZIKV infection in immunocompromised hosts. Laboratory screening protocols for transplantation to differentiate ZIKV infections from other endemic viral diseases and for the detection of possible donor-derived infection have not been stated. The diagnosis of ZIKV infection remains a challenge, fueled by the lack of standardized commercially available diagnostic tests and validated reference diagnostic laboratories, as well as the limited duration of ZIKV viremia. In this small series, ZIKV infection in renal and liver recipients presented without rash, conjunctivitis, or neurological symptoms, and with abnormal graft function, thrombocytopenia, and bacterial superinfection. We report the 1st case series of ZIKV infection in solid organ recipients, with a description of clinical and laboratory features and therapeutic management.--Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[Organ donors who have had symptoms typical of Zika virus infection can be excluded. However, since 80 percent of individuals infected with this virus are asymptomatic, laboratory testing will be necessary for individuals or their sexual partners who have been in areas of Zika virus transmission to determine if they have been infected with this virus. - Mod.TY]******[5] Microcephaly causeDate: Fri 7 Oct 2016Source: Nature Scientific Reports [edited]<http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34793>Citation: Huang WC, Abraham R, Shim BS, Choe H, Page DT. Zika virus infection during the period of maximal brain growth causes microcephaly and corticospinal neuron apoptosis in wild type mice. Sci Rep. 2016 Oct 7;6:34793. doi: 10.1038/srep34793, PMID: 27713505.AbstractZika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women has been established as a cause of microcephaly in newborns. Here we test the hypothesis that neurodevelopmental stages when the brain is undergoing rapid growth are particularly vulnerable to the effects of ZIKV infection. We injected ZIKV intracranially into wild type C57BL/6 mice at 2 different time points: early postnatal development, when the brain is growing at its maximal rate, and at weaning, when the brain has largely reached adult size. Both time points showed widespread immunoreactivity for ZIKV and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3, a marker of apoptosis) throughout the brain. However, in early postnatal ZIKV injected mice, some brain areas and cell types display particularly large increases in apoptosis that we did not observe in older animals. Corticospinal pyramidal neurons, a cell type implicated in human microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection, are an example of one such cell type. Proliferating cells in the ventricular zone stem cell compartment are also depleted. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that periods of rapid brain growth are especially susceptible to neurodevelopmental effects of ZIKV infection, and establish a valuable model to investigate mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental effects of ZIKV infection and explore candidate therapeutics.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The pathophysiologic mechanism of damage to brain neurodevelopment seen in mice may be difficult to confirm in humans.

Prolonged detection of Zika virus in vaginal secretions and whole blood. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017 Jan 15;23(1). doi: 10.3201/eid2301.161394, PMID: 27748649.ConclusionsGiven recent concerns regarding the ongoing epidemic of Zika virus disease, there is an urgent need to document the natural history of infection and assess transmission risk through nonvector routes. We had the unique opportunity to prospectively monitor the clinical and virologic course of Zika virus infection in a patient starting on day 0.We detected viral shedding in vaginal secretions up to day 14. Only 1 human study reported Zika virus RNA in cervical mucous up to day 11 after onset of signs and symptoms. These findings are supported by recent results for 2 animal models. Zika virus (Asian lineage strain) RNA was detected in vaginal swab specimens obtained on days 1 and 7 postinfection of nonpregnant female rhesus macaques. Zika virus replication was also detected in vaginal mucosa of mice.We could not determine whether positive results by qRT-PCR indicated replicating virus. With the recent finding of possible female-to-male virus transmission, infectious virus might be present in the vaginal canal and could serve as a risk for sexual or intrapartum transmission.We detected viral RNA in serum up to 8 days and in whole blood up to 81 days after onset of illness. Diagnosis of infection currently relies mostly on PCR detection of Zika virus in serum. With concerns for Zika virus infection during pregnancy, screening of whole blood might be more sensitive in identifying infected patients, particularly if an asymptomatic patient has traveled from an area where exposure is a concern, had high-risk sexual contact, or is convalescing and PCR for a serum sample would probably yield a negative result.Our observation is further supported by another recent study that found whole blood samples positive for Zika virus by PCR up to 2 months postinfection. In our study, we confirmed that a positive result was attributed to the erythrocyte component of whole blood, similar to what has been found in studies of West Nile virus. One study found that West Nile virus adheres to erythrocytes and could infect Vero cells. Although we did not observe infectious virus associated with erythrocyte positivity for Zika virus at day 64, this finding is still of concern and requires further investigation. Because the last whole blood sample collected on day 81 was positive for Zika virus RNA, follow-up testing will continue to define the longevity of viremia in whole blood.In conclusion, this case study advances understanding of the natural history of Zika virus. It provides new findings, including detection of Zika virus RNA in vaginal secretions up to day 14 and in erythrocytes up to day 81, the longest reported duration of detection in this sample type. A desquamating rash developed on the hands and feet of the patient, which we presume was related to her infection. To our knowledge, this finding has not been previously described.Additional studies involving larger cohorts of acutely ill Zika virus-infected patients tested over a longer period would solidify our understanding of the natural history of infection, duration of viral detection, and clinical outcomes. These studies will enable further development of evidence-based policies regarding diagnosis and clinical management of Zika virus-infected patients.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Although just a single case, this study provides additional evidence of Zika virus RNA presence in vaginal mucosa. As the authors note, detection of infectious virus in these PCR positive samples would be helpful in assessing the risk of female to male virus transmission. - Mod.TY]******[7] Zika and Guillain-BarrÌ© syndromeDate: Wed 5 Oct 2016Source: N Engl J Med. 2016 [edited]<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27705091>Citation: Parra B, Lizarazo J, JimÌ©nez-Arango JA, et al. Guillain-BarrÌ© Syndrome Associated with Zika Virus Infection in Colombia. N Engl J Med. 2016 Oct 5, [Epub ahead of print], PMID: 27705091 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1605564AbstractBackground Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been linked to the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome. From November 2015 through March 2016, clusters of cases of the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome were observed during the outbreak of ZIKV infection in Colombia. We characterized the clinical features of cases of Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome in the context of this ZIKV infection outbreak and investigated their relationship with ZIKV infection.Methods. A total of 68 patients with the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome at 6 Colombian hospitals were evaluated clinically, and virologic studies were completed for 42 of the patients. We performed reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays for ZIKV in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, as well as antiflavivirus antibody assays.Results. A total of 66 patients (97 percent) had symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection before the onset of the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome. The median period between the onset of symptoms of ZIKV infection and symptoms of the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome was 7 days (interquartile range, 3 - 10). Among the 68 patients with the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome, 50 percent were found to have bilateral facial paralysis on examination. Among 46 patients in whom nerve-conduction studies and electromyography were performed, the results in 36 patients (78 percent) were consistent with the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome. Among the 42 patients who had samples tested for ZIKV by RT-PCR, the results were positive in 17 patients (40 percent). Most of the positive RT-PCR results were in urine samples (in 16 of the 17 patients with positive RT-PCR results), although 3 samples of cerebrospinal fluid were also positive. In 18 of 42 patients (43 percent) with the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome who underwent laboratory testing, the presence of ZIKV infection was supported by clinical and immunologic findings. In 20 of these 42 patients (48 percent), the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome had a parainfectious onset. All patients tested were negative for dengue virus infection as assessed by RT-PCR.Conclusions The evidence of ZIKV infection documented by RT-PCR among patients with the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome during the outbreak of ZIKV infection in Colombia lends support to the role of the infection in the development of the Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report provides additional evidence for the association of confirmed Zika virus infections and Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome. - Mod.TY]******[8] Vector mosquitoes, BrazilDate: Mon 3 Oct 2016Source: Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz 2016 [edited]<http://www.scielo.br/readcube/epdf.php?doi=10.1590/0074-02760160332&pid=S0074-02762016001000655&pdf_path=mioc/v111n10/0074-0276-mioc-0074-02760160332.pdf&lang=en>Citation: Ferreira-de-Brito A, Ribeiro IP, Miranda RM et al.

ZIKV is an arbovirus whose natural vectors during epidemics have been poorly determined. In this study, 1683 mosquitoes collected in the vicinity of ZIKV suspected cases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 2015 to May 2016 were screened for natural infection by using molecular methods. Up to 3 pools of _Aedes aegypti_ were found with the ZIKV genome, 1 of which had only 1 male. This finding supports the occurrence of vertical and/or venereal transmission of ZIKV in _Ae. aegypti_ in nature. None of the examined _Ae. albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ was positive. This is the 1st report of natural infection by ZIKV in mosquitoes in Brazil and other South American countries. So far, _Ae. aegypti_ is the only confirmed vector of ZIKV during the ongoing Pan-American epidemics.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[It has been presumed that _Ae. aegypti_ is the main mosquito vector of ZIKV. This report helps to substantiate that presumption. A small number (26) of _Ae. albopictus_ , a competent ZIKV vector species, was tested and no evidence of ZIKV was found. A larger number (1107) of _Culex quinquefasciatus_ , previously not shown to be a competent ZIKV vector in Brazil, was tested and found negative for ZIKV. Evidence for ZIKV transovarial and venereal transmission needs to be confirmed by laboratory experiments. One hopes that these results will stimulate similar studies in other locations where ZIKV transmission is going on. - Mod.TY][A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8854>.]
