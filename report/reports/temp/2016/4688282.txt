On Tuesday [6 Dec 2016], King County health officials announced that the outbreak had spread beyond Auburn, where it had originated, to Kent, Federal, Way, and Pacific. There are now 3 cases in Kent, and 1 each in Federal Way and Pacific.Health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated, saying that it's the best way to avoid the virus -- and the best way to avoid spreading the virus. Mumps causes flu-like symptoms, but also painful swelling of the face, head, and neck.59 percent of the people who have come down with mumps were immunized. The vaccine is 88 percent effective. Meanwhile, the Auburn School District is being asked to excuse 200 students from school because they are not vaccinated, KING 5 is reporting.Also on Wednesday [7 Dec 2016], the Centers for Disease Control reported that the U.S. is seeing the most mumps cases in a decade. There were almost 3000 cases in 45 states as of 5 Nov [2016], the agency reported.[Byline: Neal McNamara]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Protection from infection following immunization with the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine falls to about 60 per cent for mumps after 10-15 years. Moving the 2nd MMR dose from 3 years old to an older age would leave young children unprotected against measles and rubella, while a 3rd dose of MMR during adolescence might not be cost-effective since the effectiveness of another jab for those already with immunity is uncertain.It is thought there would be very little added protection against measles and rubella and it might shift the burden of disease due to waning vaccine-induced immunity to older age groups. No advice has been offered on whether booster doses during outbreaks would work because evidence is limited. The best solution is to reinforce current policy on encouraging families of un- and undervaccinated children to put that right.Outbreaks of mumps in universities and colleges occur every 3-4 years, and though the highest risk is to completely unvaccinated students, ""it is likely some vaccinated students can catch mumps and pass the infection on to their close contacts without even knowing it"" [Public Health England].Excerpted and edited from <https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/04/rise-mumps-waning-immunity-mmr-vaccine>.A map showing the location of Washington state, United States, can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>. - Mod.LK]******[2] New York: CDCDate: Thu 8 Dec 2016Source: CNY Central [edited]<http://cnycentral.com/news/local/doctors-infection-returns-at-highest-levels-in-a-decade-12-08-2016>Doctors: Mumps outbreak returns at highest levels in a decade-------------------------------------------------------------The Centers for Disease Control [CDC] is tracking nearly 2900 hundred cases in 45 states, including New York.The last time they fielded this many reports of infection was 2006.Doctors in the Capital Region [Albany, New York] are keeping a close eye on the numbers.""We feel like this minor outbreak of mumps isn't because of any heinous issue like people refusing immunizations or some contagion happening in some part of the world. What happens is, every couple of years, there's outbreaks in closely knit corners like college campuses, and there's a rise in the mumps,"" explained Dr. Jim Saperstone, a pediatrician in the Albany area.The CDC says much of the outbreak comes from college campuses.The SUNY [State University of New York] system knows of 43 cases right now. 37 of them came from SUNY New Paltz. A spokesperson says all of those patients were immunized -- and all were isolated.""You can't prevent it. Like more contagious diseases, you're more contagious days before you know you have it. So you could be walking around and spreading it and not even know it,"" Saperstone said.The telltale signs of mumps are the puffy cheeks and salivary glands, along with a fever and discomfort. Doctors say the symptoms last for a couple of weeks.Mumps can be spread through:- Coughing, sneezing or talking- Sharing items like cups or eating utensils- Touching objects with unwashed hands, which other people then touchIf you start to see any swelling, or have any questions, call your doctor.Late this evening [7 Dec 2016], New York's Department of Health provided this statement: ""The NYSDOH continues to provide technical assistance and guidance to local health departments and colleges in response to cases and outbreaks of mumps as they are reported. In settings in which outbreaks have been declared, the Department is recommending that colleges exclude individuals who have not been vaccinated against the mumps, until such time that the outbreak is over. Additionally, the Department has provided measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to local health departments and colleges so they can vaccinate individuals during outbreaks.""[Byline: Cody Holyoke]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of New York state, United States, may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>. - Mod.LK]
