However, it was not clear whether the villagers had consumed cow or buffalo meat. Though cow slaughter is banned in BJP-ruled Jharkhand, villagers often consume the meat of dead cattle.Health officials said samples of blood and body fluid from the affected people have been sent to the Rajendra Institutes of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for confirmation of anthrax.An investigation report by the Jharkhand Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) said the villagers developed symptoms of suspected anthrax within 48 hours of consuming the meat. ""Villagers don't take into consideration that a dead animal killed by a disease can lead to infections, including anthrax. It is just food for them,"" said DSP Simdega chief Dr Adhyan Saran said.In May 2016, 2 persons from Bandarchuwa village in Simdega died, and 11 others were hospitalised in an anthrax outbreak. In October 2014, 7 people of Kuruchedega village died of suspected anthrax, the highest number of human casualties in the state.IDSP's Jharkhand officer Praveen Karn said villagers ""consuming meat from animals killed by disease has to be checked."" He said the disease is transmitted from animals to humans when the infected meat is handled by a person. Anthrax spores buried in the ground remain dormant for a long time and reactivate when they find a host, in this case, animals that consume grass,"" he said.The Simdega district administration deputed a team from the animal husbandry department to look into vaccination of domesticated animals against anthrax. Dr Rana Pratap, Simdega district veterinary officer, said: ""The animals will be administered anthrax vaccines. It creates antibodies to fight the bacteria. The effect of the vaccine remains for a year and has to be re-administered.""[Byline: Anbwesh Roy Choudhury]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a map of India showing Jharkhand state to the immediate west of West Bengal in NE India, go to: <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg>. Jharkhand was carved out of the southern half of Bihar State in 2000; see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand>.Yet again, we see a back-to-front response. If the Animal Husbandry Department had been doing its job, these cattle would have been vaccinated, therefore protecting the human population from any chance of being exposed to _B. anthracis_. It is very expensive to wait for human cases and deaths before getting your boots on. And ""awareness"" is one thing, but proactive livestock vaccination is more cost effective in preventing any human cases of anthrax than any other action. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306>.]
