This brings to a total of 4 the number of prefectures in which IOM is currently implementing the CEBS activities, after the Boke, Forecariah and Dubreka Prefectures.""The CEBS system is one of the top priorities for the Post-Ebola phase in the Reinforcement of Health Surveillance strategy, elaborated by the Government of Guinea and the National Coordination for the Fight against Ebola,"" said Kabla Amihere, IOM Guinea chief of mission. ""The objective is to involve the community members in identifying and reporting any suspected cases of Ebola and other epidemic diseases to the competent authorities,"" he added.In setting up a functional CEBS system, IOM succeeded in training and equipping community volunteers and community health agents who notify health professionals of any outbreaks of health epidemics within their communities. The health professionals in turn channel the information to the appropriate authorities who then respond accordingly.""Until now, IOM has trained and provided equipment including mobile phones, bags and bicycles to over 880 community health workers and 97 health posts and centers in four prefectures of Guinea,"" said Amihere. He added that by the end of June, 8 more prefectures will be covered by the CEBS activities. A total of 3729 community health workers will be equipped and trained and 293 health posts and health centers, particularly in the border areas will also receive some equipment.IOM is one of 10 partners that support the National Coordination for the Fight against Ebola (NCFB) and the Ministry of Health in implementing the Community Event-Based Surveillance. This program is part of the Health and Humanitarian Border Mobility Management (HBMM) strategy of IOM Guinea, supported by OFDA, CDC and the Government of Japan.Since the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in March 2014, IOM Guinea has been providing logistical support to the Guinean Government through the National/Prefectural Emergency Operations Center Project (PEOC). During the crisis, IOM brought technical support to the NCFB by setting-up health control check-points at borders as well as some major highways for health screening and monitoring of travelers at border points of entry.From March 2015 to May 2016, Guinea has recorded 3812 confirmed, probable and suspected EVD cases, including 2543 deaths, indicating a death rate of 66.7 per cent.]Vaccine-------25 May 2016: Russian Ebola vaccine passes 1st phase of clinical tests on 60 volunteers<http://sputniknews.com/world/20160525/1040206695/russia-ebola-vaccine.html>[The Russian vaccine against Ebola has passed the 1st phase of clinical tests on 60 volunteers and has proven its effectiveness. According to Anna Popova, the vaccine proved to be highly effective with a 100 per cent [effectiveness] after 2 inoculations.In March 2016, Russia claimed it obtained the legal basis to test a recently developed Ebola virus vaccine.

Scientists are concerned the monkeys' behavior could lead to the transmission of deadly diseases, including [Ebola virus disease (EVD)], between species.2 of the monkeys in Tanzania and Kenya were filmed and photographed stripping the flesh off 2 different species of bats, spending between 10 minutes and 1 hour on a single meal. Scientists believe this is the 1st time in recorded history this kind of behavior has ever been filmed.Researchers from FAU observed the activity of guenons, or cercopithecus monkeys, in the wilderness of the Gombe National Park in Tanzania.][The video is available at the URL above. - Mod.LK][compiled by Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--communicated byProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.MapsGuinea: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Tanzania and Kenya: <http://bigblue1840-1940.blogspot.com/2013/05/StampsofKenyaUgandaTanganyika.html>- Mods.LK/JW][See Also:Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.3908196].................................................lk/je/sh"
