Please see Public Health Agency of Canada's Pathogen Safety Data Sheet - Infectious Substances below.""Reservoir: Cyclospora has been found in domestic animals Footnote 1, feces of chicken (oocysts) Footnote 1, and the intestines of mammals and birds Footnote 2. Cyclospora-like oocysts have also been found in zoo animals (nonhuman primates, carnivores, and artiodactyla) Footnote 1.""Public Health Agency of Canada: Pathogen Safety Data Sheet - Infectious Substances <http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/psds-ftss/cyclospora-eng.php>James PusavatAmerican Society for Microbiology, DivC co-moderator<http://www.asm.org/division/c/divcnet.htm><jpusavat@gmail.com>[We are thankful to Professor Frankel for pointing out the error in the name -- my fault; this has already been corrected in the referred post. We are also thankful to Dr Pusavat for pointing out that _Cyclospora_ spp. have animal host reservoirs and providing the link to the cyclospora data sheet from the Public Health Agency of Canada.A review of _Cyclospora_ spp. [Ortega YR, Sanchez R. Update on _Cyclospora cayetanensis_, a food-borne and waterborne parasite. Clinical Microbiology Reviews 2010;23:218-34] states that ""Thus far, _C. cayetanensis_ infections have been identified only in humans. The role of other animal species as reservoirs or intermediary hosts has been examined, with conflicting results."" Thus the finding of cyclospora in other species than humans needs further investigation to see whether it is indeed _C. cayetanensis_ or other cyclospora. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.][See Also:Cyclosporiasis - USA: (TX) alert: 20160807.4399338Cyclosporiasis - UK (02): ex Mexico (Riviera Maya) alert: 20160805.4396881Cyclosporiasis - UK: ex Mexico 20160730.43816652015---Cyclosporiasis - UK, Canada: ex Mexico, RFI 20151101.3759380Cyclosporiasis - USA (05): ex Mexico 20150827.3606898Cyclosporiasis - USA (04): ex Mexico 20150813.3576519Cyclosporiasis - Canada 20150810.3569701Cyclosporiasis - USA (03) 20150802.3553403Cyclosporiasis - USA (02): (TX) 20150702.3479116Cyclosporiasis - USA: (TX) increase in cases 20150624.34624212014---Cyclosporiasis - USA (02): multistate 20140730.2646220Cyclosporiasis - USA: (TX) 20140727.26382192013---Cyclosporiasis - USA (14) 20130906.19269832011---Cyclosporiasis - USA (02): background 20111002.29672005---Cyclosporiasis - USA (FL)(03) 20050604.15642004---Cyclosporiasis - USA (PA) 20040918.25841999---Cyclosporiasis - USA (Missouri) 19990907.15741997---Cyclosporiasis, basil - USA (Washington D.C.)
