Three are hospitalized, and 2 others were hospitalized and have recovered. The patients are all over the age of 50 years.Legionnaires' disease is spread by inhaling the fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_ bacteria. It is not spread person-to-person, and a person cannot get it by consuming water. Outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been linked to cooling towers (air-conditioning units for large buildings), cooling misters, decorative fountains or plumbing systems.Minnesota typically sees 50 to 60 cases of legionellosis each year. More than 60 cases have been reported in the state so far this year [2016], mirroring a national increase in cases in 2016. No other clusters have been reported in Minnesota this year.Most people exposed to _Legionella_ don't develop Legionnaires' disease. People over the age of 50, smokers, or those with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or other chronic health conditions, are at increased risk for Legionnaires' disease. Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include muscle aches, chills, shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite and coughing. These symptoms may be followed by high fever (102-105 F [38-40 C]), pneumonia and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhea. If you have concerns, please seek medical attention.More information on Legionnaires' disease is on the MDH website at About Legionellosis (_Legionella_).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The 5 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease are said to all live or work in Hopkins, Minnesota. Hopkins, with a population of 17 591 in 2010, is a suburban city located in Hennepin County, 3 miles west of the city of Minneapolis; Hopkins is about 4 square miles in size and is about 98% developed, with little remaining vacant land (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins,_Minnesota>).Genotyping the isolates of _Legionella_ will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak.Although inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_ is the most common mechanism for disease transmission, some patients who are prone to aspiration, for example, the debilitated elderly, may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration _Legionella_-contaminated potable water (1-3). Aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated water is also the obvious source for neonatal Legionnaires' disease that has occurred following use of _Legionella_-contaminated home birthing pools (4-6).References:1.
