WHO Yellow Fever Situation Report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/yellowfeversitrep7Oct16-eng.pdf>Yellow fever - situation report-------------------------------Key updatesAngola epidemiological update (as of 29 Sep [2016]):- The last confirmed case had symptom onset on 23 Jun [2016].- 32 probable cases were reported in the last 4 weeks.- Phase II of the vaccination campaign was postponed due to logistical challenges but was rescheduled to begin the 2nd week of October. The target population consists of 2 million people in 12 districts in 9 provinces.Democratic Republic of The Congo (DRC) epidemiological update (as of 5 Oct [2016]):- The last confirmed non-sylvatic case had symptom onset on 12 Jul [2016].- 7 cases are under investigation (3 in Kinshasa and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, Sud Ubangi and Tshuapa provinces).- The reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi and Mushenge Health Zones in Kwango province began on 2 and 6 Oct [2016], respectively.AnalysisThe continuing detection and investigation of suspected and laboratory-positive cases (including the 32 probable cases in Angola) demonstrate that active surveillance is ongoing. Nevertheless, it is important to note persistent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation capacities, which may delay case detection. A strong and sustained surveillance effort remains crucial.The status of the probable cases in Angola will be reviewed by the Ministry of Health's Final Classification Committee once the investigations are completed as to their exposure history and yellow fever vaccination status.Epidemiological situationAngola32 probable cases were reported in the last 4 weeks.From 5 Dec 2015 - 29 Sep 2016 (Fig. 1, Table 1):- 4188 suspected cases, with 373 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 8.9 percent);- 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 percent).Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces (Table 2).Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces.Luanda and Huambo provinces have reported the highest number of total cases. As of 29 Sep [2016], 2097 (50 percent of all reported cases) cases including 488 confirmed cases have been reported in Luanda and 651 (16 percent of all reported cases) cases including 128 confirmed cases have been reported in Huambo.Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)From 1 Jan - 5 Oct 2016 (Fig. 2, Table 1):- 2870 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces;- 76 confirmed cases have been identified from 2473 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 percent);- Of the 76 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces (Fig. 4), 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous 1 , and 6 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak).7 cases are under investigation (3 in Kinshasa and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, Sud Ubangi and Tshuapa provinces).ResponseInformation on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website.In DRC, the 10 day reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi and Mushenge Health Zones in Kwango province began on 2 and 6 October, respectively. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted in August [2016].WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to Angola, DRC and Angola through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile, with additional vaccine doses from the manufacturer Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.As of 6 Oct 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for DRC (Table 3).The number of vaccine doses currently available in the ICG global stockpile for emergency response is 8.8 million (Table 4). The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not surprising to learn that a few new cases of yellow fever are popping up, given the wide geographic area in which the outbreak has occurred in the 2 countries. As this report notes, the continuing detection and investigation of suspected and laboratory-positive cases (including the 32 probable cases in Angola) demonstrate that active surveillance is ongoing. It is important to have these suspected cases tested to know if they are YF cases or can be discarded. It is of concern to note persistent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation are occurring. It is essential to detect new cases promptly through vigorous surveillance and have them laboratory confirmed so that timely responses can be implemented. The rainy season underway may make access to more remote areas difficult.This report has several useful graphs, tables and maps.
