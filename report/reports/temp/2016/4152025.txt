One person, who was severely affected, has been admitted to Koraput Hospital while others have been treated in the villages.According to sources, 50 villagers had consumed beef and later they showed symptoms of anthrax. A medical team, headed by Koraput Additional Medical Officer Arun Padhi, rushed to the spot and examined the villagers. Later, the medical team treated 19 villagers who had consumed the contaminated beef. The condition of the severely affected person is stable, sources said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52755>.A map of Odisha state can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/orissa/orissa.htm>.To find Semiliguda in Koraput district, go to <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Similigurha.html>We have had a series of reports of anthrax affecting the tribals in the Semiliguda block (listed below), and this same village, Kankadamaba, was afflicted in late March 2015 (see archive no. 20150330.3265314). It is clear that this block is long overdue for a routine annual vaccination of their cattle and maybe sheep and goats. To prevent human cases of anthrax one must vaccinate their livestock. Vaccinating humans is largely a waste of time unless we are discussing the military, but their exposure as, and when, and if it occurs is different.In rural areas in economically challenged areas there are various degrees of malnutrition and therefore as meat is infrequently consumed there is a great temptation to butcher moribund and dead livestock. And when they have died from anthrax, the butchering team and all those handling the meat are exposed to cutaneous anthrax, and anyone eating that meat to enteric anthrax. Sterne vaccine is one of the cheapest vaccines in the world and most effective, so vaccinating these people's livestock will prevent livestock cases and thus human cases. It is highly cost-effective. - Mod.MHJ]
