At the same time, the European Medicines Agency granted the vaccine Prime status, which refers to a treatment targeting an unmet medical need.In addition, Merck looks to gather data from 3 separate clinical trials: one in New Guinea, one led by the National Institutes of Health [NIH] in Sierra Leone, and one in Liberia led by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], and submit the information later this year [2016] to regulators in hopes of winning approval to market and distribute its vaccine by the end of 2017. Last year [2015], interim results from the study being conducted in New Guinea showed that the Merck vaccine (referred to as both VSV ZEBOV and V920) demonstrated the ability to cut the risk of infection in people. GlaxoSmithKline is also running a late-stage test to determine whether its own vaccine is effective against Ebola.26 Jul 2016: Scientists discover modified human protein involved in Ebola virus replication<http://www.news-medical.net/news/20160726/Scientists-discover-modified-human-protein-involved-in-Ebola-virus-replication.aspx>Citation.

Ebolavirus (EBOV) is an RNA virus that is known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates. EBOV successfully enters and replicates in many cell types. This replication is dependent on the virus successfully coopting a number of cellular factors. Many of these factors are currently unidentified but represent potential targets for antiviral therapeutics. Here we show that cellular polyamines are critical for EBOV replication. We found that small-molecule inhibitors of polyamine synthesis block gene expression driven by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ... -more]30 Jul 2016: After Phase-3 disaster, NewLink Genetics plots reorganization [focus turns to Ebola]<http://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/after-phiii-disaster-newlink-genetics-plots-reorganization>[The company is undergoing an overhaul, including changing its focus onto its late-stage Merck Ebola vaccine collaboration, and other research and development programs, including a checkpoint inhibitor program with Roche's Genetech.]30 Jul 2016: Analysis of Ebola virus polymerase domains to find strain-specific differences and to gain insight on their pathogenicity<http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13337-016-0334-8>Citation.Patel S & Patel S. Analysis of Ebola virus polymerase domains to find strain-specific differences and to gain insight on their pathogenicity. Virus Dis (30 Jul 2016). doi:10.1007/s13337-016-0334-8Abstract.Ebola virus, a member of the family _Filoviridae_, has caused immense morbidity and mortality in recent times, especially in West Africa. The infection characterized by chills, fever, diarrhea, and myalgia can progress to hemorrhage and death. Hence, it is a high-priority area to better understand its biology in order to expedite vaccine development pipelines. In this regard, this study analyzes the domains in RNA polymerase of 15 publicly-available Ebola isolates belonging to 3 strains (Zaire, Sudan and Reston). The protein FASTA sequences of the isolates belonging to Zaire, Sudan and Reston strains were extracted from UniProt database and submitted to the interactive web tool SMART for the polymerase domain profiles. Subsequent in silico investigation furnished interesting results that surely can contribute to the understanding of Ebola pathogenesis. The key findings and patterns have been presented and, based on them hypotheses, have been formulated for further empirical validation.******[3] Miscellaneous31 Jul 2016 UK: Ebola nurse speaks of her stress at unresolved misconduct allegations<http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ebola-nurse-pauline-cafferkey-speaks-8532838#YY5hhSRmqvwKr14z.99>[""Ebola nurse, ""PC,"" has spoken of her stress over misconduct allegations, which remain unresolved more than 18 months on from her return to the [United Kingdom (UK)] with the virus. In the meantime, PC has been denied the GBP 4000 [USD 5300] bonus that other health-care workers who served beside PC have been paid. ""PC"" was infected while working with the sick in Sierra Leone in December 2014, at the height of the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] epidemic.She flew back to the UK that month and spent almost a month being treated in an isolation unit at London's Royal Free Hospital. She made a recovery but was readmitted to the hospital twice after suffering complications linked to the disease, at one stage falling critically ill with neurological issues, including EVD-caused meningitis.""PC"" states she would like to have this very-stressful issue resolved.][Here is a nurse who volunteered to help during the 2014 Ebola outbreak at a time of great need, and who has been left with permanent physical problems as a result of infection with the virus, who is being put in a position of further stress. The misconduct allegations should be resolved as soon as possible to allow her to get on with her life. - Mod.LK][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.HealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>- Mod.LK][See Also:Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.3908196].................................................lk/msp/lm"
