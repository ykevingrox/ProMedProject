Suzak is right on the border with Uzbekistan; see <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KG/03/Suzak.html>.The Fergana valley is rife with livestock anthrax so this person could have gotten infected from one of their own animals that died and was butchered, or from Uzbek meat they bought in the market. Without a coordinated vaccination control program between the 2 countries in this region, we will continue to see outbreaks there. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2058>.]
