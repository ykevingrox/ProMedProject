Pakistan Today [edited]<http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/05/21/city/karachi/anti-measles-vaccination-campaign-postponed-in-city/>Anti-measles vaccination campaign, which was scheduled to begin on Wed May 25 2016, has been postponed in Karachi.Reliable sources at the health department told PPI that an expanded program on immunization (EPI) had decided to carry out a special vaccination drive in 120 high risk union councils of Karachi from 25 May to 2 Jun [2016] to contain measles outbreak in the city. They planned to vaccinate around 1.1 million children between the ages of 6 months to 5 years in 120 high risk union councils of Karachi.The decision was taken after reporting of over 500 measles cases from different districts of Karachi. The special measles vaccination drive had been planned to be carried out in union councils where sanitation conditions are extremely poor and the rate of routine immunization is very low. Sources said the drive had been postponed due to polio drive which was expected to start from May 23 in the city. New date will be announced soon.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Karachi is the largest and most populous metropolitan city in the world and is the capital of Sindh province of Pakistan.

Currently all confirmed cases are from the Kerikeri/Whangaroa area.Dr Clair Mills, medical officer of health at Northland DHB, advises Northlanders to ensure their families are protected from measles. ""This is an avoidable disease where there is an effective vaccine. Immunization protects not only the individual, but also stops the spread of this disease within our communities. Please double-check that you and your child are not at risk. There is a window of opportunity now to catch up on any missed vaccinations. Vaccination is a much better option than having a very sick child at home for a couple of weeks, or having your teenager miss 2 weeks of school.""Vaccination clinics were held over the weekend in Kerikeri and further clinics planned for this week.Measles is spread by tiny droplets in the air and is very infectious, easily spreading to those nearby. The first symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes) can be mistaken for a cold, with the rash (appearing on the face and neck and spreading over the body) 3 to 5 days later.Dr Mills says anyone displaying symptoms of measles, which include fever, cough, runny nose, sore red eyes, followed by a rash spreading from the head and neck over the body, should immediately telephone their doctor or one of our public health nurses.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Northland Region is the northernmost of New Zealand's 16 local government regions.

From 1 Jan to 21 May [2016], there have been a total of 50 reported measles cases, about 3 times more than the 17 cases in 2015 during the same period, the MOH said.Of the cases reported this year, 40 of them involved Singaporean patients and 34 of these were children, said the MOH. A total of 17 of these children were under the age of 1 year, and were not yet due for their first measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. MOH added that 14 were children between the ages of 1 and 6 [years] who had missed their MMR vaccinations and 3 were 1 year olds who had received only their 1st MMR vaccination.Under the Infectious Diseases Act, MMR vaccinations are compulsory for children in Singapore. The 1st dose should be given when the child is 12 months old, and the 2nd dose between the age of 15 and 18 months. Both doses are needed for the vaccination to give lifelong protection against MMR. The MOH said it is important that young children receive both doses of the vaccination on time, and preschool children who miss either or both doses should be vaccinated without delay.The MOH said that vaccination is the best preventive measure against measles, which is a highly infectious disease spread through air droplets and direct contact with nasal and throat secretions. It added that a patient could already be infectious even before symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and rashes set in.""The MOH reminds parents that measles vaccination is compulsory and they should bring their children for vaccination if they have not done so, or missed the vaccination schedule,"" it added. Apart from children, the Health Ministry advised other family members who have not been vaccinated to do so, especially if there is a baby being cared for at home. As with children, adults who have not been previously vaccinated should receive 2 doses, while those who have received only 1 dose should receive the 2nd as well.The MMR vaccination is available at polyclinics, private general practitioner clinics and private pediatric clinics, and is fully subsidized for Singapore citizens at polyclinics. Singaporeans can also use their Medisave to cover the cost of the vaccination at private clinics, the MOH added.The Health Ministry said the National Immunization Registry at the Health Promotion Board routinely sends out reminder letters to all children who have not had their measles vaccinations by the age of 2. School health services provide the vaccine to Primary One students who did not receive the 2nd dose in their preschool years.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It looks like Singapore has implemented an excellent vaccination program, but cannot protect those children who are under 1 year old prior to the 1st MMR vaccination.

The ministry of health said this represents 100 per cent coverage.The campaign received a Sh1.2 billion (USD 12 332 399) grant from Global Alliance for Vaccine Initiative (Gavi) to vaccinate 18 972 922 children. The campaign started on 16 May 2016 with the national launch in Narok County.Head of immunization Dr Ephantus Maree says that there were few cases of mild to moderate adverse effects reported following the exercise and ""are still going through investigation"". He however says that there are no severe or fatal cases reported. ""By day 9 on 24 May 2016, we had vaccinated 488 479 (72 per cent) women of reproductive age in the 11 participating counties,"" says Dr Maree.Children got double immunity against measles and rubella in the jabs of the new combined vaccine that is set to be introduced into the routine schedule of immunization. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that countries should conduct a wide age range campaign with MR vaccine, 6 months prior to its adoption into the routine.Dr Maree said Kenya plans to introduce MR vaccine into routine immunization come January 2017 and hence the importance of the just-concluded MR campaign. ""This was after Kenya National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (KENITAG) recommended replacement of measles vaccine for routine immunization with measles-rubella at 9 and 18 months,"" Dr Maree said.He said the measles-rubella supplementary immunization activities were in line with the global measles-rubella elimination strategic plan 2012-2030. ""The implementation of this activity involved more than 42 000 health workers and 24 000 volunteers across all the counties of Kenya,"" Dr Maree said.According to Dr Maree, some of the challenges experienced during the vaccination include; late arrival of syringes and safety boxes due to logistics, resistance against vaccination especially from the Catholic Church and Legio Maria and heavy rains.[byline: Elizabeth Merab, Stella Cherono]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Legio Maria was legally registered in Kenya in 1966 as a church, expanded massively in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and eventually spread to many countries in Africa, including Uganda, Tanzania, Congo, Zaire, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Nigeria. -- from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_Maria>.From this report, it appears the vaccine does not include mumps virus, but rather measles and rubella.A map of Kenya may be accessed at <http://bit.ly/1Ug1527>.The reader is referred to previous ProMED posts listed below for commentary on the infectiousness of measles and the need for the full 2 dose vaccination regimen. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150>.]
