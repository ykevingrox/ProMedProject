Almeida Chitungo indicated that the suspected cases are Huambo residents, but were visiting the Viana municipality in Luanda where many cases have been registered. The official stated that the suspected cases were immediately sent to the Huambo Central Hospital and isolated from mosquitoes so as not to spread the virus to other patients.Almeida Chitungo appealed to the population to redouble care with water [containers], clean up puddles, use bed nets among other measures to avoid the disease, guaranteeing, however, that routine vaccinations will be intensified for children [older than] 9 months.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The YF outbreak that was 1st recognized in Viana municipality in Luanda may be spreading. YF cases have been reported in the municipality of Caluquembe, located in southern Huila province and nearly 1000 km [620 miles] from the Luanda outbreak. There are 2 suspected YF cases with 1 death identified in patients admitted to the Municipal Hospital of Amboim, coastal Cuanza [Kwanza] Sul province, the head of Provincial Department of Public Health, Maria Lussinga, said Mon 1 Feb 2016. Now, we have 4 new suspected cases who became ill in Huambo but were infected in Viana. ProMED would be interested in information about any additional cases and in the laboratory results. If these suspected cases are confirmed, the situation is worrisome because it indicates rapid spread to new geographic areas in Angola. Increased surveillance with rapid laboratory support as well as vigorous action including vaccination and vector control are necessary to bring the outbreak in these affected localities under control before they spread further. In YF outbreaks, time and inaction are the enemies. The above report indicates that vaccination efforts will be intensified for children, but no mention is made about the vaccination status of the rest of the population.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>; of Viana in relation to Luanda at <http://becoangola.com/imagens/viana.gif>; and a map showing the provinces of Angola at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/angola/angola-political-map.html>. - Mod.TY]
