He was part of a group of 3 French people having recently travelled in East Greenland. Between [13 and 16 Feb 2016] they each had consumed around 200 g of polar bear (_Ursus maritimus_) meat. The polar bear meat had been cut into 1 cm thick slices and then fried for several minutes, but was still pink when eaten. One of the consumers, aged 56, was totally asymptomatic besides one day of pronounced diarrhea at the beginning of March. On [9 Mar 2016] the last consumer, aged 59, developed fever, myalgia and a slight facial edema and one day of diarrhea. Blood tests were performed on all the patients and showed both elevated muscle enzyme and eosinophile levels. Antibody testing for _Trichinella_ was positive by ELISA and western blot for the 3 patients (LDBio Diagnostics, France) and they were prescribed albendazole for 10-days. The polar bear, weighing around 400 kg, was shot by a local accredited Inuit hunter in the Scorebysund region on the East coast of Greenland (figure 1 and 2). Only the 3 French travellers ate under-cooked meat, whereas local people ate the meat boiled and have been informed that the polar bear was infected with _Trichinella_. None of the meat was imported to France. Trichinellosis is well known in Greenland, where large human outbreaks were reported during the 40s and the 50s, but since then only sporadic human cases have been documented (MÌüller, 2007). In Ammassalik, 800 km [about 500 miles] south of Scoresbysund, high seroprevalences (around 20 percent) of trichinellosis were found in humans (MÌüller, 2007). In this specific region Kapel et al (1995) found a 35 percent prevalence of trichinellosis in arctic fox (_Alopex lagopus_) and mentioned 32 to 41 percent prevalence of trichinellosis in polar bears. Bear meat is a frequent source of trichinellosis in French people travelling in the Arctic, as 31 cases (including these 3 cases) have been reported in France since 1995. Two cases were described in 1996 in 2 aircraft pilots who stopped for a few hours in Greenland and ate polar bear steaks (Nozais et al, 1996). We reported one case in 2004 and 17 cases in 2005 after consumption of black bear (_Ursus americanus_) meat hunted in the George River region in North Quebec (Ancelle et al, 2005). We also reported 8 cases in crews of 2 boats sailing through the NW passage and who had eaten grizzly bear (_Ursus arctos_) meat in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut (HouzÌ© et al, 2009). Travellers in these regions have to be warned of the risk of eating raw meats such as bear or walrus meat that can be source of trichinellosis; a parasitose that can be severe and complicated by potentially lethal myocarditis or encephalitis.References:Ancelle T, De Bruyne A, Poisson D, Dupouy-Camet J.

Apparently these travellers had not planned to eat half-cooked polar bear meat before travelling and had not obtained pre-travel advice on the risk of _Trichinella_ from such meat.Similar infection from eating meat from a brown bear shot in Canada was reported in 2005 and 2009 also in French travellers (see below).The most recent study of trichinellosis in the Inuit population of East Greenland, where the bear in this study was shot, found a seroprevalence of 1.4 percent in persons below 40 years increasing to 12 percent in persons over 60 years, indicating that the habit of eating raw or undercooked meat from polar bear, walrus and seals has decreased (Trichinella infection in a hunting community in East Greenland.
