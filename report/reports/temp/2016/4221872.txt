It's unclear whether the person was vaccinated.Massachusetts Public Health Department released a list of where the infected individual went between 1 May and 8 May [2016], and consider the possible exposure locations [included at source URL above].Measles symptoms typically appear up to 2 weeks after exposure. Symptoms include a cold with fever, cough, red eyes, and a rash that lasts a few days moves down the body.Officials recommend anyone who may have visited the locations during the outlined time to call their local health department.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[From the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services (<http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/newsroom/press-releases/dph/confirmed-case-of-measles-announced.html>):""Early symptoms of measles occur 10 days to 2 weeks after exposure and may resemble a cold with fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, but a rash occurs on the skin 2-4 days after the initial symptoms develop. The rash usually appears 1st on the head and moves downward. The rash typically lasts a few days and then disappears in the same order. People with measles may be contagious up to 4 days before and for 4 days after the day the rash appears. People who have had measles in the past or who have been vaccinated against measles per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations are considered immune.""Those who think they may have been exposed to measles should immediately confirm that they have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have laboratory evidence of immunity to measles. Those without immunity to measles should contact their healthcare provider to get a dose of MMR vaccine as soon as possible. People born in the US before 1957 are unlikely to be susceptible to measles, but may consider getting a dose of vaccine. Young infants, pregnant women, and those with severe immunocompromising health conditions who may have been exposed are at particular risk and should contact their healthcare providers as soon as possible. A medicine called immune globulin may be given to help modify measles. Those who are unable to get vaccinated and have no other proof of immunity may need to refrain from all public activities for up to 21 days after the exposure to avoid spreading the infection.""'People who have been exposed to measles who develop fever, cold symptoms and rash should call their healthcare provider immediately, before going in for a medical appointment, to make sure they can be evaluated without exposing others. Fortunately in Massachusetts we have very high rates of MMR vaccination, especially among school-age youth,' said Dr. Monica Bharel, Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. 'If you have been exposed to measles, be on the alert for 21 days after exposure, to watch for symptoms of respiratory illness with fever, followed by a rash.'"" - Mod.LKA map of Massachusetts in the USA may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/224>.]******[2] Measles: Ireland (Kerry, Dublin)Date: Thu 12 May 2016Source: Today FM [edited]<http://www.todayfm.com/Confirmed-case-of-Measles>Confirmed case of measles-------------------------The HSE [Health Service Executive] says it's investigating a confirmed case of measles in someone who spends time in Dublin and Kerry. All known contacts have been notified.But the HSE says anyone who hasn't had measles or 2 doses of the MMR [vaccine] and may have been in Dublin and Kerry in the week up to and including the May Bank Holiday [2 May 2016] may be at risk.Measles is highly infectious and is spread easily, and the Executive says there's a high chance that individuals who have not been fully vaccinated will develop measles if they are exposed.If anyone has symptoms, which include irritability, a runny nose and fever -- they're asked to stay at home and phone their GP.Measles has almost been eradicated from Ireland, but is highly infectious.There are only a handful of cases each year, and so far in 2016 there have been 2 cases.[Byline: Susan Keogh] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Measles: Ireland close to eliminationDate: Sat 14 May 2016Source: Irish Examiner [edited]<http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/measles-close-to-elimination-from-ireland-399443.html>Measles 'close to' elimination from Ireland-------------------------------------------Ireland is ""very close"" to eliminating measles, HSE consultant in public health Kevin Kelleher said yesterday [13 May 2016].Dr Kelleher said a teenager who had contracted the disease was fine and all known relevant contacts with the person had been notified and advised of the risk.""We are being very cautious in this instance because measles is potentially a serious condition,"" he said.""We are currently very close to eliminating measles here in Ireland."" Kelleher said most people had nothing to worry about because the vast majority of the population have been fully vaccinated.He said the teenager, who had started to become ill around the May bank holiday weekend [30 Apr to 2 May 2016], had been in Dublin and Kerry.Because it is not possible to accurately identify all those likely to have been exposed, the HSE wanted to highlight the signs and symptoms of the disease.Measles is a highly infectious illness and spreads easily. Babies under 12 months are most at risk because they cannot have the vaccine.People at risk of measles are those who did not have the virus in the past or did not receive 2 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.Dr Kelleher said control of measles in Ireland had been very successful and said most of the recent cases could be linked to people coming from outside the country with measles.There had been an outbreak of measles in north Dublin in 2011 but, since then, the number of cases had fallen.""There are only a handful of cases each year and, so far in 2016, there have been 2 cases. Ireland is striving to eliminate measles entirely and prevent onward transmission,"" he said.Dr Kelleher said anyone with measles should stay at home, take paracetamol, rest, and drink lots of fluid. They should also phone their GP and explain that they may be at risk of measles.More than 60 cases of measles were reported in London earlier this year [2016], a period when there would usually be fewer than 10.Measles fact file-----------------Measles is an acute and severe viral infection, with a rash usually appearing about 4 days after early symptoms that include a cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, and high fever.The rash typically starts on the forehead and spreads downwards, over the face, neck, and body.The rash consists of flat red or brown blotches that can flow into each other.It lasts for about 4 to 7 days. Symptoms may include diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.[Byline: Evelyn Ring]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Ireland can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39>.]
