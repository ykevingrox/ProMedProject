KUOW, NWNews [edited]<http://kuow.org/post/cdc-helps-state-test-valley-fever-eastern-washington-soil>The emergence of 9 cases of a fungal infection known as valley fever in southeast Washington over the last 5 years has state and federal health officials concerned. This week, the state and the CDC are launching a USD 50 000 study.Valley fever, also called coccidioidomycosis, is caused by microscopic fungus spores, dusted up from desert soil. It can act a lot like the flu causing some to develop serious lung or nervous system problems. People who often work outdoors in the dust are at greater risk of catching the disease.Valley fever is more common in California and the southwest, but now, Hover Park, outside the Tri-Cities, has repeatedly tested positive for it. The park is popular with ATV [all-terrain vehicle] riders and 4-wheelers.Scientists are sampling it this week with full protective gear and respirators. The study spans from the Yakima Valley clear to Asotin, just across the Snake River from Idaho.[Byline: Anna King]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the south western United States (mainly the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, but also Nevada, Utah, and now Washington), parts of northern Mexico, and in Central and South America. It is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_ and _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow in the top 2-8 inches (5 to 20 cm) of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. The airborne spores then can travel great distances on currents of air. The airborne spores can be inhaled and produce an acute infection in humans, as well as other animals.ProMED-mail previously reported on the occurrence of coccidioidomycosis in Washington State (ProMED-mail post Coccidioidomycosis - USA: (WA) soil 20140524.2495865). Test results showed that the soil samples were positive for the valley fever fungus, and that these organisms genetically matched samples of the fungus obtained from one of the patients.The Tri-Cities consists of 3 neighboring cities, Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco, with a combined population of the 3 major cities of 193 567, located at the confluence of the Yakima, Snake, and Columbia rivers in the semi-arid, southeastern region of the US state of Washington. Due to the semi-arid climate and large amount of sand that is favorable for _C. immitis_ growth, dust is blown about by the frequent winds that can periodically exceed 30 mph (48 km/h) (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-Cities,_Washington#Climate_and_geography>). Hover Park is located on the Columbia River, southeast of Kennewick.
