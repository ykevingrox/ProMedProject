But, before the veterinary officials started vaccination, 7 more cattle fell prey to the mysterious disease. S Kuruviah, Assistant Director of the Animal Disease Analyzing Unit, refuted the charge and said that as soon as the officials were informed of the cattle deaths, they had collected smear samples from the carcasses. According to Kuruviah, only 8 cattle have died. When contacted, K Thangarasu, of the unit, said it was common for anthrax to spread in areas where domestic animals had been affected by the disease once as, unless destroyed carefully, anthrax spores were capable of living for more than 3 decades.On Tuesday [5 Jan 2016], as many as 8 villagers who ate the meat of an anthrax-affected cow were admitted to the Mundiyambakkam Government Medical College and Hospital after they developed high fever and rashes on their bodies.P Vasanthamani, Dean of the Medical College Hospital, said only medical reports could confirm if the villagers were affected by anthrax. It could be a simple skin allergy too, she said. The patients admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital told Express that they had eaten the meat of the cow, unaware that it had died of anthrax.When his cow died a week ago mysteriously, [the owner] sought the help of these 8 men to slaughter the dead cow. After slaughtering the cow, they took the meat home and ate it with their family members. As days passed, the 8 fell sick. Panic gripped the villagers when minor rashes appeared on their limbs and other body parts. When rushed to the Alathur PHC, they were referred to the medical college hospital.[Byline: Karal Marx L]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Couldn't ask for a better account of what happens when a cow dies unexpectedly of anthrax, and it gets butchered faster than the informed authorities can respond. There would have been enough blood spilt on the ground to satisfy the curiosity of other cows in the village. And so you have multiple cows and humans affected. The only way to prevent this is to proactively vaccinate livestock in areas of the state where there have been previous outbreaks in the last 5 or so years. And repeat annually until there have been no further outbreaks for at least 5 years. In the past there have been multiple reports of human anthrax in relation to exposure to caprine cases, and tanneries.Villupuram in the largest district in Tamil Nadu and is on the NE coast of the state; see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viluppuram>. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/319>.]
