Forever Missed by the Brachman Family [edited]<http://www.forevermissed.com/philipbrachman/#lifestory>Dr Brachman received his medical degree from the University of Wisconsin Medical School in 1953, interned at the University of Illinois Research and Education Hospital in Chicago from 1953 to 1954.Dr Philip Brachman was a legend in public health. He joined the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in 1954, before many of us were even born, and worked there in epidemiology and training until his retirement. He held many positions at CDC including directing the Field Epidemiology Training Program and serving as director of the Epidemiology Program Office from 1970 to 1981.After retiring from CDC in 1986 Phil began a 2nd career, when he joined the Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH), Emory University and taught courses in epidemiology, biostatistics, public health surveillance, and infectious diseases. He also developed a series of short courses that were taught in Atlanta, throughout the United States, and abroad. Philip was also the director of the Hubert H Humphrey Fellowship program that brought countless public health practitioners from all reaches of the globe to Emory each year. Building on his connections with the Centers for AIDS Research [CFAR], Emory was named the ""AIDS Fellows campus"" for the Humphrey Program, thereby gifting our CFAR with some of the best and brightest from all over the world.The Humphrey Fellows revered Philip and appreciated his dedication and enthusiasm for them. He was a passionate educator and leader. When he entered the hospital yesterday morning he lamented that he could not be with his students that day, was concerned about who would replace him, and was looking forward to being back in the classroom tomorrow.As a result of his 62 years as a truly outstanding educator there are thousands of people around the world who are able to help politicians, community leaders, service providers, and public health activists make data-driven public health decisions about everything from AIDS to Zika. The world is, and will remain, a better place because of Phil.

I have fond memories of him as an educator with a passion for expanding field epidemiology outside of the CDC campus, both throughout the USA as well as overseas. He was a strong advocate for the development of the Global EIS program, now known as Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs). He also was a strong advocate for the development and expansion of the EIS alumni network, recognizing the value to public health of such a network. The memories of his championing the commission and production of a history of the EIS, bring a smile -- each year at each alumni association meeting beginning sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s, Phil would be asked about the progress of the EIS history project. And each year it was ""in progress"". In 2010, Phil was delighted when Mark Pendergrast's ""Inside the outbreaks: the elite medical detectives of the Epidemic Intelligence Service"" was published.It was a natural that when Phil retired from CDC he went on to continue his global epidemiology training quest through his work at Emory. The testimonies available on the Forever Missed website from many of the Humphrey Scholars he mentored give a good glimpse of how he continued his work while at Emory.Phil, you will be greatly missed, and fondly remembered, including your ties.--Marjorie P Pollack MD, EIS '77Deputy EditorEpidemiology & Surveillance ModeratorProMED-mail<pollack@promedmail.org>******[4]Date: Wed 8 Jun 2016From: Martin Hugh-JonesWhen I heard of Phil's death, I sent a message to Phil Jr: ""I am very sorry to hear of your dad's death. I have known him personally over many decades. A respected man of insight. The last time I visited with him in his office in Emory he generously shared a number of his personal investigations into various anthrax outbreaks, not just the reports but the miscellaneous documents of interest as well. A truly generous act. May he rest in peace.""His investigations into anthrax outbreaks were significant at the time and very fruitful. It was classic traditional shoe-leather epidemiology.--Martin Hugh-JonesProfessor EmeritusDepartment of Pathobiological SciencesProfessor Emeritus, Department of Environmental StudiesLouisiana State UniversityProMED-mail Animal Health Moderator******[5]Date: Wed 8 Jun 2016From: Ghassan M Matar It is sad news. Yesterday I was at a meeting in the Department of Global Health at Emory and was informed of Philip's passing. I also went over pictures with Eugene Gangarosa and others that were displayed in an area at the entrance of the Department in memory of Philip.May his soul rest in peace.--Ghassan M Matar PhDProfessorDepartment of Experimental Pathology, Immunology & MicrobiologyFaculty of MedicineAmerican University of BeirutBeirut, LebanonProMED-MENA moderator.................................................mpp/gmm/mhj/mpp/je/sh"
