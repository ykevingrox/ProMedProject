BBC [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/health-37729096>""If this is it, what am I going to do with my remaining few months?"" wondered the vet while lying in a hospital bed. He's one of more than 100 000 people who catch tuberculosis from animals each year, an issue the World Health Organization says has been ignored for decades. The brutal infection led to him losing nearly 7.5kg in weight as it settled in his chest.[The vet] was testing stress levels in wildebeest near Kruger National Park in South Africa in 2013 when he thinks he was infected. ""Six weeks later [back in the UK] I remember waking up in the middle of the night and struggling for breath with acute chest pain, then I had horrendous night sweats, literally my pajamas and bed were drenched. As a vet, looking back in hindsight, I should have realised what was happening, but I'd just got a new mattress, and I thought 'this isn't breathing'.""He described himself as fairly fit before the bacterial infection, but even walking the dog up a short hill became a struggle.He was given a course of antibiotics after a GP said he probably had pneumonia. Yet [the vet] developed a really bad fever, and one morning while swimming he could manage only 2 lengths before struggling and having to drag himself out of the pool. At a hospital appointment for an ultrasound, doctors refused to let him leave. ""My right lung was virtually non-existent; they drained 2.5 litres of fluid from my right pleural space [the area around the lungs],"" [the vet] said.He added: ""I knew there was something serious going on, and I started to plan my last few months. ""I started putting together places I wanted to go, I love travelling to see animals. ""I was 32 [years old] at the time; I'd had a pretty fun life and was hoping it was going to be longer!""While he was in hospital he encountered one of the great challenges with animal TB; it is often confused with human TB. Despite the symptoms looking similar, the diseases are caused by different bacteria. Animal TB is caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, while human TB is caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. The Cheltenham-based vet added: ""I was pretty convinced it was animal TB, but the consultant said he was not convinced; it was 3 months later that they realised it was bovine TB. ""With all due respect, they didn't have a clue about it, and they didn't really know what to do with me. They just went through the standard protocol for TB.""Animal or zoonotic TB can be more serious and harder to treat than conventional, human tuberculosis. It is inherently resistant to one of the key drugs used to treat human TB, so using the wrong combination of antibiotics risks the infection developing resistance to the drugs that do work.[The vet] was eventually given the all-clear in November 2014. [But] he warns: ""There needs to be a greater awareness about zoonotic TB. It is getting momentum, and that is a great thing so more research is done and it can be diagnosed and treated more quickly.""How to tackle animal tuberculosis is one of the themes of the Union World Conference on Lung Health taking place this week.[Byline: James Gallagher]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is mostly extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium bovis - USA: (NE) ex Mexico, airborne person-to-person transm 20160310.4083566:_Mycobacterium bovis_ is a member of the ""_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex,"" which is composed of closely related species: _M. tuberculosis_ (the usual cause of tuberculosis in humans), _M. bovis_ (the usual cause of bovine tuberculosis), _M. bovis_-BCG, _M. microti_ (a pathogen in rodents), and _M. canetti_ and _M. africanum_ (both rare causes of tuberculosis in Africa)._M. bovis_ can be distinguished from _M. tuberculosis_ by specific gene probes (the standard nucleic acid amplification assay only identifies the organism as a member of the ""_M. tuberculosis_ complex""), colony morphology and specific biochemical assays (_M. bovis_ does not produce niacin or reduce nitrate), and intrinsic drug resistance to pyrazinamide among _M. bovis_._M. bovis_ can cause disease in a wide variety of domestic and wild animals, including cattle, goats, sheep, deer, badgers, as well as humans. In humans, consumption of unpasteurized milk products from infected animals is thought to be a common source of infection; however, human-to-human, airborne transmission from patients with _M. bovis_ pulmonary tuberculosis is also possible (Lobue PA, et al. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 2004; 8: 868-72), and from other animals with _M. bovis_pulmonary tuberculosis, as presumably was the case in the news report above.Accurate speciation of isolates from clinical specimens is important for epidemiologic and clinical reasons. However, very frequently, a clinical isolate is only identified as ""_M. tuberculosis_ complex,"" and pyrazinamide resistance is not routinely performed. In such circumstances, the standard 6-month, short-course combination drug therapy for TB, which includes pyrazinamide, is likely to fail, as the 6-month, short-course regimen depends on the rapid bactericidal action of pyrazinamide; without this drug as part of an effective initial regimen, therapy must be prolonged beyond 6 months.Human infection caused by _M. bovis_ has been mostly, but not completely, eradicated in the USA by the use of pasteurization of milk and culling of herds shown positive on tuberculin skin testing, starting in about 1917. _M. bovis_ human infection continues to be reported in the USA.Bovine tuberculosis is endemic in Latin America, including Mexico (Milian F, et al. Rev Latinoam Microbiol. 2000; 42: 13-9). In the US, TB due to _M. bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who acquire the infection in their countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (1,2).People of Hispanic ethnicity and consumption of unpasteurized milk products produced in Latin America are not restricted to states of the USA bordering Mexico. An investigation in New York City identified 35 cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ during 2001-4; 19 of the 23 interviewed patients reported eating cheese produced in Mexico while they were living in the USA (3). In this investigation, of the 35 isolates, 14 were resistant to streptomycin, one was resistant to INH [isoniazid], and 2 were resistant to INH and streptomycin, in addition to being resistant to pyrazinamide. Thus, accurate speciation of clinical isolates identified as ""_M. tuberculosis_ complex"" and drug susceptibility testing are important throughout the country. 1.
