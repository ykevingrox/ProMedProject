EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]Re: ProMED-mail Undiagnosed rash outbreak - Dominican Republic: (AL) itchy rash, children, RFI 20160511.4215147----------------------------------------------------------------------On [10 May 2016], the local health authorities were notified by the [General Directorate of Epidemiology], of the occurrence of a likely outbreak characterized by skin lesions in a school community. The rapid response team began field research to determine the magnitude of the event, assess risk conditions, conduct active search, confirm the outbreak, and implement control measures.Interviews with management and schoolteachers, pupils/affected girls and their parents were made. The center has 145 students, of whom 7 showed vesicular lesions [that in] the 4 to 5 days became of a purulent and pruritic type. Other children also have other types of skin lesions, presumably fungal, on skin and scalp. In the active search in the medical records of emergency and outpatient medical service and other service providers in the area, no additional cases were identified. The research findings suggest pyoderma associated with unhygienic conditions at home.Control actions included visits to school for clinical assessment of cases accompanied by La Altagracia dermatologic center staff, distribution of soap and disinfectant lotions, as well as home visits and recommendations to patients and their families.--Communicated by:EpiCore Member Dr Manuel ColomÌ©Gerente de EpidemiologÌ a,Hospital PediÌÁtrico Dr Hugo MendozaSanto DomingoDominican Republic[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Manuel ColomÌ© for his comments concerning the etiologies causing an outbreak of itchy skin rashes in schoolchildren in La Altagracia, Dominican Republic. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6746>.]
