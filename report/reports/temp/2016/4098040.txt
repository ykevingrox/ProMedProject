She said that since the declaration of an Ebola free Liberia, many pregnant women and girls are still reluctant to seek care in the health care delivery system, something she said is a major challenge for Liberia's health sector.Dr. Dahn said: ""The Ebola outbreak did not only cripple an already devastated system in our country health care delivery system, it also eroded the confidence in the health care delivery system. Pregnant women and girls were most affected by the social upset of this. So, up to today [15 Mar 2016], there are many pregnant women and girls who are still reluctant to seek care in the health care delivery system.""The Ministry survey conducted by international groups after the Ebola outbreak shows that the death rate in pregnant women from Ebola during the outbreak was even higher than the general population. ""The World Bank also recently estimated that maternal mortality will increase, and for our country, they projected 111% more than what it is currently, or 1072 per 100 000 live births,"" she said.Making remarks at a 2-day Mano River Maternal Health Response sub-regional coordination meeting, she said that the meeting of Mano River Union countries is an opportunity for member countries to come together to share experiences for providing maternal health care during emergency situations. ""It caught us unaware; it is a gender issue, but we believe we have learned some lessons that we can build on, especially when there are emergencies for women. We also learned that the lesson learnt can also be taken into our general program for women's health,"" she added. ...more[Byline: Henry Karmo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Mano River is a river in West Africa; it originates in the Guinea Highlands in Liberia and forms part of the Liberia-Sierra Leone border. The districts through which the river flows include the Parrot's Beak area of Guinea, Liberia's Lofa County and the Kono and Kailahun District of Sierra Leone. Thus, the river flows through the 3 countries most recently affected by Ebola, leading to the name of the women's initiative.This meeting led to a midwifery response initiative to share lessons and other pertinent information across the countries struck by Ebola. It is important to build a path forward to strengthen the health system, not only to strengthen maternal health care but also to increase detection of infectious diseases in the population (see brief report below). Rebuilding the maternal health system in the 3 countries by working together is an important step in the right direction to rebuild the public health infrastructure. - Mod.LK]******[3] News, NGO, Research16 Mar 2016 Liberia: As Ebola wanes, a spike in infectious diseases sweeps through Liberia.<http://www.statnews.com/2016/03/16/liberia-tuberculosis-after-ebola/>[The impact of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic can be seen at health clinics in Liberia: running water is sporadic, drugs are in short supply, and the medical system is still struggling.

We knew that the viruses were interacting with healthy cells, but the way in which they bound together was still a mystery.'""The researchers used nano-sized crystals, about a millionth of a mm in size, called 'quantum dots,' that mimicked the shape of the viruses and acted as technological stand-ins in experiments to reveal how they bind to cells.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>.
