Korea Herald [edited]<http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160831000642>South Korea has confirmed an additional case of cholera, raising the number of people infected with the waterborne disease here to 3, officials said on Wed [31 Aug 2016]. A 64 year old man residing on the southern island of Geoje is presumed to have contracted the disease from eating seafood earlier this month, the South Gyeongsang Provincial Government said. The regional government said the man received treatment at an intensive unit of a hospital in the southern port city of Busan after complaining of a stomachache. The patient remains in stable condition but is under quarantine, officials said, noting that he had no contact with the previously infected patients.Last week, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the 1st case of the disease after a 59 year old man in the southern city of Gwangju was diagnosed, the 1st case in 15 years.All 3 people consumed seafood at different restaurants on Geoje Island, officials said. Inspections are currently under way at the local restaurant the man visited, the provincial government said, suspecting the cholera bacterium may have been in imported seafood.The diarrheal disease, which is curable with proper medication and treatment, annually affects 3 to 5 million people and claims more than 100 000 lives throughout the world.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[To date, I have kept the South Korea cholera reports as a standalone as there had been no cases in 15 years. In areas where there is adequate sewage treatment and clean potable water, _Vibrio cholerae_ can be introduced but is not able to spread in outbreak form. The specific serotype and biotype of the organism has not yet been reported. All 3 cases seem to have been acquired via eating undercooked or raw seafood. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195>.]
