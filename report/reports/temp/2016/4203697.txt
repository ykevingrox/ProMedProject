The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN) [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Mumbai-maternal-deaths-Hepatitis-top-killer-beats-TB/articleshow/52085302.cms>Maternal deaths in the city [Mumbai capital of Maharashtra] dipped to 311 in 2015-16 with hepatitis overtaking tuberculosis as a bigger killer. Data released by the BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation also known as. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is the civic body that governs the capital city of Mumbai] recently has revealed that an overwhelming majority of the fatalities [really not a majority but the highest percentage of the total - Mod.LL] (14 percent) were caused by hepatitis A and E infections, both preventable by practicing good hygiene and using clean water.Deaths caused by tuberculosis slipped to No. 4 from 2015's 2nd spot. In 2015-16, sepsis and haemorrhage accounted for 8 percent and 7 percent of the mortalities. The last few years, barring 2013-14, have seen a consistent rise in the deaths. Maternal deaths in the city have dipped to 311 in the last financial year compared to 319 in 2014-15, yet there is little to rejoice.The highest percentage of the 311 deaths among pregnant women in 2015-16 were caused by hepatitis A and E infections, revealed data recently released by the civic body. Around 14 percent of the deaths were caused by hepatitis, followed by sepsis, hemorrhage and tuberculosis that contributed to 8 percent, 7 percent and 6 percent of the mortalities respectively .The emergence of a [non-obstetrical] infectious disease as the top killer, and not obstetric causes such as hemorrhage or sepsis, has surprised the medical community. ""The numbers are intriguing. Hepatitis A and E infections during pregnancy pose a huge risk of liver failure and even death,"" said Dr Y M Nandanwar, head of gynecology at Sion hospital. He explained that the interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy often makes a woman vulnerable.""Hepatitis is known to be a killer in pregnancy in the subcontinent due to its impact on estrogen and progesterone hormones added with immunological reasons,"" said Dr Aparna Hegde, founder of ARMMAN that has been working with the BMC on maternal health through mobile devices. But health activists are certain that the water crisis in urban slums has an important role to play in the rise of hepatitis maternal deaths. Hepatitis E is a water-borne pathogen transmitted by the fecal-oral route. ""While slums in Dharavi have access to tap water, most places in Malwani or Mankhurd are at the mercy of tankers. In the absence of proper hygiene and eating practices, the health of pregnant women is majorly compromised,"" said Dr Armida Fernandez, founder of NGO SNEHA that works towards neonatal and maternal health.Incidentally, deaths caused by tuberculosis, a dreaded infectious disease that generally affects the lungs, has climbed down from the spot of the 2nd biggest killer to assume the 4th position last year [2015]--it contributed to 6 percent maternal deaths in 2015-16 compared to 11 percent in [2014-15]. ""It shows that the preliminary screening of pregnant women for TB is making a difference,"" a BMC officer said.Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI on maternal deaths, expressed concern that 51 percent of the fatalities were from the city, and not peripheral regions, where medical facilities are lacking. ""It highlights the lack of crucial childbirth facilities,"" he said. BMC executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar, however, said, ""We handle some of the worst pregnancy-related complications because the tertiary hospitals and medical colleges are here. We also have one of the best surveillance systems.""As for solutions, Dr Hegde suggested that simple things like washing hands, boiling water and cleaning vegetables properly can curb the hepatitis [A and E] infections.[Byline: Sumitra Deb Roy]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although this report clumps hepatitis A and hepatitis E together as a cause of maternal mortality, the risk of maternal deaths from hepatitis is primarily related to hepatitis E, particularly genotype 1 which predominates in the greater Ganges floodplains of Asia. Indeed, Labrique and colleagues (1) felt that almost 10 percent of pregnancy-related mortality in Asia could be caused by hepatitis E and as many as 10 500 maternal deaths could be occurring in the area each year. In this regard, prototypic vaccines are being studied and assessed from efficacy and safety in pregnancy (2).Regarding acute hepatitis A infection in pregnancy, Elinav et al (3) reported on 13 cases of 2nd or 3rd trimester HAV infection. No maternal mortality was appreciated but 9 of the 13 developed gestational complications including premature contractions, premature rupture of membranes and vaginal bleeding which led to premature deliveries in 8 of the 9. Child outcome was favorable in all cases.References----------1. Labrique AB, Sikder SS, Krain LJ, et al: Hepatitis E, a vaccine-preventable cause of maternal deaths.
