He was classified as a primary case with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Sporadic primary cases continue to be reported in Saudi Arabia. It appears as though there is a seasonal(?) increase in the reporting of the sporadic cases. In the past 3 days, there were 6 newly confirmed cases. All 6 were classified as primary cases, 2 of whom had a history of direct contact with camels, and the remaining 4 were still under investigation for possible high risk exposures. One can't help but wonder whether there are case control studies underway to attempt to identify further ""high risk exposures"" in those individuals classified as primary cases with undocumented history of known high risk exposures during the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Clearly, something is going on in Saudi Arabia. In the absence of nosocomial transmission, as seen in earlier outbreaks, there is still significant ""sporadic transmission"" with 6 newly confirmed cases reported during the 1st 4 days of December 2016 and 20 reported cases during the month of October 2016, with fairly widespread geographic distribution of the cases throughout the country.Maps showing the locations of the cases can be found at the source URL, and the HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
