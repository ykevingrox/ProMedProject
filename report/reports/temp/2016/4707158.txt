The distribution of the disease with respect to age and gender, the virulent nature of the disease and the risk factors would be the other parameters of the study, he said. ""The outbreak is on the decline,"" said Dr. Arun Kumar. The team will look into the contamination of water sources in the area, taking into consideration the incidence of the disease in the area over the years.According to health officials, the team would examine whether it was a combination of hepatitis A and hepatitis E that prevailed in the outbreak.
