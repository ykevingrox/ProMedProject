Sayel claimed that the government was not even showing concern as to whether the children should be in school this academic year [2016], adding if the government fails to do so, his organization would ensure that they enrolled in any public school whether or not they have uniforms, text books and other school materials.Sayel also said they were finding it difficult to access healthcare because it is usually difficult for EVD survivors to get treatment at the various hospitals, once they are identified as an EVD survivor.When contacted the deputy minister for public affairs at the Ministry of Information and Culture Affairs, Isaac Jackson, said the appropriate authority responsible for Ebola survivors would be contacted on the well-being of the children.][This report and the previous post raise the issue of treatment of survivors of EVD. It is critical that children be reintegrated into society in order to regain normality in the communities affected by Ebola, and that everyone receive equal access to health care. Education will go a long way to informing people of how Ebola virus is transmitted and what they do need to avoid becoming infected and what they need not be concerned about. - Mod.LK]14 Sep 2016 Sierra Leone: Ebola lessons spur on Sierra Leone's fight against maternal deaths<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/09/14/ebola-lessons-spur-on-sierra-leones-fight-against-maternal-deaths.html>[Women giving birth in Sierra Leone do so in a country estimated to have the world's highest rate of maternal deaths.

Maternal deaths had been one-half of those in 1990.Maternal and child deaths spiked as a result of the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreak, and Sierra Leone's maternal mortality rate soared to 1360 deaths per 100 000 births last year [2015] from 1100 in 2013, according to data from the United Nations.When EVD struck Sierra Leone, the world's worst EVD outbreak in the world decimated Sierra Leone's fragile health system, killing 1/10th of the country's doctors, and scared people away from health centers...]14 Sep 2016 UK: Nurse cleared in Ebola case ""would not have knowingly put anyone in danger""<http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/nurse-cleared-in-ebola-case-would-not-have-knowingly-put-anyone-in-danger-35047624.html>[Nurse PC, a registered nurse for 18 years who survived the Ebola virus disease (EVD), has been cleared of misconduct over her return to the UK with the virus, saying she would never have knowingly put anyone in danger. PC was accused of allowing an incorrect temperature to be recorded in a ""chaotic"" screening center in Heathrow on her return from west Africa in late 2014.An independent panel at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in Edinburgh found 3 charges against her were not proven and her fitness to practice was not affected. The panel ruled her judgment at the airport in December 2014 had been so impaired by the developing illness that she could not be found guilty of misconduct. The panel, referencing PC's ""exhausted and increasingly unwell state"" after returning from Sierra Leone, concluded: ""In your diminished medical state, you were swept along by events."" PC's lawyer, Joyce Cullen, criticized Public Health England (PHE), which ran the airport screening area described during the hearing as ""disorganized and chaotic"". Cullen said of her client: ""She willingly put her life at risk to travel to Sierra Leone to work as a volunteer helping to treat people suffering from Ebola. She and hundreds of other volunteers played a vital role in saving lives, helping to curb the epidemic in extremely challenging circumstances.""][Thank goodness good sense prevailed.

(EPUB 2016, preprint). bioRxiv. doi: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/075168>AbstractThe phylogenetic relationships of _Zaire ebolavirus_ have been intensively analyzed over the course of the 2013-2016 outbreak. However, there has been limited consideration of the functional impact of this variation. Here we describe an analysis of the available sequence data in the context of protein structure and phylogenetic history. Amino acid replacements are rare and predicted to have minor effects on protein stability. Synonymous mutations greatly outnumber nonsynonymous mutations, and most of the latter fall into unstructured intrinsically disordered regions, indicating that purifying selection is the dominant mode of selective pressure. However, one replacement, occurring early in the outbreak in Gueckedou in Guinea on 31 Mar 2014 (alanine to valine at position 82 in the GP protein), is close to the site where the virus binds to the host receptor NPC1 and is located in the phylogenetic tree at the origin of the major B lineage of the outbreak. The functional and evolutionary evidence indicates this A82V change likely has consequences for EBOV's host specificity and hence adaptation to humans.]16 Sep 2016: Implementation of a national semen testing and counseling program for male Ebola survivors<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6536a5.htm>[Citation.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2016 (16 Sep);65:963-6. doi: <http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6536a5>.SummaryWhat is already known about this topic?Persistence of Ebola virus in semen of survivors of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) was documented before the 2014 outbreak in West Africa; however, the duration of viral persistence continues to exceed previous estimates. To prevent sexual transmission of Ebola, semen testing services have been established in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.What is added by this report?In 2015, the 1st nationwide semen testing and counseling program for male Ebola survivors, the Men's Health Screening Program [MHSP], was established in Liberia. Challenges in establishing and operating the program included securing sufficient resources for the program, managing a public health semen testing program in the context of ongoing research studies also collecting and screening semen, identification of adequate numbers of trained counselors and appropriate health communication messages for the program, overcoming Ebola survivor-associated stigma, identification and recruitment of male Ebola survivors, and operation of mobile teams. Approximately 80 per cent of enrollees have graduated from the program.What are the implications for public health practice?Engagement with the survivor community, communication, and flexibility were important to the success of the program. Lessons learned during the establishment of the MHSP in Liberia might inform the planning and implementation of future semen testing programs for other sexually transmissible diseases.]16 Sep 2016: Trial reporting in ClinicalTrials.gov -- the final rule<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1611785>[Citation.Zarin DA, Tse T, Williams RJ, Carr S, et al.

N Engl J Med. 16 Sep 2016; doi: 10.1056/NEJMsr1611785Title VIII of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) expanded the legal mandate for sponsors and others responsible for certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated drug, biologic, and device products to register their studies and report summary results information to ClinicalTrials.gov, which is managed by the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The statute expanded registration requirements and provided a legally defined timeline with specific requirements for the systematic reporting of summary trial results.

The EUAL is a special procedure that can be implemented when there is an outbreak of a disease with high rates of morbidity or mortality and a lack of treatment or prevention options.Preparations are also underway to initiate a 1st-in-human study for a multivalent vaccine regimen to combat Ebola, Sudan and Marburg viruses.EUAL assists UN [United Nations] member states and procurement agencies to determine the acceptability for use of a specific vaccine in a public health emergency. The decision to grant EUAL the investigational preventative vaccine regimen will be based on an evaluation of available data including quality, safety, and immunogenicity, as well as a risk/benefit analysis. While EUAL potentially allows for deployment of a vaccine in an emergency, the vaccine remains investigational pending formal regulatory agency review and approval.Citation.
