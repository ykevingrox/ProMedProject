As of 3 May 2016, a total of 183 people have come down with food poisoning after eating the pastries, according to a joint statement issued on Thursday (5 May 2016) by the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Health (MOH) and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore. This is an increase of 107 cases from the 76 previously reported.""Since the news broke in the media, more have stepped forward to notify that they too, may have been affected after consumption of the durian pastries,"" the statement said. The hotel's bakery license, which has been suspended since 22 Apr 2016, has not yet been restored. The suspension will continue to be in force until the lapses that might have contributed to the outbreak have been rectified, the Government agencies said.Goodwood Park Hotel has previously said that it treats all matters related to food safety standards ""very seriously"". ""We are addressing the food handling lapses in the durian pastry kitchen highlighted by NEA and aim to rectify them soonest possible,"" the hotel management said. Goodwood Park added that it is cooperating closely with MOH and NEA on necessary follow-up actions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to an earlier report (<http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tainted-durian-pastries/2722572.html>) cases began to occur on between 15 Mar and 16 Apr 2016. It is not stated whether the new cases occurred after the closure of the bakery or were discovered from surveillance.The symptoms of the reported illnesses are not given. Without knowing the incubation time between the illness and the onset of symptoms and if there was fever as well, it is difficult to speculate the etiology of the illnesses here. Afebrile illnesses with nausea and vomiting suggest staphylococcal enterotoxin or heavy metal exposure. Overt, non-toxin related bacterial infections should have an incubation period of several days and are more likely to cause febrile diarrheal illnesses.Durian fruit (<http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/durian-fruit.html>) ""is delicious, soft, succulent and very popular for its unique characteristics. Durian is widely revered as the ""King of Fruits"" in the South-East Asian countries. It is botanically known as _Durio zibethinus_.Durian is a seasonal fruit; its season lasts typically from June until August which coincides with that of the other tropical specific fruits like mangosteen, jackfruit, and mango.Durian fruit is distinctive for its large size, unique odor, and formidable thorn-covered husk. It can reach up to 30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, and typically weighs 1 to 4 kilograms (2 to 7 pounds). In shape, it varies from round to oblong; color of its husk (rind) is green with brown; and its flesh features creamy-yellow to saffron color bulbs depending upon the species. The flesh or pulp of durian can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and is used as flavoring agent in a wide variety of culinary and sweet preparations in Southeast Asian cuisines. Its edible flesh emits a distinctive odor which can be described as strong and penetrating, appreciable from far even while its husk is intact. This unusual stinky and intense odor of the durian fruit may have prompted many people to express diverse and peculiar opinions ranging from deep appreciation to disgusting.""A picture of the fruit can be found at: <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Durian.jpg>. - Mod.
