Cell Stem Cell 2016; 19; doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2016.04.014----------------------------------------------------------------------Highlights----------- hESC-derived cerebral organoids model fetal brain development- Zika virus infects neural progenitor cells in organoid and neurosphere models- Zika virus activates Toll-like receptor 3 in cerebral organoids- TLR3 triggers apoptosis and attenuates neurogenesisSummary----------Emerging evidence from the current outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) indicates a strong causal link between Zika and microcephaly. To investigate how ZIKV infection leads to microcephaly, we used human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids to recapitulate early stage, 1st trimester fetal brain development. Here we show that a prototype strain of ZIKV, MR766, efficiently infects organoids and causes a decrease in overall organoid size that correlates with the kinetics of viral copy number. The innate immune receptor Toll-like-Receptor 3 (TLR3) was upregulated after ZIKV infection of human organoids and mouse neurospheres and TLR3 inhibition reduced the phenotypic effects of ZIKV infection. Pathway analysis of gene expression changes during TLR3 activation highlighted 41 genes also related to neuronal development, suggesting a mechanistic connection to disrupted neurogenesis. Together, therefore, our findings identify a link between ZIKV-mediated TLR3 activation, perturbed cell fate, and a reduction in organoid volume reminiscent of microcephaly.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[We await the results of the follow up experiments that surely must come, to further the linkage of Zika virus infection and TLR3 activation. - Mod.TY]******[4] Diagnostic testDate: Thu 5 Apr 2016Source: Cell [edited]<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.059>Ref: Pardee K, Green AA, Takahashi MK, et al: Rapid, low-cost detection of Zika virus using programmable biomolecular components.

Here, we report a pipeline for the rapid design, assembly, and validation of cell-free, paper-based sensors for the detection of the Zika virus RNA genome. By linking isothermal RNA amplification to toehold switch RNA sensors, we detect clinically relevant concentrations of Zika virus sequences and demonstrate specificity against closely related dengue virus sequences. When coupled with a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based module, our sensors can discriminate between viral strains with single-base resolution. We successfully demonstrate a simple, field-ready sample-processing workflow and detect Zika virus from the plasma of a viremic macaque. Our freeze-dried biomolecular platform resolves important practical limitations to the deployment of molecular diagnostics in the field and demonstrates how synthetic biology can be used to develop diagnostic tools for confronting global health crises.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[With Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus infections being so similar clinically, a rapid, inexpensive test that can differentiate between them will be a valuable diagnostic tool.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 65 [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6518e1.htm>Ref: Interim Guidance for Zika virus testing of urine -- United States, 2016; MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6518e1----------------------------------------------------------------------Diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection can be accomplished using molecular and serologic methods. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the preferred test for Zika virus infection because it can be performed rapidly and is highly specific. However, in most patients, Zika virus RNA is unlikely to be detected in serum after the 1st week of illness. Recent reports using adaptations of previously published methods suggest that Zika virus RNA can be detected in urine for at least 2 weeks after onset of symptoms. Currently, the CDC Trioplex rRT-PCR assay is the only diagnostic tool authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for Zika virus testing of urine. Other laboratory-developed tests will need in-house validations to adequately characterize the performance of the assay and meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments requirements. Further investigation is needed to determine the sensitivity and utility of Zika virus rRT-PCR on urine specimens collected 14 days or more after onset of symptoms.On the basis of the newly available data, CDC recommends that Zika virus rRT-PCR be performed on urine collected less than 14 days after onset of symptoms in patients with suspected Zika virus disease. Zika virus rRT-PCR testing of urine should be performed in conjunction with serum testing if using specimens collected less than 7 days after symptom onset. A positive result in either specimen type provides evidence of Zika virus infection. Procedures for the collection and submission of body fluids, including urine specimens, have been described previously. CDC recommendations for Zika virus testing of serum and other clinical specimens remain unchanged at this time. CDC will continue to review and update guidance for Zika virus testing as new data become available.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is reassuring to see promising tools come along for diagnosis of Zika virus infections. Extending the time period for reliable diagnosis of Zika virus infection from 7 days to 14 will be very helpful for clinicians as well as for public health workers tracking the incidence and geographic occurrence of this virus. Because of the similarity of symptoms of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue virus infections, clinical diagnoses bring an element of uncertainty that laboratory tests can resolve in localities where all of these viruses co-circulate. It is not clear how practical it would be to extend this diagnostic technology for routine use beyond sophisticated central laboratories. - Mod.TY]******[6] Rhesus monkey infection modelDate: Tue 10 May 2016Source: bioRxiv [edited]<http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/10/046334>Ref: Dudley DM, Aliota MT, Mohr EL, et al: A rhesus macaque model of Asia lineage Zika virus infection. bioRxiv doi: 10.1101/046334----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Infection with Asian lineage Zika virus has been associated with Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome and fetal abnormalities, but the mechanisms and risk factors for these outcomes remain unknown. Here we show that rhesus macaques are susceptible to infection by an Asian-lineage virus closely related to strains currently circulating in the Americas. Following subcutaneous inoculation, Zika virus RNA was detected in plasma one day post-infection (dpi) in all animals (N=8, including 2 animals infected during the 1st trimester of pregnancy). Plasma viral loads peaked above 1 x 5 base 10 viral RNA copies/mL in 7 of 8 animals. Viral RNA was also present in saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), consistent with case reports from infected humans. Viral RNA was cleared from plasma and urine by 21 dpi [days post-inoculation] in non-pregnant animals. In contrast, both pregnant animals remained viremic longer, up to 57 days. In all animals, infection was associated with transient increases in proliferating natural killer cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all animals by 21 dpi. Rechallenge of 3 non-pregnant animals with the Asian-lineage Zika virus 10 weeks after the initial challenge resulted in no detectable virus replication, suggesting that primary Zika virus infection elicits protective immunity against homologous virus strains. These data establish that Asian-lineage Zika virus infection of rhesus macaques provides a relevant animal model for studying pathogenesis in pregnant and non-pregnant individuals and evaluating potential interventions against human infection, including during pregnancy.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This study establishes the susceptibility of rhesus monkeys for Zika virus infection with resulting viremias of high titer and long duration, as well as a similar duration of viruria. Interestingly, the viremias of the 2 pregnant animals were much longer than of the non-pregnant animals.The full article indicates that virus was present in the brains of the fetuses and the authors speculate may have contributed to the long-term viremia of their mothers. Fetuses and mothers continue to be monitored. One of the major drawbacks of rhesus monkeys as models of human infection is the high cost of purchase or maintenance.ProMED-mail subscribers interested in the details of these interesting experiments and their results are encouraged to read the full report, available at the source URL above. - Mod.TY]
