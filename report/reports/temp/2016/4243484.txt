El Diario de AysÌ©n [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.diarioaysen.cl/sitio/2016/05/23/nuevo-caso-fue-confirmado-por-el-instituto-de-salud-publica/>During the weekend [21-22 May 2016], a 28 year old patient was admitted into the hospital intensive care unit in Coyhaique [AisÌ©n region] with the clinical picture of a [hanta]virus [infection], without confirmed contact with rodents. Given this situation, he was taken to Santiago, and currently is in the Thorax Hospital, with this information corroborated by the AisÌ©n Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; director of the regional ministry of health], Ana MarÌ a Navarrete, who added, ""The information that we have is that he is progressing, out of mortal danger.""The patient is a construction worker who installs screens, and began this work a couple of months ago. Health authorities are investigating the sites where he has worked. Also, they are inquiring checking his residence for indications of the presence of rodents that carry hantavirus.Navarrete took the opportunity to remind inhabitants of the region about the measures to prevent hantavirus [infections], especially with scarce rains and cold. ""Because of this, we have a rodent population that we must consider,"" she added and urged that spaces around houses be kept clean as well as the houses themselves, especially those places where there is food, or which are used for eating. In the case of people who work in agriculture or outdoors, she recommended ventilation of storage buildings or sheds before entering to get machines or tools.It is worth remembering that to prevent hantavirus [exposure], before entering a house that has been closed for a long time, one must ventilate it for 30 minutes, look to see if there are signs of rodents, and later clean with a bleach solution. Other general measures are: keep pastures cut short to avoid rodents hiding there; dispose of garbage in well sealed bags separate from the house; keep the home clean; and protect food in hermetically sealed receptacles.To date, this is the 2nd case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the region.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It will be interesting to see if the field epidemiological investigations shed some light on the conditions under which this young man became infected.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. The AisÌ©n (AysÌ©n) region, like much of central and southern Chile, is endemic for Andes hantavirus and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Infections are acquired when people are exposed to virus-containing excreta from infected rodents. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/chilfung/chile_regions.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16830>. - Mod.TY]
