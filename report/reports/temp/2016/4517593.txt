Becker's Hospital Review [edited]<http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/york-hospital-identifies-4-more-patients-infected-from-heater-cooler-devices.html>In October 2015, WellSpan York (Pennsylvania) Hospital announced 8 open-heart surgery patients contracted an infection from heater-cooler devices [units, HCUs] used during surgery. Now, the hospital has identified 4 more patients with infections, bringing the total to 12, according to the York Dispatch. From the 12 total, 6 have died, and 1 of the 6 living patients is no longer receiving treatment, York Dispatch reported. The hospital had sent warnings to 1300 former patients. In addition to the new confirmed patients, York Hospital also identified 2 patients who likely had the infection but died before it could be confirmed, according to an FAQ [Frequently Asked Questions] posted online by WellSpan Health. The infections are caused by non-tuberculous mycobacterium [NTM], which is commonly found in nature but can cause infections in people with weakened immune systems.The heater-cooler devices used during open-heart surgery to regulate patient temperatures have been implicated in spreading the NTM infections. NTM are slow-growing bacteria, so infection symptoms can be delayed. The infection is treatable, however. Other hospitals have had similar issues with the devices: Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia; Mercy Medical Center-Des Moines in Iowa; and Penn State Hershey (PA) Medical Center have all warned patients of the possibility of an NTM infection linked to heater-cooler machines. In September of last year [2015], the CDC [1] and the Food and Drug Administration [2] issued separate guidance on the heater-cooler machines. 1. CDC.

These European patients developed endocarditis, aortic root abscess, sternal wound infection, and disseminated infection due to _M. chimaera_. The species of NTM involved in the US cases has not been specified and neither have the types of infection been specified. _M. chimaera_ is a slow growing acid-fast bacillus that is commonly found in environmental water and soil (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/6/3/266.full.pdf>). Because of its close relationship to _M. intracellulare_, _M. chimaera_ strains can be misidentified as _M. intracellulare_. _M. chimaera_ is known to cause pulmonary disease, but until the reports from Switzerland (1, 2), _M. chimaera_ had not been reported as a cause of bloodstream infection or endocarditis. Mycobacterial endocarditis is rare, and the predominant causative mycobacterial pathogens are the rapidly growing NTM _Mycobacterium chelonae_ and _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ (<http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-76382015000100017&script=sci_arttext>).References----------1.
