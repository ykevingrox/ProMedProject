The Ministry of Social Welfare and Gender and Children Affairs is responsible for the packages.

Ebola is a devastating illness for children, particularly those under 5 years of age. Although children are proportionally less affected than adults during outbreaks of Ebola, including in the current West Africa outbreak, it remains a major threat to child health in the affected nations and a neglected area of investigation and discussion. The threat is not only for those infected with Ebola but for all children in the affected region because of the tremendous impact of this outbreak on national health care systems.2 Jan 2016 USA: Microscopy Innovations helps the Army combat Ebola <http://host.madison.com/wsj/business/technology/biotech/tech-and-biotech-ensodata-helps-find-sleep-apnea-microscopy-innovations/article_23e71219-cfec-55ea-9ce3-c6f204d0000c.html>[Microscopy Innovations makes a capsule shaped like the tip of a pipette, a tool that looks like an eyedropper, commonly found in labs for holding liquids.

Bulked up in biohazard suits and double gloves, scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, at Fort Detrick, Maryland found it hard to handle the grids to apply an Ebola sample. The fragile, little disks are held with needle-sharp forceps, and about 80 percent of them were damaged in the process because of the unwieldy safety apparel. Now, the bare grids are preloaded into Microscopy's capsule, and the virus solution is sucked up into it, so researchers don't have to manipulate the disks while they are suited up. - more]5 Jan 2016 Worldwide: Bat-human disease risk is mapped across the globe, showing Ebola could appear in more placesResearch article: <http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684391?journalCode=an>Zoonotic disease map:Citation: Brierley L, Maarten J V, Olival KJ, et al. Quantifying Global Drivers of Zoonotic Bat Viruses: A Process-Based Perspective. The University of Chicago Press Journals, The American Journalist.Abstract. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), particularly zoonoses, represent a significant threat to global health. Emergence is often driven by anthropogenic activity (e.g., travel, land use change). Although disease emergence frameworks suggest multiple steps from initial zoonotic transmission to human-to-human spread, there have been few attempts to empirically model specific steps. We create a process-based framework to separate out components of individual emergence steps. We focus on early emergence and expand the 1st step, zoonotic transmission, into processes of generation of pathogen richness, transmission opportunity, and establishment, each with its own hypothesized drivers. Using this structure, we build a spatial empirical model of these drivers, taking bat viruses shared with humans as a case study. We show that drivers of both viral richness (host diversity and climatic variability) and transmission opportunity (human population density, bushmeat hunting, and livestock production) are associated with virus sharing between humans and bats. We also show spatial heterogeneity between the global patterns of these two processes, suggesting that high-priority locations for pathogen discovery and surveillance in wildlife may not necessarily coincide with those for public health intervention. Finally, we offer direction for future studies of zoonotic EIDs by highlighting the importance of the processes underlying their emergence.Drugs & vaccines-------------6 Jan 2016 USA: Army begins phase 2 trial of Johnson & Johnson's prime-boost Ebola vaccine<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/01/news-scan-jan-07-2016>Johnson & Johnson's prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimen is entering phase 2 clinical trials in both healthy and HIV-infected people, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) announced in a press release. This trial involves 2 vaccine candidates, a priming dose of Ad26.ZEBOV from Crucell Holland B.V., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and a booster dose of MVA-BN-Filo from Bavarian Nordic. Phase 2 trials assess vaccine safety and immune response. The study will include 75 adults up to age 70 who will receive the vaccines at the WRAIR Clinical Trials Center in Silver Spring, MD. Early next year [2017?], WRAIR-affiliated sites in Africa will also begin evaluating the regimen as well as a vaccination schedule that flips the order of the 2 vaccines. - more31 Dec 2015 USA: Unfilled Vials<http://news.sciencemag.org/policy/2015/12/unfilled-vials>Vaccines that appear scientifically feasible often move through development slowly because they have little commercial potential and thus have trouble attracting serious investments. Just such a situation held back R&D on Ebola vaccines, one of which quickly proved its worth in a real-world trial held in Guinea last year [2014]. In the wake of that success, a growing number of researchers and public health advocates are lobbying to find new money and strategies to develop vaccines that could thwart both outbreak diseases like chikungunya and Marburg to endemic afflictions like paratyphoid fever and schistosomiasis. In response to a survey designed by Science, 50 vaccine experts ranked 10 vaccine-vulnerable diseases in order of development priority based on needs and the likelihood that they would work. -- Read the Full Text.

So far only about 70 volunteers have been recruited. The last case recruited was from the Liberia EVD outbreak of November 2015 when 3 new EVD cases were confirmed in Liberia.According to Dr. Clifford Lane of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of the scientists overseeing the trial, ""If we had been able to get started 6 months earlier, it would have been very simple. There would have been, sadly, plenty of cases [to study.] The challenge now is, without enough cases to rapidly enroll, you run the risk of not getting a final, robust answer.""]9 Jan 2016 West Africa: WHO ready to approve the Ebola Zaire vaccine V2920<http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Ebola--malaria-vaccines--HIV-treatments-expected-in-2016-/-/2558/3027508/-/ddfwslz/-/index.html>[The World Health Organization (WHO) reports it will approve the Ebola Zaire vaccine V2920 after assessing it.

That encouraging news was tempered, though, by a report that suggests a treatment many had hoped would help Ebola patients survive didn't work in another study. The 2nd study, published in the same journal, found that giving Ebola patients 2 transfusions of plasma -- a blood product -- from survivors of the disease did not improve their chances. It was thought antibodies in survivors' blood might intensify the immune response in Ebola patients. Researchers and the WHO were quick to point out the disappointing findings shouldn't be read to mean survivors' blood has no place in Ebola treatment. They said transfusions containing high concentrations -- known as titers -- of antibodies might still work. Combined, the 2 studies show both the importance of testing would-be therapies and of sheer luck in research.]6 Jan 2016 West Africa: Ebola studies pan convalescent plasma, find hope for malaria regimen<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/01/ebola-studies-pan-convalescent-plasma-find-hope-malaria-regimen>[A longer, in depth report][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report includes contributions by ProMED Correspondent Mary MarshallA zoonotic niche map of the countries where cases have occurred in the field or been imported is at <http://healthmap.org/ebola>.
