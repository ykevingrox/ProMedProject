Star Africa, APA (African Press Agency) report [edited]<http://en.starafrica.com/news/two-lassa-fever-cases-detected-in-togo.html>During the past week, 2 cases of Lassa fever have been detected in the Togolese district of Oti [Savanes region] over 500 km [310 miles] north of the capital Lome, the country's Health minister revealed in a statement on Tuesday [15 Mar 2016]. The minister was, however, quick to call for calm, advising the population not to give into panic but to instead strictly abide by measures being deployed against the disease, which is curable.""The sooner a patient is admitted to a health facility, the more they stand a chance to be cured,"" his statement said, adding that a toll-free hotline has been put at the disposal of the general public.The minister's statement described Lassa fever as an acute, viral disease, communicable to humans by rats whose urine or faeces contaminate food or household items.""The virus can also be transmitted from human to human through direct contact with blood, urine, faeces, vomit or other body fluids of a sick person,"" the statement explained.Symptoms of Lassa fever range from fever, headache, sore throat, coughing, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea to muscle aches, chest pain and bleeding among others.--Communicated by:ProMED-FRA<promed-fra@promedmail.org>[A 14 Mar 2016 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20160314.4090655) indicated that there were 2 suspected Lassa fever cases in Togo. It is not clear if those 2 cases reported above by the Health Minister are those or are new cases.Virus transmission can occur in houses, in hospital environments, or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. Nosocomial infections can occur in health care centers if barrier nursing practices and use of personal protective equipment are not implemented. Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.
