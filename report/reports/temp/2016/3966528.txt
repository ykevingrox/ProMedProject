Let us be precise: 95 percent or even more adult dromedaries have antibodies against MERS-CoV and are immune against the disease, and no virus is found in this age-group. Only a very small number of dromedary calves, after the maternal antibodies against MERS-CoV have disappeared, may be infectious. This is the age group which should be vaccinated.--Priv. Doz. Dr. Dr. habil. U. WerneryScientific DirectorCentral Veterinary Research LaboratoryDubai - United Arab Emirates<cvrl@cvrl.ae>[Prof Wernery is gratefully acknowledged for the above observation. His expertise in the matter is based upon extensive investigations on the ground, primarily in Dubai (see the references, co-authored by him, below).There is still a while to go before a MERS-CoV vaccine is developed, tested, approved and certified.What is ""the age group (of the dromedary calves) which should be vaccinated,"" as suggested by Prof Wernery? This may be estimated from the following excerpt, derived from ref. 1:""The restricted and highly compartmentalized social structure of livestock camels would provide population niches in which viruses can differentiate in isolation after bottleneck-type transmission events. This situation holds promise for control of the spread of MERS-CoV through flock management practices, and it also suggests a rather simple way of avoiding camel-to-human transmission by avoiding camels (under) 2 years of age. Camel calves are not easily accessible by humans and instinctually avoid humans. They are generally separated from their mothers after 12 months of age (i.e., at an age when they are still likely to be infected with MERS-CoV). Humans normally come into contact with calves only after the animals have been separated from their mothers. A change in this practice (i.e., postponing separation until the calves are older) might reduce the risk for camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission.""Refs.1.
