The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/malaria-deadlier-than-imagined/article8518298.ece>Zika might have made headlines this year [2016], but the 119-year-old malaria is a bigger threat in [India], killing nearly 50 000 people every year.While the officially reported numbers are smaller than actual figures, top health experts in the country opine that malaria is a threat that India needs to fight.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Director-General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), at the International Congress on Infectious Diseases held in the city [Hyderabad] last month [March 2016], spoke about the threat that malaria is posing for the country.In Telangana, 374 cases of malaria, commonly called _Plasmodium vivax_ (Pv) malaria, were reported this year [2016] until February. What is alarming is that an almost equal number of _P. falciparum_ [Pf] infections were reported. The malarial disease caused by Pf can progress to cerebral malaria, which is almost always fatal. Though there are 6 subspecies of _Plasmodium_ that cause the disease, Pv and Pf are the commonly occurring in the country.""Death can occur in as little as 3 days if a Pf infection is not properly treated. While a simple malarial infection can be treated at any clinic, Pf treatment requires advanced critical care,"" informed Dr K Narasimhlu, an Internal Medicine expert at Gandhi Hospital.Last year [2015], Telangana reported 10 205 Pf cases which resulted in 3 reported fatalities. Lack of a vaccine and high cost of treatment often deter the poor from availing treatment. Advice of prevention is what physicians advocate as the complications, besides cerebral malaria, including severe anemia, spleen rupture, and kidney damage can leave a lasting effect on health.""Malaria can be prevented by taking several simple precautions. Awareness of the risk of malaria in high risk zones is the 1st step to preventing malaria,"" Dr Guru Prasad, consultant at CARE Hospitals, said on the eve of World Malaria Day being observed on [25 Apr 2016].""While travelling to a malaria endemic zone, anti-malarial tablets may be prescribed to prevent contracting malaria. Immediate diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and death,"" he added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Malaria is endemic in India but its reporting is unreliable. India reported in 2013 1.1 million cases and 561 fatal outcomes due to malaria. The WHO estimates the true numbers to be in the range of 10 to 26 million. Thus the WHO estimates that as little as 4 percent of actual cases may be reported. If this is applied to the mortality number provided in the World Malaria Report, it can be estimated that the number of deaths attributed to malaria could be approximately 12 500 which is still less than the 50 000 stated in the newspaper. A map showing the distribution of malaria cases in India can be found in the WHO World Malaria Report 2015 <http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/wmr2015-profiles.pdf>. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.]
