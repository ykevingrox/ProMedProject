Cases developed as a result of contact with source of infection, a hare, shot on the territory of the Saksky area near by village of Dobrusina during the hunting season.The incident was reported by the territorial Department of the Yevpatoria Interregional Department of Rospotrebnadzor for the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter. Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation, with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. The type of disease in this case is not stated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22750>.]
