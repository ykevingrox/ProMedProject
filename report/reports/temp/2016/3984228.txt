SAPO [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.sapo.pt/noticias/sobe-para-dez-numero-de-obitos-por-surto-de_56ab67a00a058d484464db9c>The number of deaths caused by the yellow fever outbreak in the Angola capital [Luanda] increased to 10 among the 28 cases of the infection confirmed among the 100 suspected cases, it was announced today [29 Jan 2016] by Luanda health authorities.This includes 2 more deaths added to the last total of 4 days ago, when the Strategic Plan for the Control of Yellow Fever was presented in the Angolan capital.The plan to combat the yellow fever epidemic in Luanda is supported by an appropriation of 2021 525 797 kwanzas (11.9 million euros) [USD 13 million], for the acquisition of yellow fever vaccines and supplies, operational costs for activities, and training and preparation of personnel involved in the effort. The yellow fever vaccination campaign in Luanda is now underway, focusing in this phase on Viana [a suburb of Luanda], where the 1st cases were recorded.To combat this outbreak, 3 specialists from the World Health Organization (WHO) are going to help Luanda health authorities in the assessment of the quantities of vaccine necessary.The Angola Minister of Health, Jose Van-Dunem, acknowledged on [Mon 25 Jan 2015] that the country had quantities of vaccine available for the program of routine yellow fever vaccination, but not enough to respond to an epidemic.The Angola capital registered a yellow fever vaccination coverage of 70 percent in 2015, a comparative reduction from 77 percent that was reached in 2014.--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[It is good to see the vaccination campaign in Luanda being mobilized. In the previous report of YF earlier this week, there were 99 cases, of which 26 were confirmed with 8 deaths (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160127.3965357). These cases occurred in Viana municipality, a suburb of the capital, Luanda, and were reported on 26 Jan 2016.Fortunately, the 70 percent vaccination coverage likely has prevented this outbreak from progressing more rapidly with higher case numbers in a wider area. Curiously, no mention is made of the outbreak in more distant Caluquembe, located in southern Huila province and nearly 1000 km [620 mi] from the Luanda outbreak, nor plans to mount a campaign there.2 suspected cases of yellow fever with 1 death [awaiting confirmation] have been identified in patients admitted to the Municipal Hospital of Amboim, coastal Cuanza Sul province, the head of Provincial Department of Public Health, Maria Lussinga, said Mon [1 Feb 2016] .<http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/saude/2016/1/5/Cuanza-Sul-Two-yellow-fever-cases-identified-Amboim,61d1d660-78b7-40af-b9f6-17c7ba640ebf.html>.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> (provinces) and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10684>. - Mods.TY/JW]
