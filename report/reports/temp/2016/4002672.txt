Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) statistics show that reported cases of the haemorrhagic disease known as Lassa fever stood at 175 with a total of 101 deaths since August. As of today, 19 (including Abuja) states are currently following up contacts, or have suspected cases with laboratory results pending or laboratory confirmed cases, the NCDC said in a statement.West Africa has been battling to contain a flare-up of the virus, according to data from the nation's health authorities released Saturday [6 Feb 2016]. Deaths from the virus were recorded in the nation's political capital, Abuja, Lagos, and 14 other states, the NCDC said.While health authorities assure Africa's most populous country of more than 170 million that they have the virus under control, there are fears the actual scale of the outbreak is under-reported.The NCDC said officials have distributed large quantities of drugs, including Ribavirin tablets, and bottles of hand sanitizers across the country to tackle the disease.It however reported that logistics support and delayed reporting of cases by states are dogging the fight against Lassa fever.The outbreak was only announced in January [2016] -- months after the 1st case occurred in August [2015] -- with subsequent deaths reported in 10 states, including Abuja. Last year [2015], 12 people died in Nigeria out of 375 infected, while in 2012 there were 1723 cases and 112 deaths, according to the NCDC. In neighbouring Benin at least 9 people have died in a Lassa outbreak, with a total of 20 suspected cases, health authorities said on Tuesday [2 Feb 2016].The number of Lassa fever infections across West Africa every year is between 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The disease belongs to the same family as Marburg and Ebola [This is not correct. Lassa fever virus is an arenavirus while the Ebola viruses and Marburg virus are filoviruses. - Mod.TY], 2 deadly viruses that lead to infections with fever, vomiting and, in worse case scenarios, haemorrhagic bleeding.Lassa's name is from the town of Lassa in northern Nigeria where it was 1st identified in 1969. Endemic to the region, Lassa fever is asymptomatic in 80 percent of cases but for others it can cause internal bleeding, especially when diagnosed late.The virus is spread through contact with food or household items contaminated with rats' urine or faeces or after coming in direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.[Byline: Tom Wuke] --Communicated by:Alimuddin Zumla <a.i.zumla@gmail.com>[The number of Lassa fever cases continues to mount in Nigeria. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety.The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures.Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. There has been no indication that a village-level control effort has been initiated yet.
