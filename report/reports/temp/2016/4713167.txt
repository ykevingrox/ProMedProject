The dead morgue attendant and physician and nurse who are in the hospital ICU are new cases. Apparently, use of personal protective equipment was not in use in the patient care facilities where these cases occurred. Ogun state may have been declared free of cases in the past 4 months, but the virus is likely present in reservoir rodents continually. - Mod.TY]
