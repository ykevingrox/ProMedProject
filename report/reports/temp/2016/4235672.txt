CBS 4 Denver [edited]<http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/05/19/man-dies-after-hantavirus-exposure-2nd-in-san-luis-valley-this-year/>Public health officials confirmed that a man from Rio Grande County [Colorado] who had been exposed to hantavirus has died. Co-workers told CBS4 on Wednesday [18 May 2016] that a local architect and philanthropist died after being diagnosed with [a] hantavirus [infection].The rare respiratory disease case is the 2nd in the San Luis Valley this year [2016]. A Saguache County [Colorado] resident died from hantavirus exposure last month [April 2016]. Their deaths have prompted warnings from local health officials about the virus. Another person exposed to the virus is recovering in Montrose County [Colorado].The illness [virus] is passed through exposure to deer mice or their droppings and nests.The disease kills several people every year in Colorado, according to Rio Grande County Public Health Director Emily Brown.""We want to remind our community to take precautions to reduce the chance of exposure to this virus,"" said Brown.Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say exposure to hantavirus can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a rare but serious disease that is fatal for more than 1/3rd of those people who become infected.Additional information from the CDC (<http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/>):Hantaviruses cannot spread from person to person [except for Andes virus in South America - Mod.TY]. People are infected by breathing in the virus when stirring up dust from mouse nests or mouse droppings in areas with poor ventilation, or when handling or being bitten by mice.People are at risk when going into closed spaces with rodent droppings, such as crawl spaces, attics, barns, outbuildings, and sheds, or when clearing wood piles where mouse droppings might be present.In the San Luis Valley, the hantavirus is carried by deer mice, which have tawny backs, white bellies, big eyes and big ears. Typically, 10 to 15 percent of deer mice are infected, and it is not possible to tell if a mouse has the virus just by looking at it. [Prevalence of Sin Nombre hantavirus infection in deer mice in the western USA varies from place to place, and from year to year. - Mod.TY] Rodents and household pets do not get sick from the virus.Symptoms of HPS:Symptoms usually start 1-6 weeks after exposure. Initial symptoms are fatigue, fever, and muscle aches. There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems such as nausea, vomiting, and chills. 4 to 10 days later, a dry cough and difficulty breathing may develop as the lungs fill with fluid. From this point, the illness can progress rapidly to respiratory failure or even death. Because the disease can progress rapidly, it is important to seek medical care immediately if you develop fever, headache, and muscle pain within 6 weeks of exposure to mice or their droppings.Reduce your risk:Keep mice away from areas where you live and work. Store human food, pet food, and bird seed in lidded containers or securely closing cabinets. Use traps baited with peanut butter to remove rodents from indoor areas. Keep garbage in tightly-covered cans. Plug all holes (dime-sized or larger) in walls and around pipes and vents, using steel wool or metal sheeting. Repair window screens and make sure weather-stripping is tight under all doors, including pet doors. Store hay, wood and equipment above ground at least 100 feet [30 m] from the house. Remove old cars, junk and brush piles from the yard.[Byline: Matt Kroschel]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The spring season often brings with it sporadic cases of hantavirus infections, as cabins and other buildings unused over the winter are opened up and cleaned. In the western USA, the virus responsible for these cases is Sin Nombre. The above report describes where deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_, the reservoir host of the virus) occur and nest, leading to exposure to the virus, as well as measures to avoid it. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate. Prompt medical attention is essential.An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.

Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.espectadordigital.cl/se-confirma-nuevo-caso-de-hanta-virus-en-nuble/>This afternoon [19 May 2016], a new case of a hantavirus infection was confirmed in Nuble province [Bio Bio region] that according to the Espectador Digital is a 59-year-old seasonal worker, resident of the Quilelto sector of the San Carlos community, who remains hospitalized in the intensive care unit in the Hospital ClÌ nico Herminda MartÌ n in ChillÌÁn.The patient was admitted this past Tuesday [17 May 2016] to the San Carlos Hospital with symptoms characteristic of this infection and after positive tests was immediately transferred to the Hospital ClÌ nico in ChillÌÁn where they indicated that his condition is stable, conscious and hemodynamically stable, connected to non-invasive ventilation, according to the latest medical report issued by the assistance center. So far in 2016, Nuble province has registered 4 cases of hantavirus infection, 66 percent of the infections [in the Bio Bio region]. The Bio Bio region now has 6 cases of hantavirus [infections] with just one fatality, which is a reduction from 2015, when there were 3 fatal cases.One of the situations that worries the Health SEREMI [regional ministerial administrative unit] is that the residences of the 3 most recent cases corresponds to an aggregation of the San Carlos and Coihueco communities, reporting that a team in Nuble is developing an action plan, given the situation in the area.[Byline: Wilson Ponce]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The conditions under which this man acquired his hantavirus infection are not given. The development of an action plan in the area suggests that there will be an epidemiological investigation of the area where these patients worked and resided.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Infections are acquired when people are exposed to virus-containing excreta from infected rodents. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/chilfung/chile_regions.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3678>. - Mod.TY]
