Dawn [edited]<http://www.dawn.com/news/1274160>A senior registrar of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH) [Bahawalpur, Punjab province] was put on ventilator after Karachi's Aga Khan Hospital laboratory reports confirmed Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus].The virus has been confirmed almost a fortnight [2 weeks] after Dr S went down with 'high-grade fever'.With somewhat similar symptoms and complications, Dr O, a house officer who works in the same ward under Dr S, also underwent tests in Karachi on Friday [29 Jul 2016] (the result is awaited).To allay the anxiety of the BVH staff and general public after the word about the disease got round, the Punjab government sought a report from health experts to devise a course of action.BVH Director Emergency Ward Dr Aamir Bokhari, while speaking to Dawn, confirmed Dr S's condition and the tests of Dr O. Dr Bokhari said the 2 doctors were presumed to have carried the viral infection from [a student nurse] of Lodhran [Punjab province] who underwent a surgery at the hospital's surgical ward No. 4 on 16 Jul [2016]. The student-nurse expired a day after the surgery, he said.Dr S, he figured out, suffered a fever attack soon afterwards and was initially thought to be suffering from dengue but lab tests proved negative. Dr S's family finally took him to the Aga Khan Hospital on 25 Jul [2016] where he underwent tests that declared him to be a patient of Congo virus.Dr Bokhari (the focal person) said Dr O assisted the senior surgeon in the nurse's operation and had undergone tests after his illness worsened.The confirmation of Congo virus panicked the BVH staff and 102 paramedics immediately underwent screening. Four employees including a professor, who worked with Dr S in the operation theatre, had been quarantined in a ward, he said.OFFICIAL RESPONSE: Adviser to Chief Minister on Health Khwaja Salman Rafique constituted a team of senior clinicians to assess the situation and furnish the department with a report, says a handout.At a meeting, the DG health informed the participants about the nurse's surgery and subsequent death and Dr S's ailment. He said an alert had been issued in Lodhran and Bahawalpur districts [Punjab province] and the health teams had quarantined all ""contacts"" of the nurse and the doctors. Moreover, medical teams of the World Health Organization and the health department are monitoring the situation, he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 29 Jul 2016Source: Express Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1152121/public-health-congo-virus-incidence-monitored-two-cases/>Advisor to Chief Minister on Health Khwaja Salman Rafiq has constituted a special team to submit a report on prevalence of Congo fever after 2 cases were reported from Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, the Health Department has issued directives to quarantine all people in close contact with 2 Bahawal Victoria Hospital doctors diagnosed with the disease and a student nurse who died while she was under treatment at BVH for abdominal pain.These decisions were taken at a meeting on Friday [29 Jul 2016]. The meeting was chaired by Rafiq. The meeting decided that those related to the 2 patients and the deceased nurse should be kept under surveillance for the incubation period of the virus to control the spread of the disease.Earlier, the health services DG informed the meeting that a student nurse from Lodhran's district headquarters (DHQ) hospital had undergone a surgery at BVH for a condition involving severe abdominal pain. He said the nurse had later died. Four days later, Dr S, who operated on the nurse, was admitted to a private hospital in Karachi with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever. He was later diagnosed with Congo fever. A house surgeon had also developed similar symptoms. The health services DG said that after confirmation of Congo fever in both cases, an alert was issued in Lodhran and Bahawalpur districts.He said teams comprising personnel from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Health Department were monitoring the situation. Blood samples had been sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad for laboratory examination, he added.The DG said directives had been issued for doctors and nurses to wear personal protective gear (PPG) available at all public hospitals.Rafiq directed the DG to remain vigilant and to ensure round-the-clock monitoring of the situation. He said the Health Department had approached the livestock department with a request to start an immediate campaign to eliminate ticks from cattle and livestock across the province. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Information on news reports were kindly forwarded by a doctor from Pakistan who wishes to remain anonymous. ProMED-mail thanks him for the support.As the above reports signify, CCHF poses a significant health risk to health care workers who come in contact with cases that do not present with hemorrhagic signs or symptoms as the index case came to Bahawalpur and underwent surgery, but the attending staff did not suspect or test the case for CCHF.Laboratory tests that are generally used to diagnose CCHF include antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus isolation attempts, and detection of antibody by ELISA (IgG and IgM). Laboratory diagnosis of a patient with a clinical history compatible with CCHF can be made during the acute phase of the disease by using the combination of detection of the viral antigen (ELISA antigen capture), viral RNA sequence (RT-PCR) in the blood or in tissues collected from a fatal case and virus isolation [<http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/diagnosis/>]. The diagnostic assays for CCHF are available in a handful of laboratories in Pakistan including National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad (public sector), and Agha Khan Laboratories (private).All samples collected during outbreaks are sent to NIH for confirmation.Any further information on the current outbreak will be highly appreciated from the concerned quarters.There are key elements that require addressal for this and other infectious disease alerts, including but not limited to:- Health care worker education and awareness, education on the prevalent infectious diseases- Implementation of strict infection control measures- Utilization of the available public health experts trained in field investigation and response such as the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory training program, and who are also available in Pakistan, which can help highlight the source of the outbreak and also support timely implementation of control measuresGuidelines on CCHF can be accessed on the NIH Pakistan website using the following link: <http://nih.org.pk/files/Guidelines/CCHF%20guidelines%20September%202013.pdf>.The CDC guidelines can be found at: <http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/index.html>. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/941>.]
