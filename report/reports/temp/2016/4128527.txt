UNICEF's website indicates, to address this situation, it has expedited delivery of much-needed medical supplies to the most affected areas. The latest situation is being exacerbated by the death of the 5th Ebola patient last Tue [22 Mar 2016] in southeast Guinea. This has triggered concerns of possible spread of an EVD recent flare-up.According to Fode Sylla Tass from the National Coordination of the Fight against Ebola in Guinea, the 5th man, whose identity is yet to be determined, recently went to Koropara where he is said to have had direct contact with EVD patients. Reportedly, the 5th victim was buried in Makoidou village, without traditional cleaning or performing sanitary interventions on the body. In the past, dead bodies, including those infected with EVD, were washed thoroughly prior to burial. However, washing infected bodies has become a significant medium of EVD transmission.According to reports, when the official declaration of EVD transmission was made by the government last week, UNICEF, in collaboration with the Guinean Ministry of Health, sent 5 metric tons [MT = 11 023 pounds] of equipment, including calcium hypochlorite, chlorine, gloves, raincoats, plastic mats, blankets, tarpaulins, and syringes to health workers and at-risk communities. UNICEF has also, so far, distributed 5500 boxes of liquid chlorine, 50 000 pieces of soap and chlorine powder to medical workers and communities in the affected areas. Rehydration fluids and oral rehydration salts have also been supplied to help with some of the symptoms of EVD.]28 Mar 2016 Bahamas, South Africa: Ebola scare after patient returns to Bahamas from South Africa<http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Ebola-scare-after-patient-returns-to-Bahamas-from-South-Africa>[According to Bahama health authorities, they are taking ""the necessary precautions"" and have, so far, ruled out a case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) following the hospitalization of a 51-year-old woman after a visit to South Africa earlier this month [March 2016]. The woman remains hospitalized at the Princess Margaret Hospital.  This shpws a woeful ignorance of geography by the authosototes in the Bahamas -- South Africa is thousanda of miles away from the Ebola-infected Westv African countries. - Mod.JW]29 Mar 2016: West Africa Ebola outbreak no longer poses global risk, WHO says (Reuters)<http://www.firstpost.com/world/west-africa-ebola-outbreak-no-longer-poses-global-risk-who-says-reuters-2702370.html>[On Tue [29 Mar 2016] the World Health Organization [WHO] declared the outbreak of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] is no longer a threat to international public health. This marks the end of an almost 20-month emergency which killed approximately 11 300 people. WHO also approved lifting any travel and trade restrictions affecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. While all original chains of virus transmission have ended, a new chain of transmission in Guinea has infected 8 people, including 7 who have died.][It is surprising that WHO approved lifting travel restrictions for Guinea when cases are still suspected.

Fang L, et al. (29 Mar 2016). Transmission dynamics of Ebola virus disease and intervention effectiveness in Sierra Leone, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2016). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1518587113A team of researchers from China, the U.S. and Sierra Leone has performed a postmortem on the Ebola outbreak that occurred during 2014/15 infecting approximately 8700 people in Sierra Leone and killing 3590 of them. In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe the large amount of data they were able to obtain, how they used it, what was learned, and how it showed that modern epidemic strategies can work even in the absence of a vaccine.The Ebola outbreak started across the border in Guinea, the team noted, with the 1st case in Sierra Leone found in May of 2014; it then spread, following roads, the data showed, to one of the country's major cities, Freetown. From there, it moved east to the central part of the country, infecting people along roadways and at health clinics as infected people moved there for help. But then, the government and international agencies mobilized and provided a means for curbing infections, mainly by teaching people to not touch infected people and those that had died of the disease. A program of safe burial was instigated, and health workers were given infection proof suits to allow them to work without themselves becoming infected and further spreading the disease. The result was immediately positive, the average number of people infected by a single infected person dropped 43 percent during the 1st month of implementation and 65 percent by the end of the following month.The team notes that information gathering during the epidemic was extraordinarily high, offering data down to the household level. That showed that during the worst part of the epidemic, the transmission rate was approximately 9 percent, which they note is comparable to the flu -- that finding was particularly alarming because Ebola is far less easily transmitted between people -- to get it, a person has to touch the body of someone infected, or their fluids, before or after they have died.The data show, the team reports, that the strategy of 100 percent isolation can be achieved and works to stop an Ebola epidemic. Sadly, it also showed that the time lag between initial infections and the implementation of the strategy allowed for the needless deaths of thousands of people.[Recommended reading. - Mod.LK]Vaccine---30 Mar 2016: Inovio's Ebola vaccine has positive results in early human trials<http://www.marketwatch.com/story/inovios-ebola-vaccine-has-positive-results-in-early-human-trials-2016-03-30>[According to Invovio Pharmaceutical, their Phase I study, which enrolled 75 healthy subjects, tested the vaccine against circulating Ebola strains from 1975 to 2014 and found the vaccine was tolerated well without any systemic serious adverse effects.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>.
