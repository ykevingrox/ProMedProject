Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/leptospirosis-kills-four-in-udupi-india-81524/>[According to a Times of India report, 4 deaths seen recently in Pethri (2), Iruvathoor, and Kundapur, have been attributed to leptospirosis, causing fear among the population in the Coastal Karnataka city [district] of Udupi.]Health officials are currently trying to ease the tension among the public by creating awareness programs about the bacterial disease. Leptospirosis is caused by a corkscrew-shaped bacterium called _Leptospira interrogans_, is often referred to as ""rat fever"" due to the principal role rats play in spreading the disease (scientists refer this type of animal as a reservoir host). Other animals can also be important reservoirs of the disease. These animals can spread the disease in their urine, contaminating water, soil, or food. People who live in close contact with domestic animals or wildlife are at higher risk for getting the disease.People become infected by coming into contact with contaminated urine, water, food, or soil through breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose. Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to contaminated water, such as floodwaters. Person to person transmission is rare. Infected individuals initially experience fever, severe headache and muscle aches, abdominal pain, and occasionally a skin rash. Patients in the later stages of disease can suffer from jaundice, kidney failure, bleeding from the mouth or nose, bloody urine and can be fatal, especially without proper treatment.[Byline: Robert Herriman}--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Karnataka, originally known as Mysore, is a state in southwestern India.
