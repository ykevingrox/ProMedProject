New Carlisle News [edited]<http://www.newcarlislenews.net/index.php/local-government/clark-county/2080-clark-county-mosquito-trappings-reveals-the-aedes-albopictus-in-the-area>Sanitarians for the Clark County Combined Health District (CCCHD) have found the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in Springfield and Clark County area. The _Aedes albopictus_ may potentially transmit Zika virus, although it has not yet been implicated in the transmission of human cases in Ohio.CCCHD Sanitarians have been working with the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) since June of this year [2016] to trap mosquitos. 2-3 times a week traps are set up in various areas of Clark County and Springfield. The mosquitos are then collected and sent to ODH to be identified and tested for West Nile [virus]. This specific mosquito has been identified in 2 locations in Green Township and 3 locations within the City of Springfield.This is a reminder for the citizens that as the weather becomes cooler it is still important to protect you and your family from mosquitos. Until the 1st freeze hits we are still at risk and need to continue protecting ourselves.The best way to avoid Zika virus infection and other mosquito-borne diseases is to prevent mosquito bites:- When outdoors, wear Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered insect repellents. All EPA registered insect repellents have been evaluated for effectiveness. Always follow the product label instructions.- Unlike many mosquitos, the Asian tiger mosquitos are most active during the day and are most common in shade conditions. Be sure to use insect repellent and wear long sleeves and pants where these mosquitoes are active.- Make sure you have good screens on your windows and doors to keep mosquitos out.- Yellow fever mosquitos and Asian tiger mosquitos are both container breeding mosquitos. They do not breed in ponds, puddles or marshes. Remove their breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets and barrels. Change the water in pet dishes, and replace the water in bird baths every other day. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Keep children's wading pools empty and on their sides when they aren't being used.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report again illustrates the capacity this mosquito has to appear in new places. However, the mosquitoes have little time -- 2-3 weeks -- until the 1st killing frosts of autumn occur which will eliminate them. Finding _Aedes albopictus_ in Ohio is not surprising. CDC's map of geographic areas suitable for this mosquito includes all of this state (<http://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/range.html>). - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237>.]
