KBS World [edited]<http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Dm_detail.htm?No=118285>The 1st case of a deadly tickborne virus in South Korea this year [2016] has been confirmed on Jeju Island. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that a 61 year old man contracted the virus and suffered severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) on [Tue 12 Apr 2016]. The man was bitten by a tick on [27 Mar 2016] and displayed a common SFTS symptom of high fever earlier this month [April 2016]. The CDC urged extra caution to prevent from being bitten [by ticks] while engaging in outdoor activities, and recommends wearing long sleeves, avoiding direct skin contact with grass, and to take a shower after returning home. SFTS is transmitted by ticks and has an incubation period of 1-2 weeks. Those infected with the virus experience cold-like symptoms, including fever and body aches. In 2013, 36 cases were reported, and 17 people died from the virus. The number of SFTS cases increased to 55 in 2014 and 79 last year [2015].--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Dan Silver[One hopes that the warnings issued by the Korean CDC for avoidance to tick bites is heeded, so that the number of SFTS cases and deaths is less than last year (2015).Mod.JW's commentary in a ProMED-mail post dated 26 Feb 2014 (archive no 20140301.2308402) stated, ""SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. It was first isolated in China from samples from fever patients in 2009 and has since been detected in Japan and South Korea. The vector was found to be ticks.""'The tick that carries the virus in question, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago,' said Oh Myeong-don, a doctor of infectious disease and internal medicine at Seoul National University Hospital. 'A lot of research has been conducted into the issue in China. The reason the media was reporting that the mortality rate of the disease was 30 per cent is that at first, they were only able to find the most serious cases. But now, reports have also been made of people who recovered on their own after being infected and people who only had mild symptoms, which has brought the mortality rate down to 6 per cent,' Oh said. 'While there is no reason to be overly concerned about the disease, it is still a good idea to make sure you don't get bitten by ticks.'
