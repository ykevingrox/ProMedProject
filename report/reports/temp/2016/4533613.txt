Odisha Sun Times [edited]<http://odishasuntimes.com/2016/10/02/two-more-kids-die-of-japanese-encephalitis-in-odisha-toll-rises-to-23/>With Japanese Encephalitis taking epidemic proportions, the vector-borne disease has claimed 3 more lives in Odisha's Malkangiri taking the toll to 24. According to reports, 24 infants have died in the last 24 days and 5 have died in last 4 days.While 2 infants died yesterday, 1 died at Malkangiri district headquarters hospital today [2 Oct 2016].The disease has assumed epidemic proportions in 2 blocks-- Kalimela and Korukonda.A 4-member medical team from MKCG Medical College and Hospital was camping at the affected villages to treat patients. Besides, the district administration has intensified mosquito eradication and cleaning programmes in the affected areas to control the spread of the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of children dying of encephalitis in the district continues to increase from 14 reported on 26 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160927.4517725) to 19 on 29 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160929.4525723) and now to 24 in the above report with an epidemic mentioned in 2 blocks. Previous reports from this area indicate that apparently some of these deaths are confirmed as due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infections and the remainder are suspected to be due to the virus also, but some reports also mention acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), without indicating specific etiologies.Curiously, mosquito eradication is mentioned but not vaccination. Mosquito control, at least temporarily, may be possible (but difficult) but eradication is not possible with current technology. Vaccine is available and is the most reliable approach to prevention of additional cases. The virus is actively transmitted in this area. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts of JE virus, mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors, and pigs are amplifying hosts.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>.]
