The New Indian Express, Express News Service [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Japanese-Encephalitis-scare-in-Malkangiri/2016/09/26/article3630105.ece>Death of 14 children, aged between 2 and 15, in one fortnight in Malkangiri district [Odisha] has put the health authorities on tenterhooks. While it is suspected that the children might have died in Japanese encephalitis (JE), health officials claimed they were suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).The deaths have been reported from Kalimela, Pandripani, and Korkunda blocks of the district, which had first witnessed the incidence of AES and JE in 2012. At least 4 children have died in Koimetla village in one week spreading panic among the residents.Sources said of the 15 children who were undergoing treatment in district headquarters hospital (DHH), 6 have been shifted to MKCG Medical College and Hospital at Berhampur. The children showed symptoms of AES like fever, vomiting, and fatigue.Hospital authorities have started precautionary measures to check the menace. Blood samples of these children have been sent to Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) for tests to ascertain whether they were infected by JE.Meanwhile, a team of health officials has visited the affected villages in 3 blocks of the tribal-dominated district. The team comprised Director (Public Health) Dr Kailas Chandra Dash, Joint Director of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr MM Pradhan and experts from Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI).Deputy Director of NVBDCP Dr Rajendra Mallick said population in the affected villages belonged to tribal communities with low socio-economic status who lived on cultivation and daily wages. ""They live in unhygienic condition and raise pigs which are major carrier [amplifier] of the virus,"" he said.The outbreak of AES and JE usually coincides with the monsoon and post-monsoon period when the density of mosquitoes increases. As precautionary measure, awareness drive as well as measures to curb mosquito menace has been started in all affected areas of the district.Paddy fields close to houses, high pig to cattle ratio, high density of _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes, low socio-economic status, and low health awareness in tribal population have been cited as reasons behind the spurt in AES cases.Dr Mallick said house-to-house survey was undertaken to record the suspected cases and information on clinical presentations. ""The blood samples have also been collected by the ADRI team. The reports are awaited,"" he added.Sudden deaths in children due to AES were first reported in the district during September-November 2012 when 272 suspected cases with 24 deaths were observed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Apparently, some of these deaths are suspected to be due to JE, but health official attributed them to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The report goes on to describe the importance of _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes and pigs -- all key actors in the transmission of JE virus. Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) occur frequently each year in this part of north eastern India.Unfortunately, AES is an imprecise category and includes JE and other possible but unconfirmed etiologies. As noted in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts of JE virus and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/994; maps of Odisha State, India at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]
