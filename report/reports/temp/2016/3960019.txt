Fox 8 News [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/01/22/12-year-old-washington-girl-dies-from-flu.html>The family of a 12 year old girl who died after contracting the flu said her illness progressed like ""a freight train"".The [girl's mother], of Kitsap County, Washington, described her daughter as a usually very healthy child, according to Fox 8. On Tuesday [12 Jan 2016], the girl presented a high fever, and her family took her to the doctor, who prescribed her Tamiflu [oseltamivir]. The girl would see the doctor 2 more times before being told to go to the hospital if symptoms did not improve.""She continued to have high fevers just like me; it was horrible."" The mother told Fox 8 that her daughter began vomiting blood, and as they were on their way to the hospital, her daughter collapsed in her arms. ""Her legs were spaghetti noodles,"" [said the mother]. ""It just went that way, and she said, 'Oh momma,' and she collapsed in my arms.""Doctors were unable to revive her. ""The flu attacked her kidneys, so it caused renal failure. ... They let me lay there and hold her for hours, and they were so kind to us.""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been only 7 pediatric flu deaths nationwide since 4 Oct 2015, when the CDC began tracking the flu for this season.This child is the 2nd person to die from complications from the flu this season in Kitsap County. Officials are urging others in the community to get vaccinated.[submitted by: <memphisservices@bellsouth.net>]--communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[This tragic case is an unfortunate reminder that vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all children over 6 months of age. Approximately 90 per cent of cases occur in children who have not received a flu vaccination.Excerpted from <http://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/children-flu-deaths.htm> [edited]:CDC began tracking flu-associated pediatric deaths [that is, in those under 18 years of age] after the 2003-2004 flu season -- a season that started early and was intense. In addition, it took a high toll on children. In the 2003-2004 season, 153 pediatric deaths were reported to CDC from 40 states. Flu-associated pediatric deaths became nationally reportable the following season. Since that time, reported pediatric deaths during regular influenza seasons have ranged from 35 (in 2011-2012) to 122 (in 2010-2011). However, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which lasted from 15 Apr 2009 to 2 Oct 2010, 348 pediatric deaths were reported to CDC.A map of Washington state in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Eastern Europe: H1N1 increase in casesDate: Thu 21 Jan 2016Source: Euronews [edited]<http://www.euronews.com/2016/01/21/eighteen-people-die-in-armenia-three-in-georgia-from-h1n1-swine-flu>Influenza (H1N1) in eastern Europe claiming lives, many cases in hospital-------------------------------------------------------------------------H1N1 swine flu: a new pandemic on the way?------------------------------------------An outbreak of swine flu in eastern Europe is claiming lives and causing a stir in the media. A major H1N1 outbreak sparked a World Health Organization pandemic alert in June 2009, after the virus emerged from Mexico and the United States. The outbreak killed around 18 500 people in 214 countries. The alert was lifted in August 2010. Since then bird flu has become a pressing preoccupation, but swine flu has the potential to be a global killer. So should we be worried?Armenia has reported 18 deaths, with neighbouring Georgia 3, but both countries say the victims had complications and sought treatment far too late, and there is no question of an epidemic.In Russia at least 17 people have died and hundreds have been hospitalised, and Ukraine says there have been 50 deaths there, with the flu virus especially rampant in the Russian-occupied east of the country.Iran says the virus is also claiming lives there in the country's 1st ever large outbreak of the H1N1 strain. At least 112 people have died, concentrated in the south east of the country.The health authorities in India have embarked on a big public awareness campaign following a 2nd death from the disease. Swine flu is of special concern in India, with its dense urban populations and poor sanitation.Of course seasonal influenza occurs every year and the viruses change each year, and many people have some immunity to the circulating virus that helps limit infections. Some countries also use seasonal influenza vaccines to reduce illness and deaths.By contrast, the H1N1 was a new virus when it emerged and most people had no or little immunity to it, giving it pandemic potential. One of the lessons from history is that influenza pandemics can kill millions, and there was no pandemic influenza vaccine at the outset.Now H1N1 treatments have been developed but their effectiveness has been questioned, hence the media panic at any sign that it may be making a comeback. If you think you may be at risk, or want to know more about the disease, the World Health Organization has prepared a factsheet [<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/about_disease/en/>].[byline: Robert Hackwill]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A reminder that ""swine"" flu is actually seasonal flu that is transmitted from person to person as easily as the normal seasonal flu and can be passed among people by exposure to infected droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing. These droplets are inhaled, or alternatively may contaminate hands or surfaces. Most countries in the world have confirmed infections from H1N1.Unlike typical seasonal flu patterns, this virus causes high levels of summer infections in the northern hemisphere, and then even higher levels of activity during cooler months in this part of the world. The majority of people with pandemic influenza experience mild illness and recover fully without treatment.A map showing eastern Europe can be accessed at <https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zqh6TmzOjEbs.kwLYxEHV9x7g&hl=en>. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22814>.]
