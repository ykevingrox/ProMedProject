United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [edited]<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2016/recall-007-2016-release>Snapp's Ferry Packing Company, an Afton, TN establishment, is recalling approximately 410 pounds of beef product that may be contaminated with _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 20 Jan 2016. The ground beef item was produced on 20 Nov 2015. The following product is subject to recall: 5-lb. packages of ""Ground Beef"", with a packaging date of 20 Nov 2015.The product subject to recall bears establishment number ""Est. 9085"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The item was distributed to restaurants in the Knoxville, Tenn. area. None of this product was sold at retail.The problem was discovered on 19 Jan 2016, when a positive result for _E. coli_ O157:H7 from FSIS testing was traced back to the establishment as a result of an ongoing illness investigation in Tennessee. FSIS is continuing to work with our public health partners at the Tennessee Department of Health and Knox County Health Department on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available._E. coli_ O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2-8 days (3-4 days, on average) after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at <http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls>.FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F [71 C]. The only way to confirm that ground and boneless beef products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Ground beef is, of course, the prototypic reservoir for enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, which can also be spread by a variety of other food stuffs, water exposures and direct animal contact, among others.The organism literally burst on the microbial scene with the outbreak related to a chain of fast food establishments in the USA and was reported in 1983:Riley LW, Remis RS, Helgerson SD, et al. Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare Escherichia coli serotype. N Engl J Med. 1983; 308: 681-5.Abstract""We investigated 2 outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P less than 0.005) and Michigan (P = 0.0005) and with eating any of three sandwiches containing three ingredients in common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype, O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9 of 12 stools collected within 4 days of onset of illness in both outbreaks combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive gastrointestinal illness associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, apparently transmitted by undercooked meat."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/244>.]
