The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 8. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2016] in Paktika province, close to the border with Pakistan.- No WPV1 environmental positive samples have been reported in 2016. The most recent samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] - 1 in Jalalabad district of Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.- Efforts continue to further strengthen immunization and surveillance activities across the country.Pakistan- One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the past week, from Sujawal, Sindh (south east of Karachi), with onset of paralysis on [3 Sep 2016]. It is the most recent case in the country, and brings the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 15.- One new WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, from Peshawar (date of collection: [15 Sep 2016]). Continued detection of environmental positives throughout 2016 confirms that virus transmission remains geographically widespread across the country, despite strong improvements being achieved.- Efforts continue to further strengthen immunization and surveillance activities in all provinces of the country.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3 in 2016 and 8 in 2015.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.Madagascar- More than 1 year has passed since the most recent circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type one (cVDPV1) case, which had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015], from Sud-Ouest region. No cases of cVDPV1 have been reported in 2016. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 is 10.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for [9-11 Nov 2016] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV).Myanmar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case was isolated from a 16 month old child in Maungdaw district of Rakhine state, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 is 2.- An outbreak response assessment was conducted in September [2016], and found substantial improvements both in surveillance and subnational immunity levels. Although some gaps remain, it is likely that transmission of this strain has been successfully interrupted.Nigeria- One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 4. It is the most recent case in the country, with onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016], from Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno, a previously-infected district.- The detection of new cases at this stage of the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected; it is an indicator that surveillance continues to be strengthened. It is not an indication that the current outbreak response is not effective, as it is too early to see an impact on the epidemiology of the virus circulation. This latest case had onset of paralysis in August [2016], before the outbreak response began.- Regional outbreak response in north eastern Nigeria continues to be implemented, both in response to the WPV1 cases detected in August [2016] and to the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates, detected in Borno from an environmental sample (collected in March [2016]) and a healthy contact of 1 of the WPV1 cases (from August [2016]).- The emergency regional outbreak response is being implemented under the guidance of the Polio Eradication Emergency Operations Center (EOC), led by the Government of Nigeria and with support from WHO and GPEI partners. The outbreak response is being coordinated with neighbouring countries and in the broader humanitarian emergency response context affecting the region. Similar approaches to outbreak response were successfully implemented in previous years in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.Lake Chad sub-region- The recent detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Borno state, Nigeria, poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad sub-region and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Health leaders at last month's [September 2016] Regional Committee for Africa declared the situation to be a regional public health emergency for the Lake Chad sub-region.- Regional emergency outbreak response is continuing across the Lake Chad sub-region.West Africa- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is 7.- While progress in Guinea continues to be achieved, gaps remain sub-nationally both in population immunity and surveillance sensitivity. Undetected circulation cannot be ruled out. Efforts are continuing to rapidly fill these gaps and ensure the outbreak has been fully stopped.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are being conducted at the end of the month [October 2016] in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Liberia and Sierra Leone are considered at particular risk of polio re-infection or emergence, including by potential spread of cVDPV from Guinea or WPV from Nigeria. Significant subnational immunity and surveillance gaps remain, following significant decline in health systems capacity as a result of the Ebola outbreak.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is a pity this update wasn't available at the time of preparation of yesterday's [12 Oct 2016] update (see Poliomyelitis update (17): Afghanistan (PK), Liberia (NI) susp, RFI 20161013.4556033). In the above global update, the number of reported cases of polio in Afghanistan this year [2016] is corrected to 8 (whereas in a previous update it was listed as 9).An interesting new fact in the above update is the inclusion of information on a new case of WPV1 reported by Nigeria, although no mention of the cVDPV reported in a previous ProMED-mail update, with information from a WHO Disease Outbreak News report (see Poliomyelitis update (16): Pakistan (SD), Nigeria (BO), WHO 20161009.4547447). This now brings the total number of WPV1 cases confirmed in Borno Nigeria to 4.In yesterday's ProMED-mail poliomyelitis update, there was a media report of identification of 6 suspected cases of paralytic polio in Liberia. Today's global update by the Polio Eradication Initiative makes no mention of these cases, nor are there additional media reports on these suspected cases. Hence, we still do not know if these will be classified as non-polio AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases, cases of paralytic disease attributable to WPV or cases attributable to cVDPV, or a mix of these.For a map showing the locations of WPV and cVDPV associated cases reported in 2016 and 2015, see <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/137>.]
