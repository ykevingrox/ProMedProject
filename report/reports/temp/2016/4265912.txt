The pictures of patients with severe spasticity, muscle wasting and cognitive impairment were unforgettable.The current situation in Peru raises the specter of this neurological disaster for children of mothers currently exposed. Unfortunately, this toxin crosses the placenta. I fear health administrators in Peru are looking at a multigenerational disease burden.See: Sci Total Environ. 2009 Dec 20;408(2):272-6. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.011. Epub 2009 Oct 29.--Leslie Jabine, MDAssistant Clinical ProfessorDivision of General Internal MedicineDivision of General PediatricsThe University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System<ljabine@uic.edu>[Minamata disease (M. d.) is methylmercury (MeHg) poisoning that occurred in humans who ingested fish and shellfish contaminated by MeHg discharged in waste water from a chemical plant (Chisso Co. Ltd.). It was in May 1956 that M. d. was 1st officially ""discovered"" in Minamata City, south-west region of Japan's Kyushu Island. The cats on the dock that ate the fish waste were the 1st to show clinical signs of MeHg poisoning. It was the veterinarians who 1st recognized the situation in the cats, and in turn human beings were diagnosed.The marine products in Minamata Bay displayed high levels of Hg contamination (5.61 to 35.7 ppm). The Hg content in hair of patients, their family and inhabitants of the Shiranui Sea coastline were also detected at high levels of Hg (max. 705 ppm). Typical symptoms of M. d. are as follows: sensory disturbances (glove and stocking type), ataxia, dysarthria, constriction of the visual field, auditory disturbances and tremor were also seen. Further, the fetus was poisoned by MeHg when their mothers ingested contaminated marine life (named congenital M. d.). The symptom of patients were serious, and extensive lesions of the brain were observed. While the number of grave cases with acute M. d. in the initial stage was decreasing, the numbers of chronic M. d. patients who manifested symptoms gradually over an extended period of time was on the increase. For the past 36 years, of the 2252 patients who have been officially recognized as having M. d., 1043 have died.In the previous ProMED-mail report 20160603.4264224, the statement below, and the data from Japan, clearly indicate that children are at risk, babies are at risk, as is the whole population, consuming fish on a regular basis.""The presence of mercury in human hair generally indicates that a person has been exposed to the metal through a dietary source. Pan says that the Duke studies in Madre de Dios show a strong correlation between human mercury exposure and fish consumption. Since 2009, studies by Pan's group [1], and by tropical ecologist Luis Fernandez at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University in California [USA], have found high mercury levels in some species of fish, particularly large catfish and in fish that eat other fish.""Portions of this comment were extracted from:Minamata disease: methylmercury poisoning in Japan caused by environmental pollution.
