Backtracking reports, on 29 Nov 2015, there was a 35-year-old Saudi female from Buraidah reported as a newly confirmed case, classified as a primary case (though no mention of history of contact with camels), who was later reported as a fatality on 5 Dec 2015. On 16 Dec 2016, there was a 41-year-old expat female healthcare worker from Buraidah reported as a newly confirmed healthcare associated case, associated with contact with the earlier reported case. Fast forward, there was a 40-year-old Saudi male from Buraidah who was reported as a newly confirmed case on 3 Mar 2016, classified as a primary case, but no history of contact with camels, who was later reported as a fatality on 4 Mar 2016. Then on 4 Mar 2016, there was a 67-year-old Saudi female from Buraidah who was reported as a newly confirmed case, also classified as a primary case, but no history of contact with camels, who was later reported as a fatality on 6 Mar 2014. On 5 Mar 2016, there were 3 newly confirmed cases reported from Buraidah, all 3 with classifications noted to be under investigation.As of today, 9 Mar 2016, if one counts this nosocomial outbreak as having begun around 3 Mar 2016, there have been a total of 14 cases reported from Buraidah, including 4 deaths and 2 healthcare workers. Curiously, though, the 1st 2 cases were reported as primary cases without a history of contact with camels, and the next 4 cases were reported as ""classification under investigation"".So if one wants to be a devil's advocate, one might speculate that the index case in this outbreak was reported on 29 Nov 2015 (although as a female the likelihood of direct contact with camels is not considered to be high), followed by a 2nd case reported on 16 Dec 2015 in a healthcare worker caring for her. Then, perhaps there has been slow but undetected transmission of the virus in the community until early March 2016 when there were 14 newly confirmed cases reported during a one-week period, 3-9 Mar 2016.We await more information from epidemiologic investigations surrounding this outbreak.Buraidah is the capital of the Al-Qassim region, located in the north central part of the country. The region neighbors with the Riyadh region. It is a predominantly agricultural region known for growing dates, citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges, and for wheat production.Interestingly, there was one newly confirmed case reported from Alzulfi, which while situated in Riyadh province, is closer to Buraidah than Riyadh city -- approximately 100 km (60 miles) by road from Buraidah.A map showing the location of the newly reported case can be found at the source URL.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia is available at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
