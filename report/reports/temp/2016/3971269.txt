However, in spring of 2013, China began reporting infections with the virus in people. Most of these infections have been associated with contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets) in China.According to the World Health Organization, 667 cases and 229 deaths from H7N9 flu have been reported globally from March 2013 through 14 Oct 2015, most from the mainland of China. <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/avian-flu-h7n9-china>Avian influenza A (H5N6) emerged in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6. There have not been very many human cases reported, but a slight increase has been reported in Guangdong since the end of 2015.Concern over the increase in human avian flu cases is exacerbated by the fast-approaching Lunar New Year (8 Feb 2016) celebrations, a time when poultry sales pick up and illnesses have historically climbed.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned travelers to avoid touching birds, pigs, or other animals and to avoid farms and poultry markets.Maps of China can be found at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5695>. - Mod.LK]
