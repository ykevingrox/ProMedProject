The Day [edited]<http://www.theday.com/statenortheast/20160222/tests-show-more-ticks-carrying-lyme-disease-bacteria>Thirty-one percent of blacklegged ticks submitted to the Tick Testing Laboratory at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station tested positive for the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, _Borrelia burgdorferi_.The experiment station said [Mon 22 Feb 2016] that this is an increase of nearly 6 percent from an average of 26 percent over the last 5 years of testing from 2010 to 2014. This is the statewide average for more than 2400 ticks tested from the state's 8 counties.In New London County, 33 percent of ticks tested carried the Lyme disease bacteria, the experiment station said in a news release.Last year [2015], the tick testing program, begun in 1990, was expanded to test for 2 emerging pathogens carried by ticks: _Babesia microti_, the agent for babesiosis; and anaplasmosis [_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_], which causes anaplasmosis. Statewide, 11 percent of ticks tested carried the babesiosis parasite, while 4.9 percent carried the anaplasmosis bacteria. About 8.5 percent of the ticks tested from New London County carried the babesiosis parasite, and 5.1 percent carried anaplasmosis bacteria.The experiment station said some ticks tested positive for 2 or all 3 pathogens, carrying an increased risk to human health.""The tick testing results highlight the growing risk of existing and emerging human infection with tick-associated diseases throughout the state and the importance of taking precautionary measures to avoid tick bites,"" Theodore Andreadis, director of the experiment station, said.Overall, more than 40 percent of all the ticks tested are infected with at least one of the agents capable of causing human infection, the experiment station said.From 2010 to 2014, there were 13 983 human cases of Lyme disease reported in Connecticut, and 659 cases of babesiosis, and 286 cases of anaplasmosis were reported in the state, the experiment station said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report above does not say whether the ticks examined were nymph or adult. The risk of human illness after being bitten is highest for an infected nymph seeking a blood meal, rather than an adult tick, because adult ticks are much larger and may more likely be removed before they have had time to transmit the organism. The prevalence of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ in nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 percent and 40 percent in areas of endemicity in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern United States (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>). The prevalence of coinfection in nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks with _Borrelia burgdorferi_, _Babesia microti_, or _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ has been discussed in prior ProMED-mail post (Lyme disease - USA (03): (NY) B. burgdorferi, B. microti coinfection in ticks 20140625.2563150, Lyme disease - USA (03): (NY) B. burgdorferi, B. microti coinfection in ticks 20140625.2563150, Lyme disease - Canada (02): (ON) B. burgdorferi prevalence in ticks 20140509.2461398, and Lyme disease - UK: Borrelia positive ticks 20120128.1024838).Connecticut, with an estimated population of almost 3.6 million inhabitants in 2015, is the southernmost state in the New England region (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut>). It is south of Massachusetts, east of New York, and north of the Long Island Sound. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/210>.]
