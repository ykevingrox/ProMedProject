Kenneth Dardick MD <kdardick@dardick.com>re: ProMED-mail Tick-induced mammalian meat allergy 20161011.4550782----------------------------------------------------------------This posting needs some clarification.It is not all ticks, but only certain ticks which are associated with the galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose hypersensitivity (alpha gal) reaction. Ticks for which the association has been established include _Amblyomma americanum_ (found widely in the south eastern United States), _Ixodes ricinus_ (found in Europe), and _Ixodes holocyclus_ (found in Australia). No clear association exists for tick bites from _Ixodes scapularis_ or _Ixodes pacificus_ (the vectors for Lyme disease).--communicated by:Kenneth Dardick MDStorrs, Connecticut<kdardick@dardick.com>[I appreciate Dr Dardick's message providing clarification. At this point in time, what we know of the alpha-gal reaction is that it is only associated with some ticks, as he has noted. Either the others do not produce the allergy, or we have not found the same response thus far. - Mod.TG]
