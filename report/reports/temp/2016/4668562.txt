Front Page Africa [edited]<http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/health/2664-strange-skin-disease-spreads-in-west-point-slum-community>Green Planet Discoveries has alarmed with serious concern over an outbreak of rash skin disease spreading in West Point and other parts of Monrovia. ""As we see it, the occurrence of this situation is occasioned by unhealthy environmental concerns,"" the group said.According to the group, about 15 persons were discovered with the rash in West Point and some parts of Brewerville. [A picture of the rash is available at the source URL above.]Green Planet Discoveries has therefore called on all those affected by the disease to seek urgent medical attention or avoid touching or playing with affected areas of the body.They've also advised affected persons to clean affected bodily areas with warm water and soap and if available, apply hand sanitizer to the affected area.""We also call on other individuals not yet affected to watch out for signs and symptoms of such disease, occurring with elevated yellowish area and red base on the skin, being quite painful to touch. It is also important that we clean our surrounding and relentlessly wash our hands [for] 45 seconds or one minute,"" the group urged.They called on the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, other non-governmental organizations working in the children and health sectors and parents to quickly look into the situation before it goes viral. The Ministry of Health is yet to comment on the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The skin rash that is occurring in 15 people is described as an elevated yellowish area with a red base and being quite painful to touch. Fever, the areas of the body involved, whether the rash is itchy, or age of the people involved are not mentioned as clinical findings. 3 non-febrile possibilities include scabies, impetigo, and ringworm. Scabies is an intensely itchy, contagious rash caused by an infestation with mites (_Sarcoptes scabiei_) that burrow into the upper layer of skin. Scabies is transmitted person-to-person by direct skin-to-skin contact. Small red papules, blisters, and red burrows appear on the wrists, between the fingers and toes, arms, and on skin covered by clothes. Scabies can spread in crowded places like childcare facilities.Impetigo also is a highly contagious skin infection caused by group A streptococci or _Staphylococcus aureus_. An itchy red, crusted rash on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, spreads to the rest of the body. Impetigo mainly affects infants and children.Ringworm is a common skin infection caused by fungi (species of _Trichophyton_, _Microsporum_, and _Epidermophyton_) that live on skin and surfaces such as clothing, towels, and bedding. It is acquired by contact with someone who has ringworm or with contaminated surfaces. Ringworm appears as a circular red, scaly, itchy rash that is associated with bald spots when it occurs on the scalp.There may be multiple etiologic agents at play that include, in addition to the above, contact dermatitis, allergies, eczema, and scratching induced by witnessing others with rashes.ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information from knowledgeable sources about this outbreak.Maps of Liberia can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/liberia/li2r765a/liberia_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6529>.West Point, a densely populated slums with a population of 75 000 residents, is a township of the Liberian capital city of Monrovia, located on a peninsula which juts out into the Atlantic Ocean (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point,_Monrovia>). Because the area lacks proper sanitation, public defecation is said to be common and the beach surrounding West Point is often used as a lavatory (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point,_Monrovia>). Many were made homeless when their housing was destroyed in May and June 2016 by coastal erosion (<http://www.emansion.gov.lr/2press.php?news_id=3645&related=7&pg=sp>, <http://allafrica.com/stories/201606071045.html>). - Mod.ML]
