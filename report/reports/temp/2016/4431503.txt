BBC [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37148958>Twelve districts of Greece have banned blood donations because of malaria, with 4 cases this year [2016] contracted domestically, local media reports.In the 61 other cases recorded, the sufferers became infected on the Indian subcontinent and African states, where the disease is endemic.The districts affected stretch from the Peloponnese to Thessaloniki.Domestic cases were 1st reported 4 years ago, nearly 4 decades after the disease was wiped out in Greece. Budget cuts saw municipal spraying schemes to combat mosquito-borne diseases being cut back.The Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) and the National Centre for Blood Donation both issued warnings, according to Greek news sites Kathimerini and Iefimerida (in Greek).The 12 districts affected are Farkadona, Trikala, Palamas, Tempe, Achaean and Thebes (central Greece); Evrotas and Andravida-Kyllini (Peloponnesus); Chalcis (Euboea); Marathon (Attica); and Lagada and Pylaia (Thessaloniki region).According to KEELPNO data, 65 cases of malaria had been detected in Greece this year [2016] as of mid-August 2016, compared to 85 for the whole of last year [2015]:4 cases involved infection inside Greece;50 cases were among immigrants from the Indian subcontinent or seven African states;11 cases involved travellers returning from malaria-affected countries.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: 21 Aug 2016From: EpiCore Surveillance Project memberDuring 2016, transmission of P. vivax was confirmed in 4 people residing in Greece, without previous travelling history (61 more malaria cases were imported).Specifically, [through 11 Aug 2016] these were:- one patient exposed possibly at the regional unit of Achaia (Peloponnese)-Municipality of Western Achaia, with onset of signs during the 26th week of 2016.- one patient exposed possibly at the regional unit of Ilea (Peloponnese)-Municipality of Andravida-Kyllini, with onset of signs during the 29th week of 2016.- two patients exposed possibly at the regional unit of Thessaloniki (Central Macedonia)-Municipality of Langkadas, with onset of signs during the 29th week of 2016.--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project member[ProMED-mail would like to thank the EpiCore Surveillance Project member for the rapid reply to an RFI for more information on the situation in Greece. (so rapid that we were able to include it in the pending post). A map showing the regions of Greece can be found at <http://www.in2greece.com/blog/2007/10/MAP_OF_GREECE.png>.  Achaia and Ilea are neighboring regional units whereas Thessaloniki is to the northeast, significantly separated from the Peloponnese. - Mod.MPPGreece was declared free of malaria in 1972. Authothonous cases were diagnosed in 2009 and peaked in 2011, when 42 cases were diagnosed with no travel history. The annual number of cases provided by the Greek Ministry of Health are:2009: 7; 2010: 4; 2011: 42; 2012: 20; 2013: 3; 2014: 0; 2015: 1 (up to 25 Aug 2016 (<http://www.keelpno.gr/Portals/0/Files/English%20files/Malaria%20reports/Malaria_report_26_08_2015.pdf>).The new 4 cases probably show that not all carriers have been identified and treated.It is important to know that _P. vivax_ exists in 2 forms: a tropical form with a short incubation period and a temperate climate form with an incubation period of up to a year (Review: White NJ. Determinants of relapse periodicity in _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria. Malaria J 2011;10:97).  The 2 forms of _P. vivax_ can be separated by haplotype analysis (Miao M et al. BMC Evol Biol. 2012;12:22).It is of key importance to know which type the new cases are to determine whether they have a recent infection (tropical form of _P. vivax_) or could have been infected up to a year ago (temperate form of _P. vivax_). To my knowledge, this analysis has not been performed on the previous cases. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/83>.]
