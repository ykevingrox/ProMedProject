20 minutos [in Spanish, trans. LK, edited]<http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2682156/0/supervivientes-ebola-sufren-sintomas-cerebral>A study by the American Academy of Neurology, which will be presented in Vancouver from 15 to 21 Apr 2016, determined that the majority of the 82 survivors of Ebola had brain symptoms more than 6 months after the initial infection. The investigation Prevail III, led by a team of neurologists of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and [Stroke] (NINDS), followed patients who had had Ebola virus disease and their close contacts; 82 survivors of Ebola in Liberia with an average age of 35 years have been examined.""Even though the epidemic is said to be over, these survivors are still struggling with long-term problems"", says the author of the study, Lauren Bowen, NINDS and member of the American Academy of Neurology. ""More than 28 600 people were infected by Ebola virus in West Africa during the outbreak. Of that figure, 11 300 died. In collaboration with the ongoing study on the history of survivors Prevail III, [the investigators] wanted to know more about potential long term health problems in the brain for more than 17 000 survivors of the infection"", he says. At least 6 months after the onset of his illness, the majority of the survivors had some neurologic abnormality. The most common problems were weakness, headache, memory loss, depression and muscle pain. Two were suicide bombers and one had hallucinations. Common neurologic findings were abnormal eye movements, tremor, and abnormal reflexes. The controls are in the process of being evaluated to determine which of these findings are specific to Ebola. ""It is important for us to know how this virus can continue affecting the brain in the long run,"" concludes Bowen.--Communicated by""Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[It is hard to imagine surviving such a devastating disease as Ebola only to be confronted with long-term neurologic sequelae. It is not clear whether the sequelae are due to viral persistence in a protected area of the brain leading to persistent neurologic problems, or whether the long-term problems are due to neuronal damage following virus infection. - Mod.LK]******[2] News, researchThu 10 Mar 2016: Liberia shutters Red Cross amid inquest into Ebola spending<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-liberia-idUSKCN0WC2R4>[Police closed the offices of the Liberian branch of the Red Cross on Thursday [10 Mar 2016] days after the president dismissed its board of directors amid an investigation into the use of funds targeted for dealing with the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's office gave no reason for the decision announced on Tue [8 Mar 2016] to dismiss the Red Cross's board, but the Red Cross organization has faced accusations of corruption by the local media.The Secretary General of the Liberian Red Cross and head of programs were both suspended in November [2015] after being accused of misusing USD 1.8 million in donor funds.]Sat 12 Mar 2016 Uganda: Ebola scare hits Kabale hospital<http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Ebola-scare-hits-Kabale-hospital/-/688334/3113190/-/lh57n1z/-/index.html>[Kabale [Uganda] Regional Referral Hospital admitted a patient with symptoms similar to those of Ebola virus disease (EVD) on Thu [10 Mar 2016]. According to the hospital's principal nursing officer, Sister Christine Akurut, who spoke [on 11 Mar 2016], samples of the patient were taken to the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe for examination.Sister Akurut said: ""We have isolated the patient in a separate room as we wait for the results from Entebbe. The patient, in his mid 20s, was admitted here and had almost all the symptoms of an Ebola patient. We have enough protective gear that we were left with in October 2012, when there was a Marburg fever outbreak. Most of our staff members are trained in handling Ebola and Marburg fevers, and I think there is no need for patients and other health workers to get scared.""She also said another patient with similar symptoms was briefly admitted at the hospital on Thu [10 Mar 2016] evening before he was referred to Mbarara University Teaching Hospital because he had high fevers and bleeding from different body openings, among other symptoms similar to EVD.Sistur Arkurut also said: ""Our challenge is that we do not have an isolation center as a regional referral hospital in case the patient's samples test positive to the disease. But we are on high alert to handle the patient in case he tests positive.""Research-------Fri 11 Mar 2016 Liberia: Zmapp is effective Ebola treatment<http://allafrica.com/stories/201603111180.html>[Richard T. Davey, the Deputy Clinical Director in the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, USA, has disclosed the only clinical trial evaluating whether the experimental Ebola therapy ZMapp is safe and effective for Ebola cure. Davey said that the study has revealed that ZMapp is well tolerated and suggests it may hold some promise as an Ebola treatment, but the study could not enroll enough patients to prove that ZMapp offers significantly more healing benefits than supportive care alone.][ZMapp is an experimental drug co-developed by Mapp Biophamaceutical, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) and Defyrus Inc. (Toronto, Canada). It is a combination of 3 ""humanized"" monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the EBOV GP [glycoprotein]. The uniqueness of ZMapp is that its component antibodies are produced in plants, specifically _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Mapp Biophamaceutical states that the plant is capable of expressing pharmaceutical proteins using indoor cultivation under tightly controlled conditions and that this process is rapid and scalable to mass production.ZMapp has not yet been shown to be a statistically better treatment than supportive care, but it hasn't been shown not to work either. - Mod.LK]Sat 12 Mar 2016 Liberia: PREVAIL enrolls 1034 Ebola survivors for immunity study<http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-prevail-enrolls-1034-ebola-survivors-for-immunity-study.html>[According to Dr. Masoka Fallah, approximately 1034 Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors (part of the 7500 survivors anticipated to be enrolled during the research project) have been enrolled in the Partnership for Research on the Ebola virus in Liberia (PREVAIL) study to determine whether they have developed immunity that will protect them from future infection EVD.Dr. Fallah said the study is intended to better understand the long-term health consequences of EVD, and assess whether previous EVD-infected individuals can transmit infections to close contacts and sexual partners.According to Dr. Fallah, blood samples from both groups to search for [antibodies] from past Ebola infections will be taken. In addition, they will also sample various body fluids to see whether, and how long, survivors can harbor remnants of the Ebola virus.[Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>.
