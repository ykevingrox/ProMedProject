Seven of his children tested positive for hepatitis B, and this has put a financial and emotional strain on the family.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[With a scenario of 7 children found to be HBV-infected, it is extremely likely that all of them where infected neonatally from a HBeAg positive, HBV-infected mother.  Interruption of the vertical transmission of HBV, which usually occurs from a maternal-neonatal transfusion from breakdown of the placenta, requires hyper-immune HBV globulin at birth and immediate vaccination for HBV. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>.]
