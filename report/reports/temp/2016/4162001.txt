WBAY [edited]<http://wbay.com/2016/04/13/cdc-rules-out-some-sources-of-elizabethkingia-outbreak/>The CDC tells Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) it hasn't found the source of the _Elizabethkingia_ outbreak in Wisconsin. In a letter to the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs dated last week [week of 4 Apr 2016] and obtained by Action 2 News Wed, 13 Apr 2016, the CDC says it ""ruled out high-threat sources"" including common medical products and tools and municipal water systems.The CDC says this is the 1st outbreak of _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ it has investigated. It usually only sees 5 to 10 cases a year of any type of _Elizabethkingia_ in each state, and rarely more than 2 cases at the same time. As of Wed 13 Apr 2016, the state Department of Public Health confirmed 59 cases, with 4 more suspected cases that can't be proven because of a lack of samples. Since identifying the outbreak here, the CDC put out a call for cases nationwide. So far cases related to the bacteria in Wisconsin have been confirmed in western Michigan and northern Illinois.The people affected by _Elizabethkingia_ already have serious medical problems, like chronic illnesses, that make them more vulnerable to infections. Most are elderly. The CDC says the bacteria in these infections are closely related, ""which would indicate that the infections are derived from a common source."" But the patients in this outbreak live in 13 counties in Wisconsin ""in towns with different water systems"" and some patients get their water from private wells.Also, the report says:- many patients are institution- or home-bound, limiting their geographic mobility;- there is no common exposure to a single health care or living facility;- there is no common exposure to a health care or personal care product;- there is no evidence of _Elizabethkingia_ in the home or health care environments of 11 patients for whom we conducted extensive environmental sampling;- additional studies are pending.It also hasn't confirmed person-to-person transmission. The CDC found some patients have bacteria on their skin and in their throat after they recovered, but when other people around them were tested the bacterium wasn't spreading widely.The CDC says it has had a team in Wisconsin since 14 Feb 2016, including more than 25 epidemiologists and laboratory staff, as well as members of the Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases; Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology; and Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion.Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta has the only equipment in the country capable of identifying different species of _Elizabethkingia_ within 24 hours, including _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ in the Wisconsin outbreak. The CDC says, ""In the coming weeks, all state public health laboratories will have access to CDC's specialized library"" of the microbes' chemical signatures which should make identifying cases easier.[Byline: Ted Miller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As this curious outbreak smolders along due to this relatively newly characterized species in the genus _Elizabethkingia_ (formerly _Flavobacterium_ and then _Chryseobacterium_), there remains little information reported regarding the ""spread"", that is a time line of where the cases presented over time. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/250>.]
