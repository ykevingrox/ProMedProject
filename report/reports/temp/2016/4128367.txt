Jaramillo, MD]Asia---Japan ex Cuba. 21 Mar 2016. We describe a case of a chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected patient returning from Cuba, where no autochthonous transmission case has been reported, and the number of tourists has been increasing after the normalization between Cuba and the United States.A previously healthy 27-year-old Japanese man presented to our clinic with fever and rash at the end of February 2016. He had visited Habana and Santiago de Cuba in Cuba, via Toronto in Canada, for sightseeing and stayed for 11 days starting mid-February 2016. He complained of 1-day history of high-grade fever (39.8 C [103 F]), retro-orbital pain, malaise, congested bulbar conjunctivas, and rash on his anterior chest from the return date. He had also had mild arthralgia on his knee and ankle joints for a few days at presentation.On examination, body temperature was 38.7 C [101 F], and he had congested bulbar conjunctivas, cervical lymphadenopathy, and maculopapular rash on his face, trunk, and extremities at presentation. CHIKV RNA was detected in serum samples using real-time RT-PCR performed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. He was diagnosed with CHIK fever.At the next day of the 1st visit to our clinic, rash on his extremities was getting worse and slightly itchy, and pain in the wrists and metacapophalangeal joints of hand followed by cervical pain and slight rigidity on distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of hand newly appeared, although congested bulbar conjunctivas and rash on his trunk was getting better. Shortly after that, all the symptoms were resolved.The 1st autochthonous Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Cuba was also reported in March 2016. CHIK fever, as well as dengue fever and ZIKV infection, should be considered as a differential diagnosis of febrile travellers with rash returning from Cuba.[This report was provided by Motoyuki Tsuboi, Satoshi Kutsuna , Yasuyuki Kato, Yuichi Katanami, Kei Yamamoto, Nozomi Takeshita, Kayoko Hayakaw, Shuzo Kanagawa, Norio Ohmagari, Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Japan.

Perhaps the outbreak is declining in the Americas, or the focus on Zika virus infections has overshadowed case reporting. There is the risk that febrile cases diagnosed clinically as Zika or dengue virus infections are in some cases really chikungunya virus infections, since symptoms caused by these infections are similar. Laboratory confirmation is needed to be sure of the diagnosis. - Mod.TY][See Also:Chikungunya (07): Americas 20160320.4106646Chikungunya (06): Americas 20160302.4062712Chikungunya (05): Americas 20160223.4044850Chikungunya (04): Americas 20160217.4027484Chikungunya (03) - Americas, Asia 20160206.3998786Chikungunya (02): Americas 20160126.3968082Chikungunya (01): Americas, Asia 20160108.39206972015----Chikungunya (38): Americas 20151231.3902281Chikungunya (37): Americas, Asia 20151220.3877539Chikungunya (36): Americas 20151209.3851811Chikungunya (35): Americas 20151202.3835246Chikungunya (34): Americas, Asia 20151124.3816889Chikungunya (33): Americas, Asia 20151118.3799623Chikungunya (32): Americas, Asia 20151109.3778428Chikungunya (31): Americas, Africa 20151026.3745528Chikungunya (30): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20151012.3710882Chikungunya (29): Americas, Asia 20151005.3693195Chikungunya (28): Americas, Asia, Africa 20150926.3671932].................................................sb/sh/ty/msp/jw"
