Dakar Actu [in French, trans. Mod.LK, edited]<http://www.dakaractu.com/Des-cas-d-Ebola-lies-en-Guinee-et-au-Liberia_a109158.html>Ebola virus Disease, Guinea and Liberia cases related - West Africa-------------------------------------------------------------------After the death in Monrovia of a woman infected with the Ebola virus, it was established that new cases in Guinea and neighboring Liberia are directly related. Only vigilance, and not the closing of borders, will help prevent the spread of Ebola, Sierra Leone Minister of Health said on [Sun 10 Apr 2016].The woman died of Ebola 31 Mar [2016] in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, after crossing the border with Guinea with her children for a few days where it was closed after the announcement on 17 Mar of the reappearance of the virus in Guinea, where the epidemic was declared finished on 29 Dec [2015].This woman and her 3 children, including 2 aged 5 and 2, have since tested positive for the virus. They were the family of a man who died of Ebola 21 Mar in the Macenta prefecture in the South of Guinea, revealed this weekend the World Health Organization (WHO).""The closure of the borders between the 3 countries is not the right response to the threat of Ebola"", said the Sierra Leonean Minister of Health Abubakarr Fofanah on Sunday to AFP [Agence France-Presse], returning from an inspection tour with health officials on the border with Guinea. ""We found that everything was in place and we maintain a constant health monitoring on the entry and exit of vehicles and pedestrians on our territory,"" assured the Minister, calling the border populations to be vigilant.New related cases in Liberia and Guinea--------------------------------According to a WHO release dated [Thu 17 Apr 2016], teams of the WHO and departments of the Guinean and Liberian health ""have established epidemiological links between new cases of Ebola in Liberia and a current episode in Guinea."" And after the 1st results of the investigation into the source of these cases and their ""contacts"", including those of the man who died in Macenta, ""the woman departed for Liberia with her 3 children after the death of her husband to join relatives living in Monrovia, the capital. This is where she is assumed to have developed the symptoms.""""A hundred people identified as exposed to contamination during contacts with cases registered in Liberia, have been placed under medical supervision and must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus, as has already been the case in Guinea for some 1400 others,'' said WHO. Among the contained personal are ""15 healthcare workers, who have been in contact with the 1st victim, the woman who died,"" said to the AFP, George Sorbor, a spokesman of the Liberian Ministry of Health.New cases in Guinea -- 9, including 8 deaths, according to the last balance sheet -- were discovered in Koropara (South), near the border with Liberia, after the death on 27 Feb [2016] of a woman who began to exhibit symptoms on 15 Feb 2016, according to the WHO.--Communicated by:ProMED-FRA<ProMED-FRA@promedmail.org>[The new outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea and Liberia would be linked. Cases occurring in Guinea would traverse the border to neighboring Liberia. This poses the problem of the porosity of our borders and the relaxation of the cross-border supervision. The requiem for the death of Ebola was celebrated too soon and the virus had not said its last word. Efforts must be provided for a broad awareness in order to stem this new epidemic. The closing of the borders is not a suitable solution.The epidemic of Ebola in West Africa, the most serious since the identification of the virus 40 years ago in Central Africa, has caused more than 11 300 dead out of some 28 000 cases, a undervalued number by the admission of WHO.The victims are concentrated in more than 99 per cent in 3 neighboring countries: Guinea, where the epidemic was declared in December 2013, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The vaccine, which has shown high efficiency and good tolerance, could be the lethal weapon against the Ebola virus.A topographic map of Africa is available at: <http://www.e-voyageur.com/atlas/afrique.htm>A clickable map of Africa is available at: <http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/afrique/AFRIQUE-MAP-clic.htm>Maps of Liberia can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/liberia_pol_2004.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>. - Mod.BM]******[2] Ebola virus-maximum alert - Mali (West) commentDate: Wed 13 April 2016Source: Journal Metro, The Associated Press report [in French, trans.

How can they find these 2 women, when we know that people do not cooperate with the public authorities? It should be noted that, until now, many people do not believe in the Ebola Virus. Some people think that this is a pure invention in order to earn money. Communication is and will continue to occupy a prominent place in the fight against epidemics, against Ebola in particular. All means of communications should be used; people resources, as the opinion leaders, religious leaders and traditional healers, women's associations, youth, everyone must be involved in the fight against the spread of the epidemic. Borders, instead of being closed, should be better monitored.--Communicated by:ProMED-FRA<ProMED-FRA@promedmail.org>An interactive map from HealthMap/ProMED-mail of Mali is available at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/50>. - Mod.BM]******[3] Guinea, vaccine funding14 Apr 2016. One known Ebola case left in Guinea after girl's discharge <http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-ebola-case-left-guinea-girl.html>According to the Alliance For International Medical Action (ALIMA), which runs Guinea's only treatment center in the southern city of Nzerekore, a dedicated [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] clinic was treating Guinea's only known case of EVD on [Thu 14 Apr 2016] after the recovery of a girl diagnosed with EVD. ALIMA emergency coordinator, Solenne Barbe, said ""[of] 6 confirmed cases, 4 have died, 1 was discharged after recovery, and the 6th is still here."" Barbe attributed the high mortality rate to the fact that the recent patients arrived too late to be treated with a good chance of survival. She also said the newest confirmed case is an elderly man from Macenta prefecture (north of Nzerekore), thought to be a healer visited by one of the dead while still alive and infected with EVD.Funding for vaccines-----------15 Apr 2016: NewLink Genetics (NLNK) Unit receives USD 2.8 million Base Contract from DTRA<http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/NewLink+Genetics+%28NLNK%29+Unit+Receives+$2.8M+Base+Contract+from+DTRA/11507416.html>NewLink Genetics Corporation announced that the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) of the United States Department of Defense has awarded a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics, a USD 2.8 million base contract with potential future options totaling USD 6.3 million to support the development of vaccines against filovirus species, including Marburg [MARV] and Ebola Sudan viruses [SUDV), which could be combined with Ebola Zaire [EBOV] virus in a multivalent vaccine formulation or vaccination schedule.The majority of the work in this contract will take place under an agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. NewLink Genetics has licensed research, development and manufacturing of its Ebola vaccine program, including these filovirus vaccine candidates, to Merck.NewLink Genetics and Merck are continuing efforts for development of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Ebola Zaire (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine (V920). The rVSV-filovirus vaccine platform was originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and was subsequently licensed to a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics.According to Dr Charles Link, CEO and Chief Scientific Officer of NewLink Genetics ""Preclinical and clinical studies with the rVSV-ZEBOV candidate suggest that the inclusion of other filoviruses in this vaccine platform can be used to develop multiple vaccines or a single multivalent formula which is our ultimate goal. These funds will support studies to further advance these candidates.""[Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.
