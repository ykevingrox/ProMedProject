Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Saudi Arabia's notification of MERS-CoV to the OIE has been long due. Other countries in the Arab peninsula, where the disease was discovered later and the number of human cases significantly lower, have submitted their notification earlier (in parentheses, date of initial notification): Qatar (28 Nov 2013), Oman (23 May 2014) and Kuwait (11 Jun 2014). Iran joined them on 29 Oct 2014, notifying cases in camels allegedly imported from Pakistan.Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a disease 1st identified in humans in April 2012. It is caused by infection with a coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since 2012 over 1600 human cases of MERS, including more than 600 deaths, have been reported by local health authorities predominantly in the Middle East, most of them from Saudi Arabia.The source of the virus remains unknown, but the pattern of transmission and virological studies point towards dromedary camels in the Middle East being a reservoir from which humans sporadically become infected through zoonotic transmission. Infections in dromedary camels have been detected across the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. Antibodies against MERS-CoV (or another very similar virus) have also been detected in samples taken from camels in a number of countries in the Middle East, North Africa, East and West Africa and the Canary Islands; some of these seropositive samples date back to 1992. Positive PCR results for MERS-CoV or isolation of the virus from animals is notifiable to the OIE because MERS-CoV is an emerging disease with a significant public health impact. In late October 2015, The Saudi Ministry of Health Command Control Center (CCC) began publishing a weekly monitor report on MERS-CoV which is available via <http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/Pages/Weekly-Monitor.aspx>. The most recent issue (Vol. 2, Issue 4, 26 Jan 2016) mentions the risk associated with contact with camels, especially juvenile camels less than 2 years of age. This may have been eventually the background to the decision to report the disease in camels to the OIE -- similarly to the other reports -- as an ""emerging disease"".It would be helpful to obtain clarification (or an update) of the reporting agency for considering the event as having ""no zoonotic impact"". The date of start of the event in camels, given as 29 Dec 2015, deserves also some clarification. - Mods.AS/CRDA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2696>.]
