The 3 men, 2 women and 2 children, from 3 different families, complained of severe stomach aches, headaches and diarrhoea.Victim IL said: ""We decided to slaughter the sheep since it was dying of an unknown disease. We have been eating dead sheep, goats and cows but have never fallen sick."" IL was 1 of the 7 people who ate meat from a sheep's carcass, at Samburu County Referral Hospital, 4 Dec 2016.Duke Mogaka, a medical officer at the facility, said the patients were from Sagumai area. ""We are trying to stabilise 2 patients who are in severe condition,"" he said, adding the others were stable.Mogaka urged residents to avoid eating meat from dead animals and eating contaminated food. He asked area public health officers to sensitise them.[Byline: Martin Fundi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Samburu County is in north central Kenya in the former Rift Valley Province; see Wikipedia for a description and map <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samburu_County>.This is a classic scenario for a human anthrax outbreak in Africa, and in many other parts of the world too, I fear. Whether it is in fact ""anthrax"" must await further clarification. Anthrax is common in the Rift Valley, with outbreaks in 2005 (bovine 1 outbreaks), 2006 (bovine 6), 2007 (bovine 5), 2008 (bovine 1, sheep & goats 1), 2009 (bovine 4), 2010 (bovine 1, pigs 2), 2011 (bovine 1, sheep & goats 1), 2013 (bovine 1), 2014 (bovine, 9), 2015 (bovine 20, sheep & goats 1). Seemingly random sheep deaths are frequently ignored until the number becomes significant. Thus a single sick sheep is likely in rural Africa to be eaten. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45169>.]
