Virology Down Under Blogspot [edited]<http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/zika-virus-in-amniotic-fluidbut-is-that.html>Zika virus in amniotic fluid...but is that enough?----------A report published this month provides background of an investigation of 2 women described as being part of the 'microcephaly cluster' in Brazil.The study describes ZIKV detection in the amniotic fluids of the 2 women; the 1st laboratory-confirmed detections of vertical transmission (from mother to embryo/foetus/baby) of Zika virus (ZIKV; genotyped as ""Asian"" strains).[1] Transmission around the time of birth (perinatal transmission) has been reported before.[2]Interestingly, neither mother had ZIKV RNA detected by RT-PCR, suggesting they were not acutely infected at the time of the investigations. The authors were not clear on whether viral culture was attempted or whether antibody studies were conducted on the mothers. There is no real time frame for when the mothers were infected beyond a comment that they had relevant symptoms. The authors also do not describe investigations for any other infectious agents or environmental factors nor anything about the deliveries.Investigation #1...Foetal ultrasound was conducted at 30.1 weeks' gestation and revealed anomalies including:- unusually small head circumference- low weight- brain atrophy- coarse calcifications of the frontal lobeInvestigation #2...Foetal ultrasound 29.2 weeks' gestation and revealed anomalies including:- unusually small head circumference- low weight- a range of brain anomalies- some calcifications- cataracts in both eyes and 1 eye was smaller than the otherAround the same time in the same State (Paraiba)....- 6 children borne with small head circumference were diagnosed with ZIKV (lab confirmed?) and born (without complication?) to mothers reporting symptoms during pregnancyThe authors noted that the lack of cases of vertical ZIKV transmission found in over 65 preceding years may be because cases have not been sought, not been reported or were just rare until now. This lack of data may also relate to levels of local immunity which may act to moderate ZIKV infection among people in areas of endemic transmission, or perhaps because the virus has changed and this is a new trick it has acquired because of mutation. In short, we don't know if microcephaly and central nervous system developmental interference is a new or an old-but-unknown feature of Zika virus disease (ZVD). Or if it is even related to ZIKV at all.The authors conclude by warning that if investigations in other states of Brazil find people with ZIKV antibodies, that this is a severe health threat. However they make no mention of the importance of seeking other culprits -- likely or not -- in the search for understanding of why cases of microcephaly in Brazil have risen so rapidly. Differential diagnosis can be a complex beast in the mosquito-borne virus world.In a 1 Dec [2015] Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological alert,[3] data up to 30 Nov 2015 listed 1248 cases of microcephaly (99.7 / 100 000 live births), including 7 deaths, in 14 states of Brazil. By comparison, in 2000, the prevalence was 5.5 cases / 100 000 live births and 5.7 cases / 100 000 live births in 2010.[3] More recently the Brazil Ministry of Health tabulated all microcephaly cases. From an average of 156 cases in each of the preceding 5 years, the number has jumped to 3174 cases in 2015. Both data sets describe a 20-fold increase in cases in just a year.[4]Whether ZIKV is to blame, or something else, the urgency with which this outbreak of microcephaly is now being investigated in Brazil is clearly warranted.

These infants had cerebral calcifications detected by CT scans and presumable intrauterus ZIKV infection. 1 of the mothers reported rash and arthralgia in the 1st trimester. Toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, syphillis, and HIV were ruled out in all cases (mothers and infants), fulfilling the Ministry of Health's criteria for ZIKV vertical infection.Mothers and infants underwent ocular examination that included biomicroscopy and fundus examination. The mothers had no ocular lesions. The 3 infants had unilateral ocular findings involving solely the macular region. All 3 infants presented with gross macular pigment mottling and foveal reflex loss. A well-defined macular neuroretinal atrophy was detected in one child. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of ocular findings in infants with microcephaly born after the ZIKV outbreak. All 3 children had fundoscopic alterations in the macular region. Although ZIKV infection was not tested by real-time PCR, cases fulfill criteria for ZIKV vertical infection. Further studies are being conducted in a larger group of infants to assess the ocular manifestations of ZIKV vertical infection.--Communicated byDavid M.

Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/160109/alertan-brote-de-virus-similar-al-zika-en-maracaibo>An alert has been issued for an outbreak of a virus similar to Zika in Maracaibo--------The Director of the Maracaibo University Hospital [SAHUM], Samuel Viloria, announced that a safety protocol due to an outbreak of a virus similar to Zika. [He said] ""we are dealing with Guillain-Barre disease [GBS], an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy of unknown origin.""He said that the pathophysiology is not completely clear, and stated that an infectious agent induces an immunological response that is both humoral and cellular, that produces a cross reaction against the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves that causes their destruction.The virus [GBS?] is presenting with much frequency and is preceded by a virus infection followed by a clinical picture with neurological sequellae that includes muscular paralysis that can affect respiratory muscles. ""There have been 7 patients admitted in critical condition by the Adult Emergency Services of SAHUM, but we now, have an additional 4 people registered in recuperation wards who have downgraded from the critical phase,"" the Director of the Maracaibo Hospital stated. It is recommended that homes be fumigated to eliminate mosquito breeding sites now that GBS initially presents with symptoms of Zika virus [infection]. [Byline: Teresa Luengo] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report does not provide information linking the GBS cases to Zika virus infections. There is no indication that the GBS patients have been shown to have been infected by the virus. Because GBS has been reported to occur in a small proportion of individuals who have been infected with the virus, if there really are 7 post-Zika GBS cases, that implies that there must be hundreds of individuals in Maracaibo who have had Zika virus infections. To date, no such reports of large numbers of cases have come to ProMED, and ProMED would be very interested in receiving them.
