Checking records there was one prior case reported from Huraymla back in May 2015.During the month of July 2016 there were 12 newly confirmed cases reported from Saudi Arabia; all but one were classified as primary cases. Of the 11 primary cases, 2 had a history of direct contact with camels, 4 had a history of indirect contact with camels, 3 had no history of camel contact, and 2 were still under investigation for camel exposure.To date in August 2016 there have been 4 newly confirmed cases; 3 classified as primary cases (1 indirect contact with camels, 1 no known contact with camels and 1 still under investigation).So the question remains, in the absence of documented contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, what high risk exposures are these sporadic cases having?A map showing the location of this newly confirmed case and recovery can be found at the source URL.

The authority tested livestock at 3 farms where owners had tested positive for MERS-CoV in 2014, as well as 37 others within a 3 km [about 2 mi] radius. Thirty-nine were camel farms and one was a sheep farm.The authority conducted ""a systematic surveillance"" of the disease in camel farms, it said. ""We also added to the growing knowledge on the disease a solid proof that camels are major source of the virus that infect humans,"" the authority said.As many as 42 out of 1113 camels that were swabbed tested positive for MERS-CoV, while the sheep were virus-free. Infected camels were isolated and tested until they were found to be free of the virus, and the farms where they were found were disinfected. ""We found that the prevalence of MERS-CoV in camel farms varied from 1.8 per cent in one farm and 76.7 per cent in another farm,"" the authority said.When the authority tested 7803 camels in slaughterhouses last year [2015] and at the Saudi and Omani borders in 2014, it found that 1.6 per cent of the animals had been infected. But researchers said that the prevalence could be higher in the most recent study because the sample came from farms that had or were near confirmed human cases of MERS-CoV. ""We must take into consideration that we concentrated on camel farms linked to human infections and also camels at the borders with [Saudi Arabia],"" the authority said.The authority previously found that camels at the borders and in slaughterhouse are more likely to be hot spots for potential animal infections. ""Therefore, our current procedure is to test camels, and positive camels are quarantined until they are free from the virus,"" he said.However, the latest findings among camels in local farms indicate that such farms could be ""actively participating in the spread of the virus among animals or humans"", the researchers said. Two of the infected owners ""had repeated visits to these farms"" and ""were drinking raw camel milk"". The 3rd infected farmer owned the sheep farm, but had recently visited Saudi Arabia, where he was exposed to camels. All 3 owners were men in their 60s. Workers at the 3 farms tested negative for the virus, and milk and drinking water samples taken there also came back negative.A total of 4 camel farms near 1 of the farms linked to human infection had livestock testing positive for MERS-CoV, suggesting that direct, airborne or surface transmission could be the route of virus spread among camel farms, according to the study. ""However, further investigation is needed to exclude the possibility that these farms became infected independently"", the researchers said.The UAE ranks 3rd, after Saudi Arabia and South Korea, for the number of Middle East respiratory syndrome infections among humans. Since the virus was 1st detected in 2012, there have been 1791 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infections and 640 MERS-CoV-related deaths, according to the World Health Organization.[byline: Roberta Pennington]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The article cited in the above media report is: Muhairi SA, Hosani FA, Eltahir YM, Mulla MA, Yusof MF, Serhan WS, et al.

Nasal swabs from 1113 dromedary camels (39 farms) and 34 sheep (1 farm) and sputum samples from 2 MERS-CoV-infected camel farm owners and 1 MERS-CoV-infected sheep farm owner were collected. Samples from camels and humans underwent real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR screening to detect MERS-CoV. In addition, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partially characterized MERS-CoV genome fragments obtained from camels were performed. Among the 40 farms, 6 camel farms were positive for MERS-CoV; the virus was not detected in the single sheep farm. The maximum duration of viral shedding from infected camels was 2 weeks after the 1st positive test result as detected in nasal swabs and in rectal swabs obtained from infected calves. 3 partial camel sequences characterized in this study (open reading frames 1a and 1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and ORF4b) together with the corresponding regions of previously reported MERS-CoV sequence obtained from 1 farm owner were clustering together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster containing human and camel isolates reported for the Arabian Peninsula. Data provided further evidence of the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV infection and strongly suggested that camels may have a role in the transmission of the virus to humans.""If an individual camel sheds the virus for approximately 6 weeks and is therefore presumably capable of transmitting the virus to other camels as well as humans in proximity, a question that comes to mind is whether this leads to sustained transmission among the camels in any given farm, especially if there is breeding or purchasing of new camels during the course of the year. Another curiosity here is the age of the owners -- all 3 in their 60s when having their acute infection. Small sample size but somewhat suggestive of either recent introduction of the virus into their farms, or perhaps a recent change in immune status of the owners. More food for thought and need for further studies on animal husbandry practices and virus transmission.The HealthMap/ProMED map of United Arab Emirates can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/132>. - Mod.MPP]
