This brief report of 4 cases of conjunctivitis caused by _Raoultella planticola_ provides a description of possibly the first documented cases of this eye infection.Methods. The laboratory database and medical records were used to trace all the _R. planticola_-positive conjunctival swabs obtained in our institution. Four cases were identified and available relevant information was obtained.Results. This organism causes a non-specific purulent conjunctivitis that seems to have a benign course and tends to be responsive to a topical fluoroquinolone.Conclusions. The possibility of atypical organisms must be considered when managing infective conjunctivitis. Conjunctival swabs should be obtained and topical treatment switched when initial empirical therapy fails.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Raoultella planticola_ is an encapsulated Gram-negative bacterium in the Enterobacteriaceae family that is primarily associated with plant and aquatic environments. It was initially designated _Klebsiella planticola_ in 1981 and distinguished from _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ on the basis of phenotypic characteristics that include growth at 10 C [50 F] and utilization of L-sorbose as carbon source (1). Its genus was renamed _Raoultella_ in 2001(2), and studies have shown that 0.2 to 19.0 percent of isolates initially identified as _Klebsiella_ spp. were _Raoultella_ spp. by 16S rRNA analysis (3). _Raoultella planticola_ has been reported to be uncommonly isolated from patients. Diseases have included sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, cholangitis, lower urinary tract infection, nosocomial pneumonia, and pancreatitis (4,5). Some isolates have been shown to produce _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC) and extended-spectrum B-lactamase (ESBL) (3,6)._R. planticola_ (along with _Raoultella ornithinolytica_) possess the ability to convert histidine to histamine via decarboxylation, which can lead to scombroid poisoning when there is consumption of poorly refrigerated histidine-containing seafood (4).1.
