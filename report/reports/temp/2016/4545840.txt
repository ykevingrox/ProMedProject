Micro Services [in Spanish, trans. Mod.JG, edited]<http://www.microservices.es/brote-de-legionella-asociado-un-hotel-de-salou>The Public Health Agency of Catalonia is currently investigating the origin of a legionellosis outbreak in Salou [a coastal town in the province of Tarragona, in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain].There are 7 affected patients, 5 male and 2 female, and their ages range from 50 to 82 years. They all stayed at a Salou hotel in September [2016], and they come from different Spanish regions or from different countries of the European Union.Four patients are still hospitalized; one was discharged, one died, and there is no data about the outcome of another patient.Amongst the affected persons, one is a French tourist; another is an Irish tourist; 2 are Catalonian citizens; one person is from La Rioja [an autonomous community and a province in northern Spain], and the last one is from Aragon [an autonomous community in northern Spain].The deceased person is a 50-year-old male who lived in Madrid. The cases occurred between 28 Sep and 6 Oct 2016, and they were reported though the Epidemiological Surveillance Network from Spain (RENAVE, according to its Spanish initials), and the European Network for Legionellosis Surveillance (ELDSNET). The epidemiological alert was set last 28 Sep 2016 after 2 clients from the same hotel presented with a _Legionella_ infection.The hotel, which has a great number of rooms available, has been closed since 2 Oct 2016 because of the end of the season.Legionnaire's disease associated with travel is an important issue for the prevention of _Legionella_ infections in Europe. In the absence of other risky sources, such as jacuzzi baths or cooling towers, the usual source for cases associated with hotels is the warm water in guest rooms. The showers emit aerosolized particles, which, if the water is contaminated, may affect clients with some kind of personal susceptibility.--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion1@q-net.net.au>[Salou, with a population of 26 558 residents, is a town on the Mediterranean coast of northeastern Spain in the province of Tarragona, in the autonomous community of Catalonia, 110 km (68 miles) south of Barcelona (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salou#Climate>).The following has been extracted from the U.S. CDC document Travel-Associated Legionnaires' Disease (<http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/faq.htm>):""About 20-25 percent of all Legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and to report because its identification implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to be exposed. Clusters of Legionnaires' disease associated with travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms. Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. ...""Potential environmental sampling sites for _Legionella_ spp that the CDC document suggests include: internal surfaces of faucets, aerators, and shower heads; and water from incoming water mains, holding tanks and cisterns, water heater tanks, decorative fountains, irrigation equipment, fire sprinkler systems (if recently used), whirlpools, and spas. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of any clinical isolates, if the species of _Legionella_ are the same, to assure frequently costly corrective measures are carried out on the actual source (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/>; and<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1341>.]
