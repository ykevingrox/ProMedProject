Detroit Free Press [edited]<http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/01/13/snyder-flint-area-has-seen-spike-legionnaires/78750610/>Since Flint [Michigan] switched its water source to the Flint River, officials have seen a spike in the number of cases of a severe form of pneumonia, called legionnaires' disease -- but officials say they're still looking for the cause.There have been 87 cases in Genesee County from June 2014 to November 2015 -- and 10 of those cases resulted in death, said Dr Eden Wells, chief medical executive with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or MDHHS.That number is a jump from previous few years, when the county saw between 6 and 13 cases. It's not clear how many were fatal.While state officials said they couldn't make a connection between the water and the spike in disease, a drinking water expert who studied Flint said the rise in cases was ""dramatic,"" and added there's a ""very strong likelihood"" the river's water played a role.""I applaud the state for releasing this (report),"" said Marc Edwards, who heads the Virginia Tech Research Team, which was a key player in exposing lead contamination in the city's water.Officials with the MDHHS say they noticed the spike in the fall of 2014. Months later, in April [2015], MDHHS said they began interviewing residents who were affected. That summer, Edwards and his team noticed that in some large buildings, which can have older plumbing systems, there were high levels of the bacteria that can cause the illness. ""Our hypothesis is that something about the Flint River and lack of corrosion control, plus big buildings, is creating these problems,"" Edwards said Wednesday.Though officials held a news conference [Wed 13 Jan 2016] to alert the public about the spike, they made clear that there were no changes in recommendations for bathing or showering. Edwards also noted that the water is safe for residents to shower in. ""There's every reason to believe (the spike) is something in the past,"" he added.Legionnaires' disease is a lung infection caused by _Legionella_, a type of bacteria that grows best in warm water. The bacterium usually enters the body from a person breathing it in, but it can't spread between people. The most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems.Gov. Rick Snyder said he learned of the disease cases only ""a few days ago,"" and acknowledged during questioning that the increase in legionnaires' disease ""just adds to the disaster we are already facing."" Flint's water became contaminated with lead in 2014, once its supply source was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint River water, which was treated at the city water treatment plant. The state downplayed and largely ignored the immediate complaints about the smell, color, and taste. In October [2015?], the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality acknowledged it had failed to ensure the necessary safeguards for corrosion. That failure resulted in lead leaching into the water. Lead causes permanent brain damage in children and is linked to other health and behavior problems. The crisis became even more apparent this month [January 2016], when Snyder declared a state of emergency, and Michigan State Police joined others in distributing bottled water and water filters. The state has also urged all Flint parents with children younger than 6 to have their children's blood tested for exposure to lead.In response to Snyder's announcement [Wed 13 Jan 2016], Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint, demanded that national infectious disease specialists arrive in Flint ""tomorrow"" and added, ""We need an investigation into the past outbreak so we know what happened, whether there is any ongoing threat, and how to make sure it doesn't happen again.""Flint's water is still unsafe to drink. Officials on [Wed 13 Jan 2016] did not give a firm time estimate as to when the water might be drinkable once again, though Edwards noted that lead levels in a few homes have already gone down dramatically.At the news conference on [Wed 13 Jan 2016], Snyder fielded questions about his administration's handling of the crisis. He said that a good portion of the fault ""could lie"" with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and welcomed the federal investigation already under way.""We're taking every action within reason, and going beyond reason to address this,"" he said. He also said, ""This is something you wish that never happened, and let's see that it never happens again in the state of Michigan.""Fund established for Flint children-----------------------------------A fund has been established to address the short- and long-term needs of Flint children exposed to lead through contaminated drinking water, the Community Foundation of Greater Flint announced [Mon 11 Jan 2016].""Our Flint children deserve every opportunity to be healthy and successful,"" said Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Hurley Medical Center pediatrician who helped expose the tragedy. ""The creation of this Fund will further ensure that our children are afforded the resources and interventions to overcome this population-wide exposure to lead.""[Byline: Daniel Bethencourt]--Communicated by:Jason Barker<jhbarker@mac.com>******[2]Date: Wed 13 Jan 2016Source: Flint Water Study/Updates [edited}<http://flintwaterstudy.org>Initial Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) regarding _Legionella_ bacteria in present-day Flint (<http://flintwaterstudy.org/2016/01/initial-frequently-asked-questions-faq-regarding-legionella-bacteria-in-present-day-flint/>):We agree with DHHS [Department of Health and Human Services ] that this problem, is probably behind us all, even it if was caused by the Flint River water. It is safe to shower now whether you are an adult or a child. When we say ""safe,"" we mean it is no riskier to shower in Flint now than in any other US city.During August of 2015 we focused our _Legionella_ testing on residences and smaller buildings like McDonald's throughout the city. Despite looking as hard as we could, we could find no trace of the _Legionella_ bacterial strain that causes disease. So in homes and small buildings at least, based on our data, the risk of exposure was relatively low. We published those data on our website (<http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/results-from-field-sampling-in-flint-aug-17-19-2015-opportunistic-pathogens-2/>) earlier in the year, and frankly, we were a little surprised there was not more _Legionella_.However, just before the switch back to Detroit [in October 2015], we sampled larger buildings, and we found very high levels of the types of _Legionella_ that cause disease. So we tend to feel, that the risk of exposure, was much higher in the bigger buildings.A key hypothesis of our National Science Foundation RAPID [Rapid Response Research] grant is that the rapid corrosion of iron water mains in Flint would dramatically increase growth of _Legionella_ in buildings. Mechanistically, higher rates of iron corrosion will produce: 1) higher iron in water, and 2) lower levels of free chlorine. Both of these factors were confirmed to be present in Flint during our field sampling, and have been shown to dramatically increase _Legionella_ regrowth in our recently published laboratory research utilizing simulated distribution systems [1-5].Additional research is needed to examine the basis of this relationship.References----------1.

Genesee County can be seen on the map at <http://geology.com/county-map/michigan-county-map.gif>.The city of Flint, Michigan, located along the Flint River, 66 miles (106 km) northwest of Detroit, with a population of 102 434 in 2010, is the largest city and county seat of Genesee County (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint,_Michigan>).The increase in cases of legionnaires' disease in Flint happened after Flint switched its water source in April 2014 from the Great Lakes (for which they were paying the city of Detroit) to the Flint River, which runs through the city of Flint. Flint switched back to Detroit water in October 2015.The Flint River water is said to be highly corrosive: 19 times more so than the supply from the Great Lakes, according to researchers from Virginia Tech, which led to higher iron levels and lower chlorine levels (<http://flintwaterstudy.org/about-page/about-us/>). Failure to use anti-corrosive treatment on the Flint River water is believed to have led to higher iron levels. The lack of treatment of Flint River water to make it less corrosive is believed to have also contributed to increasing amounts of lead leaching into the city's water supply since April 2014, when the city changed its water source to the river, according to researchers from Virginia Tech (<http://flintwaterstudy.org/about-page/about-us/>).However, several questions remain. The report in item 2 above says that ""we sampled larger buildings, and we found very high levels of the types of _Legionella_ that cause disease."" (_Legionella_ were said not to be isolated in smaller commercial buildings or homes.) But were there any home residences in the large buildings that had positive cultures for _Legionella_? Also, the report fails to say where in the large buildings the samples were obtained. Were the positive water samples in these large buildings from tap water or from the air conditioning system's cooling towers, or perhaps elsewhere in the large building? Are suspected water sources in the large buildings still positive for _Legionella_ bacteria after the switch from Flint River water back to the Great Lakes in October 2015, and are cases of legonnaires' disease still occurring? Were the water sources in the large buildings remediated after the switch from Flint River water back to the Great Lakes?Also, to make a definitive link between a water source and legionnaires' disease requires matching the genotype of the strain of the _Legionella_ bacillus isolated from a Flint patient with the strain isolated from the suspected water source. Were genotypes obtained from clinical and environmental isolates and did the genotypes match? Further information in this regard concerning the Flint outbreak would be welcomed from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
