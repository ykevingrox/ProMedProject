Stat News [edited]<https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/09/superbugs-antibiotic-resistance-mcr1/>There is some moderately good news and bad news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the new superbug that has been generating concern in the United States and elsewhere.1st the bad: Another human case of the bug, known as _mcr-1_, has been found in the United States, bringing the total domestic cases so far to 4. The moderately good news: Investigations into 2 of those cases failed to turn up any evidence the bug spread to contacts of the people who were carrying it. The reports of those investigations were published Friday [9 Sep 2016] in the CDC's online journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [1,2]. ""These findings suggest that the risk for transmission from a colonized patient to otherwise healthy persons, including persons with substantial exposure to the patient, might be relatively low,"" the authors of the investigation into the 1st detected US case wrote. The case was a woman in Pennsylvania who was found to have the _E. coli_ carrying the _mcr-1_ gene in her system in May [2016]. The woman, who had been hospitalized multiple times in the time leading up to the discovery, was being evaluated for a possible urinary tract infection. The _mcr-1_ gene -- which is able to jump from bacterium to bacterium -- makes bugs carrying it capable of resisting the antibiotic colistin, which is considered a drug of last resort. It is used when bacteria are resistant to other, more commonly used antibiotics.The fear is that _mcr-1_, combined with other forms of antibiotic resistance, will give rise to bacteria that cannot be successfully treated with antibiotics. Disease detectives studying the case of this woman and another, a baby in Connecticut who was found in June [2016] to be infected with _E. coli_ carrying the _mcr-1_ gene, identified and tested family members and close contacts who had the type of contact with these 2 patients that might have led to spread of the bacteria.In the case of the woman from Pennsylvania, 98 people agreed to be tested. The baby had fewer close contacts; 6 were tested, and none was found to be carrying the gene. The lack of evident spread doesn't mean, though, that health care providers can let down their guards. ""Health care personnel should immediately report colistin-resistant bacteria to their local health department,"" the authors of the Pennsylvania report wrote. They are from the state's health department and the CDC. ""Health departments are encouraged to rapidly investigate reports of colistin-resistant bacteria to prevent transmission to other patients and thereby decrease the risk for transmitting plasmid-encoded genes to bacteria that might already contain other resistance genes.""References:1.

The 3rd was detected in samples from a 74-year-old New Jersey man dating to August 2014.CDC researchers said the case in Connecticut ""points to a food-borne acquisition as the most probable cause"" for the 2-year-old acquiring the bug, reporting that she was in the Caribbean for 2-3 weeks and consumed chicken and goat meat from a live animal market there. The girl developed fever and bloody diarrhea 2 days before returning to the United States. ""We know this is food-borne, and we know from outbreaks in other countries that's how most people get it,"" Alexander Kallen, an antibiotic resistance researcher at the CDC, told The Washington Post.There is no evidence that the 4 human cases of _mcr-1_ detected in the United States are related, but researchers say they expect to see more cases of the bug.[Byline: Stephen Feller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There are now apparently 4 cases with _mcr-1_-positive isolates reported in the U.S.: One case each in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and now Connecticut. The latest case is the 2-year-old Connecticut child with a food-borne infection due to _mcr-1_- _E. coli_ 0157.With regard to the Pennsylvania patient, the following is extracted from reference 1 in the 1st news report above:""In 2015, scientists reported the emergence of the plasmid-encoded _mcr-1_ gene conferring bacterial resistance to the antibiotic colistin (1), signaling potential emergence of a pandrug-resistant bacterium. In May 2016, _mcr-1_-positive _Escherichia coli_ was 1st isolated from a specimen from a U.S. patient (2) when a Pennsylvania woman was evaluated for a urinary tract infection. The urine culture and subsequent testing identified the gene in an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _E. coli_ with reduced susceptibility to colistin. The patient had no international travel for approximately 1 year, no livestock exposure, and a limited role in meal preparation with store-bought groceries; however, she had multiple and repeated admissions to four medical facilities during 2016.""In collaboration with CDC, the Pennsylvania Department of Health conducted an investigation to guide contact tracing and perirectal swab screening for bacteria with the _mcr-1_ gene in the patient's household and in 2 facilities where she had frequent, extensive, and prolonged (7 days or longer) interactions with health care personnel. Within these 3 high-risk locations, transmission risk was stratified into higher-risk and lower-risk categories based on the nature and duration of contact. 20 persons at higher risk included the patient's medical facility roommate, household contacts, home health personnel, friends who assisted with activities of daily living such as cleaning, bathing, rotating, ambulating and toileting, and a patient who developed an _E. coli_ infection after receiving direct care from a caregiver who also assisted the index patient. Persons at lower risk included 98 health care personnel from the 2 high-risk facilities who directly assisted with activities of daily living while generally adhering to contact precautions. All 20 higher-risk contacts completed screening; among the 98 lower-risk contacts, 78 agreed to testing.""To determine whether transmission was occurring between patients, the state health department offered to conduct point prevalence studies at the 2 high-risk facilities. One facility declined; the other offered testing to 18 patients residing in the same unit where the index patient had received care. Seven patients completed screening.""No bacteria with the _mcr-1_ gene were detected among the 105 persons screened. In addition, no colistin-resistant organisms were detected among 51 ESBL-producing isolates prospectively collected over a 30-day period from the four facilities to which the index patient was admitted in 2016. These findings suggest that the risk for transmission from a colonized patient to otherwise healthy persons, including persons with substantial exposure to the patient, might be relatively low.""The index patient was screened monthly to monitor colonization status. Perirectal swabs collected on 31 May [2016] and 26 June [2016] were positive for bacteria with the _mcr-1_ gene, but a swab collected on 1 Aug 2016 was negative. The patient received no antibiotics during this period, and there are no current recommendations to decolonize patients with Gram-negative bacteria in their gastrointestinal tracts.""It is not known how the patient became colonized, especially in the absence of an epidemiologic link to known persons or places with identified _mcr-1_. Nonetheless, as more surveillance systems with broader testing are established, it is anticipated that mcr-1 will be identified with increasing frequency. In July [2016], _mcr-1_ in _E. coli_ was identified from a patient specimen collected in New York in 2015 (3), and _mcr-2_, another colistin-resistance gene, was discovered in porcine and bovine _E. coli_ isolates (4). The emergence of these novel resistance mechanisms highlights the urgency of a more global and comprehensive approach to antimicrobial stewardship and preventing transmission of antibiotic-resistant pathogens between persons and institutions. Health care personnel should immediately report colistin-resistant bacteria to their local health department. Health departments are encouraged to rapidly investigate reports of colistin-resistant bacteria to prevent transmission to other patients and thereby decrease the risk for transmitting plasmid-encoded genes to bacteria that might already contain other resistance genes. The Pennsylvania Department of Health's investigation suggests that focused screening of contacts at highest transmission risk can be recommended.""

The _mcr-1_ gene was 1st reported in 2015 in food, animal, and patient isolates from China (1) and is notable for being the 1st plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanism to be identified. Plasmids can be transferred between bacteria, potentially spreading the resistance gene to other bacterial species. Since its discovery, the _mcr-1_ gene has been reported from Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, and North America (2,3), including the United States, where it has been identified in _Escherichia coli_ isolated from 3 patients and from 2 intestinal samples from pigs (2,4-6). In July 2016, the Pathogen Detection System at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, Maryland) identified _mcr-1_ in the whole genome sequence of an _E. coli_ isolate from a Connecticut patient (7); this is the 4th isolate from a U.S. patient to contain the _mcr-1_ gene.""The isolate was non-Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157 from stool collected on 16 Jun 2016 from a pediatric patient with diarrhea. The patient traveled to the Caribbean for approximately 2 weeks to visit friends and relatives and developed fever and bloody diarrhea on 12 Jun 2016, 2 days before returning to the United States. The patient took paromomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, from symptom onset until a pediatric outpatient visit on 16 Jun 2016, at which time a stool specimen was collected. The patient was not hospitalized and, in addition to the primary care visit, had one brief emergency department visit during the illness.""_E. coli_ O157 harboring _mcr-1_ was isolated from 3 stool cultures from the patient: the 16 Jun 2016 culture and follow-up cultures on 18 and 23 Jun 2016. Reference susceptibility testing by broth microdilution showed that the isolates had a colistin (also known as polymyxin E) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 ug/ml, and polymyxin B MIC of 4 ug/ml. The isolates also carried a plasmid _blacmy-2_ gene, which encodes AmpC, an enzyme that confers resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins; the isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Stool cultures on 24 Jun and 1 Jul 2016 were negative for _E. coli_ O157.""The patient's parent and health care provider were interviewed to assess patient risk factors and close contacts who might be at risk for acquiring bacteria carrying _mcr-1_. The patient was typically healthy with no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. The patient's usual diet included fruit, dairy products, and meat (pork, chicken, and beef). While traveling, the patient ate chicken and goat meat from a live animal market that the patient did not visit. The patient stayed in a home with a pet cat and dog in the Caribbean but did not have any animal contact in the United States.Persons with close contact with the patient, particularly those involved in bathing or diapering, were considered to be at risk for _mcr-1_ acquisition. On 19-20 Jul 2016, perirectal swabs were obtained from all 6 identified household contacts; a perirectal swab and swab of a soiled diaper from the patient were collected approximately 24 hours apart. Bacteria with the _mcr-1_ gene were not detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction in any specimen, indicating that the patient and family members were not colonized with bacteria carrying _mcr-1_. 16 environmental samples collected from surfaces in the kitchen and diaper changing area of the patient's home were negative for the presence of _mcr-1_. The patient did not have close contact with other persons after returning to the United States. Health care personnel had no direct contact with the patient's body fluids and were not screened.""In this investigation of potentially travel-associated _mcr-1_ acquisition, no transmission beyond the index patient or persistent environmental contamination were identified, and the patient was transiently colonized. At this time, CDC recommends that Enterobacteriaceae isolates with a colistin or polymyxin B MIC 4 ug/ml or more be tested for the presence of _mcr-1_; testing is available through CDC (5).* Prompt reporting of _mcr-1_-carrying isolates to public health officials allows for a rapid response to identify transmission and limit further spread.""References are available at the source URL. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
