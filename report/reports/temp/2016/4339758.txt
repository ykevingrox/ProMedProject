It occurred to us that simple counting of the cells which remained above the silicon plug could resolve this uncertainty.HIV viral load assay--------------------Warning regarding use of Becton Dickinson plasma preparation tubes (BD PPT tubes).BD Vacutainer Plasma Preparation Tube [PPT] is marketed as ""the industry standard, offering a one-step closed system for collection, plasma preparation, and transport of plasma while assuring sample integrity and reducing preanalytical errors. In addition, the BD PPT is the trusted product of choice for laboratorians concerned with biosafety and interested in high-quality plasma for molecular diagnostic testing. The BD PPT is IVD [in vitro diagnostic] and CE [European community] marked for Molecular Diagnostics.""Increasing automation enables the primary tube to be sampled robotically then assayed. In anticipation of this automation we commenced direct manual sampling of the PPT tube, which had variably been stored under recommended conditions for 1 to 2 days following the initial 1100 g x 20 minutes centrifugation. Previously the plasma had been aliquoted to storage tubes following the initial centrifugation step.This change in sample handling, to direct sampling from the stored PPT vacutainer tube, resulted in a high proportion of falsely elevated plasma viral load results. Patients who were compliant and confidently expected to be below detectable HIV levels were now returning viral loads of greater than 3 logs.Extensive literature has commented on this problem with BD PPT tubes and various speculations have been offered as to the source of the falsely elevated viral load. Further search revealed that the silicon plugs in PPT tubes were known to fail to achieve complete separation of WBC's [white blood cells] and platelets, although the extent of the plasma contamination has apparently not been recorded. We therefore resuspended the WBC remaining in the plasma fraction above the silicon plug after initial centrifugation and counted the residual cells. Flow analysis revealed a contamination of 105 WBC per ml of plasma. Thus the contamination is not trivial and represents 8 percent of the total WBC count. This WBC load closely accounts for the 3 log provirus contamination of the plasma fraction.BD recommends re-centrifugation of the primary PPT tube immediately before sampling and subsequent experience confirms that this step will eliminate the problem.We are concerned to ensure that all users of BD PPT tubes be aware of this WBC contamination. In particular, an appropriate pre-sampling centrifuge step should be built into robotic handling of primary PPT tubes.--Margaret C Croxson<kittyc@adhb.govt.nz>[It appears that the issues with PPT tubes have been noted previously by scientists in the field. 3 log 10 is a big difference and minimally, would trigger additional testing, such as drug resistance testing, and possibly an unnecessary treatment change. Since BD does recommend re-centrifugation of the primary PPT tube immediately before sampling, and that has been demonstrated to eliminate the problem, it is important that labs be made aware of the importance of adhering to this protocol.Any further information on this assay problem would be appreciated. - Mod.LK][See Also:Lymphogranuloma venereum - Czech Republic: incr., MSM, HIV coinfect., 2010-2015 20160320.4106603HIV - Europe: laboratory infection 2060225.4050454Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234].................................................lk/mj/ml"
