Radio Algerienne [in French, trans. & summ. Mod.AB, edited]<http://radioalgerie.dz/news/fr/article/20160116/64613.html>The proliferation of stray dogs through various districts and cities of the province of Blida [Algeria] is a real danger to the lives and safety of citizens, given the number of these ""wild"" animals that thrive there. The efforts made hitherto by the local authorities and departments concerned by their eradication have failed to put an end to this constant danger, raising fears of citizens to go out, particularly at night or early in the morning.According to citizens interviewed by the APS (Algeria Press Service), the presence in these cities of uncontrolled garbage dumps has contributed enormously to the proliferation of stray dogs in recent days. A situation considered ""intolerable"" is recognized especially in the towns of Blida, Ouled Aich, Beni Mered, Chifa, and Larbaa, whose residents strongly challenge the authorities for an effective response against this ""scourge"".The veterinary services of Blida Agricultural Services Directorate have identified 10 rabies outbreaks across the province, during the rabies vaccination campaign of 2015, compared to 16 outbreaks recorded the year before (2014). Veterinarians in the province are continuously warning citizens against dangerous diseases that these stray animals may transmit to humans, including leishmaniasis, and other communicable diseases, like rabies, which can cause death.Contacted by APS, officials from the hygiene services of the town of Blida have ensured that a mission was devoted, since last year [2015], to landfill garbage center (CET), Beni Mered, which is working in coordination with the municipalities in order to eradicate stray dogs. It has 2 adapted vehicles and a team specialized in this type of activity.This unit has already achieved many operations in the towns of Blida (140 stray dogs slaughtered), Mouzaia (67), Ouled Aich (100), and Chrea (125), according to the director of this center, Kara Smail, who added that a similar operation was launched last week in Bouguera. It is imperative, for the eradication of stray animals in the great Blida (including 4 districts), that the operation is carried out simultaneously in order to prevent leakage of dogs to nearby districts.--communicated by:ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[The proliferation of stray dogs in and around the cities in Algeria, as in most countries in Africa and the Middle East, is becoming more and more worrying as the danger posed by these animals, frequently moving in packs, threatens the physical integrity of citizens, not mentioning the potential risk of transmitting serious diseases such as rabies and leishmaniasis to humans.The growing population of these towns and cities does not allow public authorities to implement minimum health measures to prevent these animals from reaching domestic waste, feeding, and reproducing. The occasional slaughtering of stay animals does not suffice to reduce the density of abandoned canine and feline populations.Maps of Algeria can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Algeria.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31363>.

Bali Post reports that data published on Tuesday 12 Jan 2016, recorded 2 rabies bite cases affecting [a 13 year old boy] from Dajan Peken and [a 5 year old boy] from Kediri.The head of the Infectious Disease and Environmental Health Department (P2MPL) for the Tabanan Health Service, Wayan Triana Suryanata, revealed that [child no.1] suffered a bite to his left thigh and [child no.2] to his left ear. Adding, ""Tissue samples from both dogs that bit the children were tested and found positive for rabies.""Both children have been temporary administered antiviral treatment (VAR) while [child no.2] has been given anti-rabies serum (SAR) due to the location of his wound,near his head, considered to represent a more substantial threat.The father of [child no.1] said a neighbor's dog that was allowed to stray in the village bit his son: ""My son was just taking a walk when suddenly a dog appeared and bit him,"" he said. When the son was brought to a local health center to receive VAR he was told there was none of the free drug from the government available to treat the child. He then purchased VAR from another source that cost, together with treatment, Rp. 620 000 [about USD 44.55].Health officials killed the dog that bit the child and biopsy of the animal's brain that was performed on Monday, 11 Jan 2016, was positive for rabies. He has been promised follow up treatments of VAR at the local health center without charge.Meanwhile, the head of the health service for Tabanan, Dr Nyoman Suratmika, told the press that while VAR is available it is being dispensed selectively to only those with confirmed bites linked to a dog proven to have rabies. All patients reporting with dog bites have their wounds thoroughly cleaned with soap and water for 15 minutes.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] India - Maharashtra - human, fatalDate: Mon 18 Jan 2016Source: Times of India [edited] <http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Ahmednagar-senior-citizen-dies-of-rabies/articleshow/50620748.cms>A 62 year old man from Mirajgaon village in Ahmednagar district [Maharashtra state] succumbed to rabies at the Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital recently, taking the death count from the infection to 2 this year [2016], so far.The deceased, [K; full name withheld] was bitten by a puppy on his right foot in December 2015. ""Kolhe was admitted to our hospital around 1:40pm on 9 Jan 2016. He had developed classical symptoms of rabies like fear of water and air. He died around 7:10pm on 10 Jan [2016],"" civic health officials said.""It was a category III dog bite wound. As per the medical history given by the victim's relatives, K did not take anti-rabies vaccination on the scheduled days. Besides, he was not also administered rabies immunoglobulin, the readymade antibody which is extremely effective in deactivating the virus in category III dog bites,"" the officials said.As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the incubation period for the infection is typically 1-3 months, but may vary from one week to one year.The victims are usually injected a fast-acting readymade antibody, rabies immunoglobulin (RI), near the wound to deactivate the rabies virus. The readymade antibodies are given to the patient for immediate protection because the vaccine generally takes 14 days to produce antibodies.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to WHO criteria, the definition of Category III of contact with suspect rabid animal is: ""single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, licks on broken skin; contamination of mucous membrane with saliva from licks,"" as well as ""contacts with bats"".

The infected animals included 219 ferret-badgers, 2 masked palm civets, one dog, and one house shrew.Taitung is the county most affected by the outbreak, center chief Wu Tze-he said yesterday [21 Dec 2015]. This year [2015], Taitung County had seen 9 rabies infections among ferret-badgers and 2 infections in masked palm civets as of [10 Dec 2015], Council of Agriculture statistics show.As of [Tue 15 Dec 2015], 16 494 dogs and cats had been given rabies vaccinations in Taitung this year [2015], statistics show. The figure represents a vaccination rate of 57 per cent, Wu said. With such a low vaccination rate, ""dogs, cats, and people cannot be effectively protected,"" he said. If the vaccination rate among cats and dogs is more than 70 per cent, rabies transmissions between people and animals can be prevented, the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine said. Rabies infections in animals have been reported in 72 townships in 9 counties since 2013.Under the Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Disease, dog and cat owners are obliged to have their pets inoculated against rabies every year. Those who ignore the rule can be fined between TWD 30 000 [about USD 914] and TWD 150 000 [about USD 4572].[On 21 Dec 2015], 5 people were fined TWD 30 000 [about USD 914] each in Taitung for failing to have their 29 dogs vaccinated, even after the county government notified them of the requirement to do so.--communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[Rabies is a zoonosis whereby concerted actions are to be undertaken mostly by 2 main sectors: animal and human health.Zoonosis is the 3rd focus area of the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) 2010 and could exemplify a comprehensive and strong intersectoral collaboration to comply with the core capacity requirements under IHR(2005) [WHO's International Health regulations].The newswire above also reflects the need to maintain local capacities after attaining a certain required level of achievement.Maps of Taiwan can be seen at <http://www.tmf.org.tw/index.php/maps-taiwan-overall-english-cd> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5035>. - Mod.ST][After notifying 383 rabies cases since the start of the event in Taiwan (23 May 2012), the animal-health authorities submitted to the OIE their final follow-up report no.72 (final report) on 7 Jul 2014. It included the following epidemiological comments:""The Animal Health Research Institute (National Laboratory) has confirmed rabies virus infection by direct fluorescent antibody test in 2 ferret-badgers which were found in Hualien County and Yunlin County. The prefectural competent authorities have been conducting the intensified vaccination activities targeted at dogs and cats on the areas where infected ferret-badgers were found. The monitoring is ongoing. Reference is made to the guidelines of notification and the suggestions of OIE Animal Health Information Department, positive cases in new outbreaks after 1 Jul 2014 will be notified in the next 6-monthly report.""During 2014, there were 134 cases reported. The last available semi-annual report covers the months January-June 2015, during which period 48 cases in ferret-badgers were reported. As apparent from the current media report, the event in wildlife continues.On 10 and 11 Dec 2015, experts, donors, and veterinary and public health officials gathered in Geneva to adopt a plan of action towards the global elimination of dog-mediated human rabies worldwide. Subscribers are encouraged to approach the meeting's presentations during its 6 sessions and the posters, from all parts of the globe, available at <http://www.oie.int/eng/RABIES2015/index.html>.The meeting's conclusions were: ""1- The OIE and WHO strongly supported by FAO and GARC sustain their commitment to the elimination of dog mediated human rabies as a priority in the public interest and their collective efforts to foster political will and facilitate capacity building through existing and future programmes;""2- The proof of concept of the combination of mass dog vaccination, to achieve 70 per cent coverage of targeted populations, responsible dog ownership and dog population control in accordance with OIE intergovernmental standards, education for dog bite prevention and treatment and appropriate use of human post exposure prophylaxis is recognized as the foundation for guidance to countries wishing to pursue elimination of dog mediated human rabies;""3- The joint OIE/WHO mechanism for regional vaccine banks be promoted and supported to ensure the timely provision of quality vaccines to support the implementation of regional/national programs;""4- Regional strategies be developed or refined and validated in order to allow individual countries to adapt their approaches and investments to their local circumstances based on best practices in the establishment of national control programmes;""5- Countries are encouraged to support the establishment of good governance frameworks, including appropriate legislation, Veterinary Services supervision, community engagement and the implementation of local initiatives to demonstrate early success in order to leverage broader support and scale up their efforts;""6- All participants and other interested parties consider the global framework as refined and adopted at the conclusion of the Conference as the most effective means to achieve the elimination of dog mediated human rabies for participating countries by 2030."" - Mod.AS]
