Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/vibrio-vulnificus-forrest-county-resident-is-2nd-case-in-mississippi-43306/>Mississippi health officials have reported a 2nd case of _Vibrio vulnificus_ in a resident from Forrest County who contracted the bacterial infection in Mississippi gulf waters. This follows a previous case reported in a Hancock County man.The Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) says _V. vulnificus_ and other _Vibrio_ bacteria live in warm seawater. These bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to seawater, or when a person eats contaminated uncooked seafood.Eating raw shellfish -- especially oysters -- contaminated with _Vibrio_ may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Individuals with compromised immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease, are also likely to develop a bloodstream infection with fever and chills, blistering skin lesions and possibly death.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Mississippi can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4917>. Forrest and Hancock counties in southern Mississippi can be seen on the map at <http://geology.com/county-map/mississippi-county-map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThe manifestations of _V. vulnificus_ in this case are noted and it is unclear if the patient had risk factors for more serious disease. There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL]
