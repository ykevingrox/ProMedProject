Saccardi in recent days said the number of meningitis vaccinations has increased in the region, and the vaccination is free to all through age 45.In 2015, there were 38 cases of [meningococcal?] meningitis in the region.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Prior news reports indicate that the above news report is referring to meningococcal meningitis (<http://www.thelocal.it/20151006/meningitis-outbreak-spurs-vaccinations-in-tuscany>)._Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease [IMD] (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 percent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>). Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.IMD is reportedly rare in Italy, where 0.25 confirmed cases per 100 000 population were observed in 2011, whereas the rate for Europe as a whole was 0.77 (<http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/710656/#B2>).There are 12 serogroups, but the majority of invasive meningococcal infections are caused by organisms from the A, B, C, X, Y, or W-135 serogroups. Serogroup B and C have been responsible for the majority of IMD in Europe, but since implementation of conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine immunization programs, the frequency of IMD due to serogroup C has dropped; 73.6 percent of IMD was caused by serogroup B in Europe in 2011, while serogroup C accounted for only 14.4 percent of cases in 2011 (<http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/invasive-bacterial-diseases-surveillance-2011.pdf>).In Italy, since 2009-2010, most regions have established a universal infant free-of-charge meningococcal C conjugate vaccine program, reaching an average vaccination coverage of 68 percent in the 2008 birth cohort (<http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/710656/#B2>), and in the same period, 12 regions recommended the immunization of adolescents aged between 11 and 16 years, with one dose. The National Vaccination Plan 2012-2014 included meningococcal serogroup C conjugate universal routine vaccination for toddlers between 13 and 15 months of age and 11-18-year-old adolescents (<http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/710656/#B2>).Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/>). We are not told whether the strains of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C that are causing the current outbreak in Tuscany have been genotyped.Outbreaks of IMD caused by a strain _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C with a distinct genotype have recently occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France (<http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf>). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED-mail posts). It would be interesting to know whether any of the strains causing the Tuscany outbreak have a matching genotype and whether the genotype matches that causing the outbreak in MSM. ProMED-mail would appreciate information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.Tuscany is a region in central Italy with a population of about 3.8 million inhabitants (2013); the regional capital is Florence (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>.]
