The Barents Observer [edited]<http://thebarentsobserver.com/arctic/2016/07/urgent-evacuation-reindeer-herders-arctic-anthrax-outbreak-zone#.V5jRjCeyc1U.twitter>As many as 13 people are hospitalized and 1200 reindeer are dead on the tundra in Yamalo-Nenets autonomous region in what could be the largest natural anthrax outbreak in modern Russia. Laboratory analyses have proven the highly lethal bacterium causing the anthrax infection, Vesti Yamal reports.At the hospital in Salekhard, 13 people are isolated in the infectious department, the Governor's office informs, and 2 of the 4 children are under intensive care.In an emergency response, the Governor of Yamalo-Nenets AO in Western Siberia has ordered an urgent action to inoculate nomads in a larger area around the risk zone. Mass evacuation of the reindeer herders, including children, has started from the exposed areas. ""We have taken all measures to isolate the outbreak. Now, the most important thing is safety and health of our fellow citizens - the reindeer herders and specialists working in the quarantine zone,"" says Governor Dmitry Kobylin in a statement posted on the regional government's portal.The anthrax outbreak zone is around the Tarko-Sale tribe by the Pur River, south of Urengoy, some 540 km [approx. 335 mi] southeast of Salekhard, the capital of Yamalo-Nenets AO.Helicopters are flying in shuttle to evacuate the 12 nomad families out on the tundra. The TV-report by Vesti Yamal shows dead reindeer around. A mass vaccination is now happening. åÇAnthrax vaccine was given to 500 reindeer [on Tue 26 Jul 2016] and another 2500 will get vaccination today [Wed 27 Jul 2016], the Governor's office says.Initially it was believed that the many dead reindeer found on the tundra were due to the current heat wave in the region with temperatures above 30 deg C [approx. 86 deg F]. Now, it is confirmed that there is an anthrax outbreak on the Siberia tundra. The reindeer [carcasses] will be gathered and buried at a place where people and other reindeer will have to avoid for decades.Anthrax among people is uncommon in Northern Europe and Siberia. Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 24 percent.In 1979, it was believed [it did, Mod.MHJ] that a secret Soviet biological warfare laboratory in Sverdlovsk [today's Yekaterinburg] leaked anthrax aerosol through its ventilation system by accident. The following outbreak disease resulted in approximately 100 deaths, according to Wikipedia, although no official information was ever released.[Byline: Thomas Nilsen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[2]Date: Wed 27 Jul 2016, 9:25 AM ETSource: NBC News [edited]<http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/heat-wave-sparks-anthrax-outbreak-russia-s-yamalo-nenets-area-n617716>As many as 13 members of a nomadic Siberian community have been hospitalized after a heat wave thawed the carcass of an anthrax-infected reindeer and sparked an outbreak of the disease. Around 1500 of the animals have died from the highly infectious disease since [Sun 24 Jul 2016], the government of Russia's Yamalo-Nenets autonomous district announced on its website [Tue 26 Jul 2016].A state of emergency has been imposed throughout the region in western Siberia due to the incident -- the 1st of its kind since 1941. The carcass of a reindeer thought to have died from anthrax decades ago thawed and released the bacteria, sending the disease rippling through a population of animals already weakened by unusually high temperatures, according to local officials. Temperatures in the Yamal tundra above the Arctic Circle have hit highs of 95 deg F [approx. 35 deg C] this summer, compared to an average of 77 deg F [approx. 25 deg C].At least 63 members of the Nenet community have been relocated as a result of the outbreak, their tents disinfected and children sent to a boarding school, the government said. The Nenets are traditional deer-herders and their livelihoods are linked to the animals.A mass vaccination of reindeer is underway in the region, local officials said. It may be too late for many of the animals because anthrax can kill deer within 3 days of infecting them, Vladimir Bogdanov, a biology professor with the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the RBC news website. Yamal authorities stopped vaccinating reindeer 10 years ago because there had been no outbreaks for more than half-a-century -- an apparent mistake, Bogdanov added.Local authorities said they were considering the best way to dispose of dead reindeer. The usual method -- burning -- has severe risks in the tundra, as much of Siberia is already engulfed in wildfires.Anthrax has a mortality rate of 25 to 80 percent, depending on a strain. It was explored as a biological weapon by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, though never used. Anthrax bacteria can remain dormant in dead bodies for decades, spreading to living organisms when exposed to them.[Byline: Alexey Eremenko]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Tue 26 Jul 2016Source: The Siberian Times [edited]<http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0686-first-anthrax-outbreak-since-1941-9-hospitalised-with-two-feared-to-have-disease/>[The article adds little of additional value but it has an excellent map showing where the outbreak occurred and photographs of the region. It is flat tundra and far above the tree line. The evacuated children are to be placed temporarily in a boarding school in Yar-Sale. - Mod.MHJ][While burning was initially considered it is now held to be of excessive risk because of existing wildfires. The map in the 3rd article indicates that will take a minimum of 14 hours to drive to the affected area from Salekhard with digging equipment. In spite of the heat once they get down a meter or so the ground will be frozen. It will be interesting to see what is finally decided and actually accomplished. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54486>.]
