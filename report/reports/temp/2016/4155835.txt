An ongoing spike in the number of gonorrhea cases across the state has the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services worried.State officials said the gonorrhea caseload has roughly doubled in each of the past 2 years to 845 cases in 2015, according to preliminary data about the latest tally of sexually transmitted diseases. In comparison Montana tracked 433 new cases in 2014 and 224 new cases in 2013.Jim Murphy, chief of the department's Communicable Disease Bureau, said the department is troubled about what is happening in population centers such as Missoula County, which saw its number of gonorrhea cases jump from 22 in 2014 to 74 in 2015. The numbers are even higher in some other population centers in the state and in some reservation counties.A map from the department shows that the rate of gonorrhea cases was greatest in Big Horn, Roosevelt, Rosebud, and Glacier counties -- homes of the Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Fort Peck, and Blackfeet Indian reservations, respectively. In those 4 counties, there were greater than 150 cases per 100 000 people in 2015. Murphy said the alarming data about gonorrhea holds one bright spot å - the increasing numbers of cases means, in part, that the medical community is doing a better job of identifying cases. ""Once you find a case of gonorrhea, a good health department is going to find additional cases because of the follow-up work,"" Murphy said, adding that testing, too, is better now. But the spike in numbers is too great to say that it's simply better detection. It's clear that the disease is being transmitted more often, he said.The number of _Chlamydia_ cases reported in 2015 was similar to the prior year, but the general trend continues to show a gradual increase with more than 4100 cases reported. 2 other major sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, are holding steady, without the alarming increase that is visible in the gonorrhea data. Montana tracked 13 primary and secondary infections of syphilis in 2015 å - recent cases, in other words å - including 3 cases in Missoula County. There were also 3 in Yellowstone County, 2 in Gallatin, and one each in Big Horn, Richland, Hill, Flathead, and Lake counties.There are currently 19 new HIV cases reported in 2015, one of which involved a person relocating to Montana and the other 18 of which involved Montanans. Judy Nielsen of the department's STD-HIV Prevention Section said from what the department can track on its websites, its awareness campaign is helping convince people to get tested for HIV. The department posts billboards around the state on a rotating basis urging people to get checked for HIV and recommending that they visit a website, <http://getcheckedmt.org>. From 2014 to 2015, Nielsen said, the number of hits at that website doubled. The good news about dealing with HIV, Nielsen said, is that with early detection and treatment, someone with HIV can now live to within 5 years of a normal lifespan. And, Murphy added, keeping treatment up to date greatly reduces the risk of transmission. 2 Montana counties å - Missoula and Yellowstone -å  now have more than 50 people living with HIV, according to the health department's data.[Byline: Lance Nixon]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Montana, with a population of about 1 million in 2015, is a state in the northwestern region of the United States, and has a large Native American population, which constitute the majority in 3 counties: Big Horn, Glacier, and Roosevelt (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana>). Missoula County, with a population of 109 426 in 2010, is the 2nd-most populous county in Montana; the county's largest city is Missoula, where the University of Montana is located (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula_County,_Montana>).A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the state can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/228> and a county map at <http://geology.com/county-map/montana-county-map.gif>.The news report above says that cases of gonorrhea in Montana have doubled each year in the past 2 years (incidence rate of 84.5 per 100 000 in 2015), but the incidence rate of gonorrhea was greatest in Big Horn, Roosevelt, Rosebud, and Glacier counties å - homes of the Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Fort Peck, and Blackfeet Indian reservations, where the incidence rates of gonorrhea were over 150 per 100 000. The news report also singles out Missoula County, where that incidence has also increased dramatically, with an incidence rate of 67.6 per 100 000 in 2015. However, the cases of gonococcal disease in Montana were not further characterized. For comparison, the rate for the US as a whole was 110.7 per 100 000 in 2014, the latest year for which national data are available, when the rate in Montana was 42.8 per 100 000 (<http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/tables/13.htm>).Discussions of gonococcal infection can be found in my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail post listed below. - Mod.ML]
