Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-reports-additional-h7n9-avian-influenza-case-from-guangdong-58814/>Chinese health officials are reporting an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) on the mainland, according to provincial health officials.According to the Health and Family Planning Commission (HFPC) of Guangdong Province, the 74-year-old male patient lived in Meizhou, Guangdong.""H5 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses can cause severe infections in humans. Due to the seasonal pattern, our risk assessment shows that the activity of avian influenza viruses is expected to remain at a high level in winter months. Increased numbers of human H5N6 and H7N9 cases have been recorded in the Mainland since this winter. Locally, birds positive for H5N6 were also detected this winter.""The public, particularly poultry traders, travellers and those who may visit the Mainland in the coming Lunar New Year [February 2016], should be highly alert. Do not visit poultry markets and farms. Avoid poultry contact. We will continue to monitor the regional and global disease situation,"" a spokesman for the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection noted.From 2013 to date [28 Jan 2016], 682 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[China began reporting infections with A(H7N9) in people in spring of 2013. Most of these infections have been associated with contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets) in China. However, it is not stated whether that is how this individual and the man in the post [2] were infected. - Mod.LK]******[2] China (Hunan) H7N9Date: Wed 27 Jan 2016Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h7n9-avian-flu-reported-in-hunan-province-99899/>A 33-year-old man from Xintian County, Hunan Province has been confirmed positive for avian influenza A(H7N9), according to the Hunan Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission.The patient is currently hospitalized and receiving treatment for his illness.This is the 701st human H7N9 avian influenza reported from Mainland China (681) and 20 exported cases to several countries.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection).The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza through close contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings.Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian flu. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>******[3] CDC guidance on exposure to infected birdsDate: Tue 26 Jan 2016Source: CDC [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h5/infected-birds-exposure.htm>Information for People Exposed to Birds Infected with Avian Influenza Viruses of Public Health Concern--------------------------------------------------------------------------------You are being given this information and these instructions because you were recently around poultry or wild birds found to be infected with avian influenza viruses (""bird flu"") of public health concern. Some avian influenza viruses have caused rare, sporadic infections in people, resulting in human illness ranging from mild to severe. These viruses are of public health concern because of their ability to cause human illness and also because of their potential to cause a pandemic.Infected birds shed bird flu virus in their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare, but they can happen when enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Most often these infections have occurred after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses. However, some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.Because human infections with these viruses are possible, all people with exposure to birds infected with avian influenza viruses of public health concern and people with exposure to surfaces contaminated with these viruses should be monitored for illness for 10 days after their last exposure. State and local health departments are helping to monitor people's health and you should contact your health department if you get any of the symptoms listed on this fact sheet during the 10 days after your last exposure. By following the instructions below, you can help ensure that you receive prompt medical evaluation, possible testing and appropriate treatment if you become ill with signs and symptoms that could be due to bird flu.Instructions:1. Monitor your health for symptoms of avian influenza virus infection.2. Call your state/local health department immediately if you develop any illness signs or symptoms during the 10-day observation period.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Additional detail may be found at the source URL above. This guidance is not only for A(H7N9), but other avian flu viruses as well including A(H5N1) and A(H5N6). The majority of human cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly cooked food.Maps of China can be found at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Mod.LK]
