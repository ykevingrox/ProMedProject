Classified as a primary case with high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness still under investigation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Well, in the update with yesterday's 2 newly confirmed cases, I observed that there were continued sporadic cases being reported in Saudi Arabia, with a high proportion of newly reported cases classified as primary cases. In the past 48 hours there have been 5 newly reported cases (2 yesterday and 3 today), all of whom were classified as primary cases, 3 with a known history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and 2 still under investigation for possible high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.Today's 3 cases come from 3 different regions, well visualized in the map of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the cases found at the source URL. Alzulfi is located in the Riyadh region, approximately 260 km [160 miles] to the northwest of Riyadh city. Arar is located in the Al Hudud ash Shamaliyah region, in the northeast of the country near to the border with Iraq, and Buqayq is located in the Eastern region, and according to Wikipedia is a Saudi Aramaco gated community located in the desert 60 km [about 40 miles] to the southwest of the Dhahran-Dammam-Khobar metropolitan area (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abqaiq>).With the increase in reporting of sporadic cases in recent days (since 1 Nov 2016 there have been a total of 13 newly confirmed cases, all of whom were classified as primary cases, compared with a total of 14 cases reported during the month of October 2016, 5 of whom were secondary cases and 9 of whom were primary cases) one wonders if this is reflecting a seasonal increase in transmission or if this reflects a greater sensitivity on the part of clinicians -- ""seek and ye shall find.""The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
