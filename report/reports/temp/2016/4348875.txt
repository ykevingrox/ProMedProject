CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/07/news-scan-jul-14-2016>The latest global flu report from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests flu has peaked in Brazil, but flu cases are steadily rising in parts of Latin America and in southern Africa.The 2009 H1N1 virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the main viruses detected in tropical South America, with Colombia and Bolivia reporting increased cases. Influenza detection has seemed to peak in Brazil, and flu activity and hospitalizations have decreased in both Peru and Ecuador.In Central America, the number of hospitalizations due to pneumonia peaked in El Salvador. Over the past few weeks, Panama has reported decreasing levels of influenza A. Most Caribbean countries are also reporting decreased flu activity. According to the WHO, RSV activity continued in Costa Rica and Guatemala.Influenza B detection increased in southern Africa, a trend noted in the WHO's 29 Jun [2016] update. The agency continues to report that flu activity remains low for this time of year in Australia and New Zealand.Internationally, influenza A was responsible for 56.5 percent of all flu cases, with influenza B causing the rest. Of influenza A viruses subtyped, 74 percent have been 2009 H1N1.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The WHO global update on seasonal influenza (Influenza (27): WHO global update, seasonal 20160715.4344014) has highlighted the increasing influenza activity particularly for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.Based on the WHO classification of influenza transmission zones (<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/Influenza_transmission_zones.pdf?ua=1>), countries in South America fall in the temperate (Argentina, Chile, Falkland Islands, Paraguay and Uruguay) and tropical (Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, Guyana, French Guyana and Suriname) zones. Countries like El Salvador, Panama, and Guatemala are classified in the Central America Caribbean zone.In temperate regions, there are clear seasonal variations in the occurrence of influenza, with a marked peak in cold winter months (Simonsen L (1999). The global impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality. Vaccine 17: S3-S10). In contrast, seasonality is less defined in tropical regions -- here, there is high background influenza activity throughout the year, on top of which epidemics occur at intermediate months between the influenza season in temperate countries of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.It is important to monitor the activity and types of influenza viruses in circulation, so that health planners can be advised on vaccination priorities accordingly. Furthermore, studies are needed to understand the influenza seasonality patterns across a large range of latitudes, representing tropical and subtropical countries in both hemispheres. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186>.]
