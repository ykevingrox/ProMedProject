Wisconsin Department of Health Services [edited]<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/elizabethkingia.htm>The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), Division of Public Health (DPH) is currently investigating an outbreak of bacterial infections caused by _Elizabethkingia anophelis_. The majority of patients acquiring these infections are over 65 years old, and all patients have a history of at least one underlying serious illness.The department quickly identified effective antimicrobial treatment for elizabethkingia, and has alerted health care providers, infection preventionists and laboratories statewide. Since the initial guidance was sent on 15 Jan 2016, there has been a rapid identification of cases, and healthcare providers have been able to treat and improve outcomes for patients. DHS continues to provide updates of outbreak-related information that includes laboratory testing, infection control and treatment guidance.At this time, the source of these infections is still unknown, and the department continues to work diligently to control this outbreak. Disease detectives from the department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are conducting a comprehensive investigation which includes:- interviewing patients with _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ infection and/or their families to gather information about activities and exposures related to healthcare products, food, water, restaurants, and other community settings;- obtaining environmental and product samples from facilities that have treated patients with _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ infections. To date, these samples have tested negative, and there is no indication the bacterium was spread by a single healthcare facility;- conducting a review of medical records;- obtaining nose and throat swabs from individuals receiving care on the same units in health care facilities as a patient with a confirmed _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ to determine if they are carrying the bacteria. To date, all of these specimens tested negative, which suggests the bacterium is not spreading from person to person in healthcare settings;- obtaining nose and throat swabs from household contacts of patients with confirmed cases to identify if there may have been exposure in their household environment;- performing a ""social network"" analysis to examine any commonalities shared between patients including healthcare facilities or shared locations or activities in the community.Wisconsin 2016 _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ outbreak:Case counts between 1 Nov 2015 and 20 Apr 2016----------------------------------------------Confirmed = 59Under investigation = 0Possible cases = 4Total cases reported to Wisconsin DPH = 63Affected counties include Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Washington, Waukesha and Winnebago.There have been 18 deaths among individuals with confirmed _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ infection and one additional death among possible cases, making a total of 19 deaths. It has not been determined whether these deaths were caused by the infection or other serious pre-existing health problems. Counties where these deaths occurred are: Columbia, Dodge, Fond du lac, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Washington and Waukesha.This investigation is ongoing. Case counts may change as additional illnesses are identified and more cases are laboratory confirmed. The possible cases are ones that tested positive for elizabethkingia but will never be confirmed as the same strain of _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ because the outbreak specimens are no longer available to test.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[No additional cases or deaths have been reported this week in Wisconsin or other states. Below, however, is a posting of additional cases in Illinois of infection with _E. anophelis_ thought not to be related to the current outbreak. - Mod.LL]******[2] IllinoisDate: Wed 20 Apr 2016Source: CNN [edited]<http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/20/health/elizabethkingia-illinois-cluster/>A new cluster of elizabethkingia infection, previously rarely seen in humans, has been found in Illinois, health officials said Wed 20 Apr 2016.Testing by CDC confirmed _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ infection in 10 Illinois residents, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Six of those individuals have died. Most of the infected patients had underlying health conditions, and it's unknown whether they died from the infection or pre-existing conditions.The Illinois cluster of cases is a different strain of infection from the one identified in an ongoing elizabethkingia outbreak in Wisconsin, first reported in March 2016. 59 cases have been confirmed in that state since November 2015. 18 have died. Officials there have said all of those infected had ""at least one serious underlying illness"", and most are older than 65. The Illinois cases began in 2014.Dr Chris Braden, deputy director at CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said this cluster of cases in Illinois is not surprising but it is concerning.Federal and state health officials asked health care providers and health departments to be on the lookout for cases of Elizabethkingia last month [March 2016]. These bacteria are not mandated or voluntarily reported, so clusters may have previously gone unnoticed. ""We are identifying this because Illinois really looked for it,"" Braden said. Last week, the Illinois Department of Public Health said it found one case of the same strain of elizabethkingia identified in the Wisconsin outbreak. That person died earlier in 2016.In March 2016, health officials in Michigan also found a case of the infection that matched the strain of the Wisconsin outbreak.""Although this strain of Elizabethkingia is different than the one seen in the Wisconsin outbreak, our investigatory methods remain the same, and we continue to work with the CDC and our local health departments to investigate this cluster of cases and develop ways to prevent additional infections,"" said Dr Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.The bacterium is commonly found in soil, river water and reservoirs but does not commonly cause illness in humans. People with compromised immune systems or serious underlying health conditions are more at risk of infection. Previous outbreaks have been associated with health care settings. Most of the infections have been in the bloodstream, although some have been in the respiratory system or joints.Symptoms of elizabethkingia infection include fever, shortness of breath, chills and a bacterial skin infection called cellulitis. The infection is often antibiotic resistant and difficult to treat.Health officials have not yet found the source of the Wisconsin outbreak. Braden said the Illinois investigation is starting by gathering information about each individual case, including where the person lived, what health care they were receiving and what facilities they had been to.It will also consider what type of infection the person had; for example, was it in the bloodstream or on the skin? Because the strains are different officials, are operating under the assumption that the Illinois and Wisconsin cases are unrelated. However, there is a possibility that the investigation could find they are related; for example, exposure to the same product.""Previously, health providers were not required to report individual cases of elizabethkingia, so it is difficult to determine the degree and kind of exposure that results in illness. For the same reason, it is difficult to estimate how many cases of illness actually occur each year,"" a statement from the Illinois health department said. Braden said: ""We haven't really been looking for clusters with this particular organism; it's possible we could see others as states request laboratories look for these and request them.""With the source still under investigation, health officials said the best way to prevent this and other infections is to follow ""good health practices"", including frequently washing hands and requesting health care providers do the same.[byline: Debra Goldschmidt]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These earlier Illinois cases of _E. anophelis_ infection are not the same strain as the current outbreak mostly in the adjacent state of Wisconsin. It is apparent that a ""look back"" by hospitals in the state produced these reports, but it is not reported specifically whether these cases are the same or whether they are geographically related in a portion of the state as the Wisconsin cases are. In addition, since it has been previously stated that only CDC has had the capacity to distinguish _E. anophelis_ from _E. meningoseptica_, it is likely that these were all blood culture isolates, since many hospital labs save isolates from the blood.I hope that other states will have their hospitals perform similar look backs to see whether similar outbreaks have occurred, not only in the Midwestern part of the USA but in other areas as well. Identifying a geographic range may assist in finding the correct epidemiologic niche for this bacterium related to these cases.As a reminder regarding antimicrobial sensitivities of the outbreak strain (from Wisconsin Department of Health Services, For Health Professionals <https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/elizabethkingia.htm>): Although elizabethkingia are multidrug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) conducted at Wisconsin clinical microbiology laboratories of recent isolates of elizabethkingia demonstrated that most of the isolates tested are susceptible to fluoroquinolones, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. AST (MIC [minimum inhibitory concentration] testing) and characterization of strains has been conducted at CDC on 9 isolates of elizabethkingia from blood specimens collected from Wisconsin residents. These isolates include 5 _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ with PFGE [pulse field gel electrophoresis] outbreak pattern 1, 3 isolates of _E. anophelis_ with non-outbreak PFGE patterns and one isolate of _Elizabethkingia_ species. These MIC results demonstrate susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, minocycline, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The medical literature suggests combination treatment with these agents may be more effective than monotherapy. Whenever possible, treatment should be guided by AST.The organism was first characterized in a 2011 report (1), isolated from the midgut of _Anopheles gambiae_. A PubMed search found several reports of human infection, an 8 day old girl with meningitis from the Central African Republic (2), 2 neonates with meningitis in Hong Kong of whom one of the mothers had chorioamnionitis with the organism (3), and an intensive care unit cluster of 5 cases from Singapore (4). Since it can be easily confused with _E. meningoseptica_ (an organism previously referred to as _Flavobacterium meningosepticum_ and then _Chryseobacterium meningosepticum_), other cases may well have occurred. All of these cases were nosocomial in origin unlike, apparently, the Wisconsin/Michigan cases.References----------1.
