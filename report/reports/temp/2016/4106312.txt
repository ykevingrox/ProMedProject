Xinhua [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-03/19/c_135204484.htm>The Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning on Saturday [19 Mar 2016] announced 2 more imported yellow fever cases, days after the nation's 1st imported case was confirmed in the capital.In the new cases, one patient surnamed Yang showed fever symptoms in Angola on 9 Mar [2016] and flew back to Beijing a week later. He was confirmed to have contracted the virus upon seeking medical advice.The other patient developed symptoms on 11 Mar [2016] in Angola and arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport on Thursday [17 Mar 2016]. He was sent to hospital after quarantine officers found his fever symptoms.The 2 patients, both aged 44, had not been vaccinated before they went to Angola. One of them hailed from east China's Fujian Province and the other from southwest China's Sichuan Province.Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly found in tropical regions of Africa and Central and South America.China's National Health and Family Planning Commission on Sunday [13 Mar 2016] confirmed the 1st imported yellow fever case of a 32-year-old Chinese man, who had also returned from Angola, in Beijing.Shanghai reported a yellow fever case on Friday [18 Mar 2016]. A 46-year-old man from the eastern province of Jiangsu 1st experienced fever symptoms on 5 Mar [2016] while in Angola and returned to China on 7 Mar [2016].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[These are the 3rd and 4th yellow fever (YF) cases imported from Angola into China. One wonders how many more of the Chinese workers in Angola are unvaccinated and at risk of YF virus infections. If the Angola YF outbreak continues, the risk of introduction of the virus by viremic unvaccinated workers into southern China where dengue virus transmission occurs will increase during the warmer mosquito vector season. Mosquitoes that transmit dengue viruses can also transmit yellow fever virus. Chinese health authorities are wise to maintain surveillance of incoming travelers from Angola to detect, isolate and treat febrile individuals. The dengue-endemic provinces of China are Hainan, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang Yunnan and Guangdong (there were 40 000 cases reported in Guangdong during June-October 2014) and 3 of the current yellow fever cases identified so far were en route to their homes in Zhejiang (which borders Shanghai, the largest city in the world, with an estimated population of 243 million, though reportedly dengue-free) and Fujian. So China has now has a few weeks for advance planning.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.A map of China can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Mods.TY/JW]
