However, treatment for them would continue at the Paderu Area Hospital, Superintendent of KGH M. Madhusudhana Babu has informed. All of them except 2 are almost cured and treatment is needed for a few more days for the 2 patients. The PO [project officer] of ITDA [Integrated Tribal Development Agency], Paderu and the DMHO [District Medical and Health Department Offices] have been alerted to bring the patients to the Paderu hospital.On Wed 4 May [2016] evening, 5 of the patients sought the doctors' permission to go to their native villages to participate in the annual Modakondamma Jatara, an important festival of the region and particularly for the Girijans. However, at 4 am on Thu 5 May [2016] ""all the 19 have left the hospital without informing us,"" Dr. Madhusudhana Babu said.In a major spurt of cutaneous anthrax after many years in the Agency area, 16 patients from Panasapalli in Hukumpeta mandal and 19 [patients from] 2 villages from G. Madugula mandal were admitted in KGH with suspected cutaneous anthrax. Clinically they were diagnosed as suffering with cutaneous anthrax and treatment started and it showed results. A total of 19 remained in the hospital while the rest were discharged.A 2-member team of scientists from DRDE [Defence Research and Development Establishment], Gwalior visited KGH and collected samples from the patients for tests like ELISA to be done in their laboratory. All the patients have consumed meat of dead animals, reportedly contaminated with anthrax. Several heads of cattle and goats have died suddenly in these villages in the recent past, reportedly due to anthrax.[Byline: G.Narasimha Rao]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Fair comment when an important festival is at hand. Anthrax is a non-contagious disease so they will present no risk to their relatives. And hospitals are full of sick people. - Mod.MHJMaps of India can be seen at<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37917>. - CopyEd.AO]
