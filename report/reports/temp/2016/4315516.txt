The Olympian [edited]<http://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article86320247.html>More [Puget] South Sound beaches have been closed to shellfish harvesting after tests have come back positive for diarrhetic shellfish poison, a biotoxin that makes food unsafe to eat, according to a news release.The closure starts at Henderson Passage and continues northeast to Johnson Point, and then stretches south, covering all of Henderson Inlet.Shellfish harvesting is prohibited on beaches along that shoreline.Previous closures are still in effect at Squaxin Passage, along all of Budd Inlet and at Boston Harbor.Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning is a biotoxin that, if ingested, can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Symptoms can begin 30 minutes to 12 hours after eating and feel similar to those of food poisoning, said Art Starry, Environmental Health Division Director for Thurston County Public Health and Social Services. Most symptoms will subside after 72 hours.The state Department of Health's 24-hour Shellfish Safety Hotline can be accessed at 800-562-5632, or visit the department's shellfish closure map at <https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/eh/maps/biotoxin/biotoxin.html>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is one type of shellfish poisoning.Okadaic acid is a naturally occurring marine toxin, called a ""biotoxin,"" that is produced by microscopic algae, specifically, the dinoflagellate _Dinophysis_. Shellfish eat these algae and can retain the toxin, sometimes at levels that can make people sick. Okadaic acid causes DSP in humans who eat shellfish contaminated with the toxin.All species of shellfish including clams, mussels, oysters, geoducks [very large, edible saltwater clams] and scallops are able to accumulate DSP toxin.Shellfish containing toxic levels of DSP do not look or taste any different from shellfish that are safe to eat. Laboratory testing of shellfish meat is the only known method of detecting DSP.DSP causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, with diarrhea being the most commonly reported symptom. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. Anyone who eats DSP contaminated shellfish is at risk for illness. The DSP toxin is non-lethal to humans.Other types of biotoxins found in the northwest are paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning (caused by consumption of the biotoxin domoic acid). Harmful bacteria and viruses can cause intestinal upset such as vibriosis (vibrio illness) from shellfish and norovirus from shellfish. Some people can have an allergic reaction to shellfish.If symptoms are mild, call your health care provider and your local public health agency. If symptoms are severe, call 911 or have someone take you to your family doctor.Portions of this comment were extracted from <http://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/Shellfish/BiotoxinsIllnessPrevention/Biotoxins/DiarrheticShellfishPoisoning>. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4650>.]
