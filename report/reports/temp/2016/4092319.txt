It is not always clear whether the dates of onset of symptoms and dates of admission to hospital reflect the dates of onset of MERS-CoV compatible illness or whether these are admissions for other medical/health reasons in individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities. In addition, some individuals who are classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases in patients were admitted to the hospital symptomatic and were positive for MERS-CoV infection within 24 hours (see case No. 2 above).  Of the 25 cases presented in this update, 13 were from Buraidah, with only one of these 13 cases classified as a primary case with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of symptoms (see case No. 6), and 2 cases were classified as primary cases without a history of contact with camels (see cases No.16 and 18 above). Of interest is that the 1st confirmed case in the Buradiah outbreak (case No. 18) was admitted to the hospital on 22 Feb 2016 but developed worsening symptoms on 28 Feb 2016. So the key question remains, where was the initial exposure to the MERS-CoV for this 1st confirmed MERS-CoV infected patient?Returning to the other 12 non-Buraidah outbreak-associated reported cases, 5 were classified as primary cases with a history of contact with camels (cases Nos. 8, 11, 20, 21, and 23); 4 were classified as primary cases but no history of contact with camels (cases Nos.4, 17, 24, and 25). Two were classified as household contacts of a previously confirmed case (Nos. 19, 22), and one was pending classification (No 15, a healthcare worker).  Cases were reported from Riyadh (5 cases), and 1 each from Jeddah,  Arruwaidhah, Muhayil, Al Artawiyah, Shaqra, Alrass, and Alzulfi.It is curious that of the 25 cases reported above, 4 (cases Nos. 12, 13, 17, and 22) 1st tested negative for MERS-CoV and upon re-test were positive; one question that comes to mind is the level of infection control for patients when they test negative for MERS-CoV and whether these individuals could be a source for transmission during this negative interval before testing positive.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
