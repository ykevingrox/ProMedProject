Also, Liberian officials convened an emergency meeting today [1 Apr 2016] to coordinate the response.Two countries addressing flare-ups----------------------------------Liberia becomes the 2nd country in the outbreak region -- alongside Guinea -- to report re-emergence of the disease. The new case seems to underscore a warning earlier this week [week of 28 Mar 2016] from WHO officials that despite the end of the public health emergency of international concern for Ebola, sporadic cases are likely to occur because of lingering virus in the survivor population.Liberia's flare-up is the country's 3rd since its initial outbreak was declared over in May 2015. Its most recent cluster occurred in November 2015 and ended in the middle of January [2016].Confirmation of Liberia's latest case marks the region's 13th recurrence of the disease. The Ebola virus can linger in immune-protected parts of the body, such as eyes and testes, and sexual transmission has been suspected as the source of some recent illness clusters.Over 1000 contacts in Guinea----------------------------Neighboring Guinea is battling an outbreak centered near a village in the southern Nzerekore district, where 9 cases and 7 deaths have been reported [since late February 2016].In a recent update on the response to Guinea's Ebola cluster, the WHO said more than 1000 contacts have been identified and nearly 800 were immunized with VSV-EBOV [vesicular stomatitis virus-Ebola virus vaccine] in a ring vaccination campaign that it is coordinating. In a large earlier trial in Guinea, VSV-EBOV, developed by Canadian scientists and licensed by NewLink Genetics and Merck, was found to be highly effective, and it has been tested and deployed in other Ebola clusters.The WHO has sent a 75-member team to help local officials in Guinea, as well as 2 clinicians to help in Nzerekore's Ebola treatment center.[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[According to WHO, 6 of the deceased individuals are from 3 generations of the same extended family in Koropara village. - Mod.LK]******[2] Liberia  re-emergenceDate: Fri 1 Apr 2016Source: Reuters Africa [edited]<http://af.reuters.com/article/nigeriaNews/idAFL5N1742QB>Liberia suffers new Ebola death, months after outbreak declared over- WHO says West Africa epidemic no longer global risk- But some cases continue to emerge- Liberia closed border after new cases in Guinea (adds confirmation by government and WHO)A woman has died of Ebola in Liberia, months after the West African nation was declared free of the virus and weeks after neighbouring Guinea also recorded a new flare-up, health officials said on [Fri 1 Apr 2016].The 30-year-old woman was being brought to a hospital in the capital Monrovia on [Thu 31 Mar 2016] after falling ill, but died before she arrived, separate statements from Liberia's health ministry and the World Health Organization (WHO) said.A health official said that she had previously been admitted to a clinic in Paynesville, just east of Monrovia.

The great progress on vaccines may be undermined by the fading of memories of the impact Ebola virus disease (EVD) has had on West Africa and the world.According to Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity which co-led a report on the world's progress towards [EVD] immunization, ""As Ebola infection rates come under control it's a huge concern that complacency sets in, attention moves to more immediate threats and Ebola vaccine development is left half-finished.""A total of 13 [EVD] vaccine candidates -- including different combinations of injections -- were tested in early- and mid-stage clinical trials.]31 Mar 2016: Scientists develop alternative for Ebola screening program<http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/stories/510704372-scientists-develop-alternative-for-ebola-screening-program>[In a study recently published in the journal Preventive Medicine details a potential alternative scientists have developed to replace the Ebola entry screening program in place at US airports.Because of how the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] progresses, health professionals decided an exit- as well as entry-screening program for international travelers is needed at US airports.  The proposed new approach uses social-contact tracing to determine the risk level and spread of the disease which will assist experts in creating a more strategic system for locating potential [EVD] cases.][This seems to me to be an impractical suggestion.  It adds an extra dimension to the entry questionnaire that is no more likely to to be answered truthfully than the current questionnaire.  Is it seriously expected that people who are likely to exchange body fluids with a person in the USA, like the Liberian who died in Houston and the US doctor who fell ill in New York, will declare that possibility?  And neither of them transmitted Ebola to their sexual contacts in any case.- Mod.JW][The study cited above isJacobson SH, Yu G, Jokela JA: A double-risk monitoring and movement restriction policy for Ebola entry screening at airports in the United States.
