They also state that individuals who received the vaccination should not require another during the 10 year period, but that if they do receive another dose, a new 10 year protective period begins from that point. They also note that the certificate of vaccination becomes effective 10 days after the date it is administered. (<http://ao.chineseembassy.org/chn/sghd/t1350179.htm> in Chinese, trans. Dan Silver)On [24 Mar 2016], the Embassy issued another message saying that Chinese citizens in Angola who have not been vaccinated, or who have passed the 10 year period of protection, should immediately get boosters.An article in Xinhua [news agency] says that at least 6 Chinese workers in Angola are suspected to have died from yellow fever, according to an Embassy statement. (<http://news.xinhuanet.com/world/2016-03/22/c_1118409108.htm> in Chinese, trans. Dan Silver)--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Dan Silver[With 6 deaths that are suspected yellow fever (YF) cases, it is likely that there are several more non-fatal cases among the thousands of Chinese workers in Angola. This situation underscores the need for individuals who will be traveling to YF endemic areas, such as Angola, to be vaccinated at least 11 days before arrival there. One hopes that the Chinese Embassy's advisory is heeded for all Chinese workers in Angola who have not been vaccinated to do so, for their own health while in Angola and to eliminate the risk of dissemination of the virus when they leave, should they be viremic on departure.China says it will vaccinate all its expat workers going to Angola. Since China has thousands of workers deployed worldwide, now is the time for at-risk countries receiving Chinese workers to check even before their arrival that they are not coming direct from Angola, Ghana, Mali or any other country in the YF endemic zones with a recent YF outbreak. China is producing its own YF vaccine. All Chinese now working in Angola should be vaccinated as soon as possible.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mods.TY/JW][See Also:Yellow fever - Africa (27): Angola 20160323.4114429Yellow fever - Africa (26): Congo DR 20160320.4107262Yellow fever - Africa (25): Angola comment 20160319.4106114Yellow fever - Africa (24): Kenya ex Angola 20160318.4104819Yellow fever - China (04) ex Angola 20160322.4109684Yellow fever - China (03): ex Angola 20160319.4106312Yellow fever - China (02): ex Angola 20160318.4105105Yellow fever - China: ex Angola, 1st case in Asia 20160313.4089857Yellow fever - Africa (23): Angola (HL) 20160317.4102488Yellow fever - Africa (21): Angola 20160315.4095607Yellow fever - Africa (18): Angola 20160313.4090378Yellow fever - Africa (17): Angola 20160310.4084268Yellow fever - Africa (16): Angola 20160227.4053826Yellow fever - Africa (15): Angola, fake vaccine, SE Asia, WHO alert 20160224.4047041Yellow fever - Africa (14): Angola 20160223.4044335Yellow fever - Africa (13): Angola (HL) 20160219.4033812Yellow fever - Africa (12): Angola 20160213.4019319Yellow fever - Africa (11): Angola 20160211.4012749Yellow fever - Africa (10): Angola (HM) 20160210.4010453Yellow fever - Africa (09): Angola 20160208.4003005Yellow fever - Africa (08): Angola RFI 20160204.3995342Yellow fever - Africa (07): Angola (LU) RFI 20160201.3984228Yellow fever - Africa (05): Angola (HL) 20160129.3977685Yellow fever - Africa (04): Angola (LU) conf, RFI 20160127.3965357Yellow fever - Africa (03): Angola (LU) comment, RFI 20160123.3959897Yellow fever - Africa (02): Angola (LU) RFI 20160122.3958601].................................................jw/ty/ao/mj/jw/je/sh"
