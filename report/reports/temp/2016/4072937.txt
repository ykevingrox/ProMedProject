Club Industry [edited]<http://clubindustry.com/24-hour-fitness/report-former-member-alleges-disease-24-hour-fitness-california>A 24 Hour Fitness club in Southern California is the site of an alleged outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease.The scope of the alleged outbreak at the 24 Hour Fitness on Via Princessa in Santa Clarita is unknown. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said there has been ""no word of this [disease] occurring"" at any fitness club or any other facility in the area, according to a Santa Clarita Valley Signal report published on Tue [1 Mar 2015]. That story noted that state law does not require hand, foot, and mouth disease to be reported.One of the club's former members claimed that 5 children and one parent were affected by the virus, according to a KTLA report that was broadcast on Mon [29 Feb 2016]. Richards claimed that 2 of the club's employees told her of the virus' contraction, and one employee was uncomfortable with how the situation was handled by management.One former member learned about alleged unsanitary conditions from an employee in the Kid's Club child care area and was later told by management that a ""deep cleaning"" was done, according to a KHTS report published on Mon [29 Feb 2016], citing an anonymous source. 24 Hour Fitness did not respond to the allegations raised in the KHTS report in a statement the company provided to Club Industry for this story.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Santa Clarita, where this outbreak is reputed to have occurred, is located in southern California, USA. As stated in an earlier post on this enterovirus (ProMED-mail post ""Hand, foot & mouth disease - Canada: ex Mexico (QR) resort 20160229.4057670""), hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] is spread by coming into contact with secretions (fluids) from the nose and throat, saliva, or fluid from blisters or stool (feces) of an infected person. It is spread through close personal contact, coughing, sneezing or from touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. This would place fitness clubs and other facilities where equipment or toys are shared at high risk. Thorough cleaning and disinfection of equipment are critical to the control of spread of this virus.HFMD is not a reportable disease, and consequently the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has not received notification of these cases. 24 Hour Fitness has stated that they conducted a thorough cleaning of the Kid's Club Area, hopefully eliminating infectious virus. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
