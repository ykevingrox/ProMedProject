Herald Online<http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article54489490.html>2 people in York County were exposed to rabies last week from a horse that was thought to be lame but turned out to be rabid, health officials said.The people were providing care to the horse Thursday when the horse started to exhibit aggressive behavior. The horse was killed and tested and Monday found to have had rabies. Both people were told to seek medical treatment for possible rabies exposure, state health officials said in a release Wednesday.Horses are not required to have rabies shots. However, state officials encourage rabies vaccinations for any animals that have frequent contact with people. State officials urge people to notice sudden changes in domestic animal behavior and avoid contact with wild animals.The horse is the 1st York County animal to test positive for rabies in 2016 and the 2nd animal statewide. 9 animals tested positive in York County in 2015 out of 130 confirmed rabies cases in the state.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[For a map showing the counties in South Carolina, see <http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/south-carolina.shtml>.

""This unusual behavior can be caused by several different illnesses, with rabies being a possibility.""All 4 foxes were found in a similar area, and while there has been no evidence of the sickness spreading, Juarez said his agency takes the rabies threat very seriously.""The real concern for rabies is if a human contracts it, it has such a high mortality rate,"" Juarez. No human contacts or bites associated with the fox sightings have been reported.WCHD officials think the virus may have the potential to spread, at least within the fox population, because foxes live together in dens. When species cohabitate, the disease can spread faster than it might in singular, roaming animals.The Department of Health reported raccoons, bats, foxes and stray cats are most commonly diagnosed with the disease. While the virus is not often spread to humans, it is possible through bites or contact with an infected animal's saliva or mucus.People tend to think of a rabies-positive animal as appearing outwardly rabid, but Juarez said that not usually the case. ""People think of the foaming mouth, and that is semi-accurate,"" Juarez said. ""But they will sometimes act very dumb and will be very docile. What happens is, domestic animals and humans will approach them.""The rabies virus affects the animal's nervous system, suppressing its instincts, leading to unusual behavior.""You know the natural curiosity kids have. If there's a cute fox out in the yard acting friendly, they may approach it,"" Juarez said. ""If an animal is not reacting the way they would any other day, beware.""WCHD suggested several precautions residents can take to avoid coming in contact with infected animals:- Keep rabies vaccinations up to date for all pets.- Keep your pets under direct supervision so they do not come in contact with wild animals. If your pet is bitten by a wild animal, seek veterinary assistance for the animal immediately and contact Wakulla Animal Services at 850-926-0902.- Call Wakulla Animal Services to remove any stray domestic animals from your neighborhood. - For suspicious wild animals, contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at 850-245-7710.- Spay or neuter your pets to help reduce the number of unwanted pets that may not be properly cared for or regularly vaccinated.- Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or litter. - Do not leave your pet's food outside.  This will attract strays and wildlife.- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home.- Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly.- Prevent bats from entering living quarters or occupied spaces in homes, churches, schools, and other similar areas, where they might come in contact with people and pets--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <ProMED@promedmail.org>[For a map of Florida with counties, see <http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/florida.shtml>.

State officials are now warning, however, that kittens in the same litter may have also been exposed to rabies and may become contagious if they develop the disease.A 2nd kitten, which was found at the same time and place as the kitten who tested positive for the disease, has been located and is being isolated for observation.If there were other kittens in the litter they may have been exposed to the rabies virus and will need to be examined by a veterinarian and isolated to ensure they do not have rabies, state officials said.Officials are urging anyone with information about kittens that may have been part of the litter to contact the North Dakota Department of Health's Division of Disease Control at (800) 472-2180, or (701) 328-2378.Rabies is a viral infection that affects mammals, including humans, and can be transmitted through saliva. It causes swelling of the brain and is often fatal.[Byline: Dave Olson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[For a map of North Dakota showing counties, see <http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/north-dakota.shtml>.

""When they come into contact with strays or unvaccinated pets, they can pass the infection.""Tanner said the best protection against rabies is to vaccinate pets.""People interested in adopting animals should go through reputable organizations or individuals and should ask for vaccination records,"" he added, noting that district environmental health specialists have had to investigate rabies exposures related to pets acquired through online services.Tanner also offered another recommendation to avoid rabies exposure: ""Please avoid interacting with wild animals or strays, especially if they are showing odd behavior - such as being out during daytime or acting aggressively.""Anyone bitten by wild animals or strays should seek immediate medical attention and contact the Mitchell County Health Department and law enforcement, he said. ""You should not attempt to catch the animal yourself. The authorities will handle that so that it can be tested for rabies.""Rabies is fatal in humans if untreated, but almost 100 percent preventable in humans when prompt action is taken, Dixon said.Georgia law requires dogs and cats 3 months old and older to be vaccinated against rabies. Pet ferrets should also receive rabies inoculations, as should valuable livestock, Tanner said.For more information about rabies, contact the Mitchell County Health Department at 229-366-2055 or go online to <www.southwestgeorgiapublichealth.org.>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[For a map of Georgia showing counties, see <http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/georgia.shtml>.

But in none of these articles is it recognized that a rabies drive might be important to connect with the community, more than just an article in the newspaper or on the local radio. Keeping pets vaccinated and teaching children and compassionate people about the dangers of rabies is critical.One article provided information about both furious (the typical aggressive, foaming at the mouth) and the dumb (shy, withdrawn, abnormal behavior) forms of rabies. It is important to know both forms of the disease and understand the general reaction of the animals. - Mod.TG]
