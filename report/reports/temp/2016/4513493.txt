South Wales Evening Post [edited]<http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/measles-outbreak-reported-in-carmarthenshire/story-29745346-detail/story.html>Public health officials have reported an outbreak of measles in Carmarthenshire with 9 cases so far confirmed this month [September 2016].All of the cases have been linked to summer festivals, prompting a warning to parents and young adults about the importance of getting the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] jab.Public Health Wales say 6 of the cases are thought to be directly linked to patients who contracted the virus while at the Green Gathering environmental festival in Chepstow last month [August 2016].The outbreak follows cases reported in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Powys.Dr Brendan Mason, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control for Public Health Wales, said: ""After not seeing cases of measles in Wales for some time, we're concerned that we now have an outbreak, which includes seeing the disease being passed on beyond household settings.""It is important that those that have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine get vaccinated so that they are protected from this preventable disease. People who are not vaccinated not only risk catching measles themselves, but could also pass it to babies too young to have received MMR and who are at risk of serious complications.""Measles is very contagious and can easily be passed between strangers in the community. It is possible that a very small number of recent cases may have contracted the infection in the public waiting area at Glangwili Hospital A&E. This has led to warnings that anyone who suspects they have measles should phone their GP for advice before attending hospital.""Anyone who has a rash that could be measles is urged not to attend any public place where unvaccinated people could be present, but to seek advice from their GP or NHS [National Health Service] Direct Wales.""Health bosses say crowds of people provide the perfect environment for infectious diseases like measles to circulate, but 2 doses of the safe and effective MMR vaccine can offer protection.Hywel Dda University Health Board's Director of Public Health, Teresa Owen, added: ""We want to assure the public that we are being vigilant and taking all appropriate infection control measures in respect of this outbreak.""We urge our community and staff to also be vigilant and to ensure they and their family members are up-to-date on MMR vaccinations and are aware of the symptoms to look out for.""[Byline: David Higgs]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
