The case was in my hospital [SÌ£o JosÌ© do Rio Preto Base Hospital, SÌ£o Paulo (SP) state]. It was a classical YF [yellow fever] presentation. The diagnostic was done by serology and RT-PCR in the liver of the patient (in autopsy material). The diagnosis was made almost 14 days ago, not this week (as in the post). The diagnosis was made by Instituto Adolfo Lutz.2. The patient came to the city a few months before. He did not get YF vaccination.3. He went to Mata dos Macacos [SÌ£o JosÌ© do Rio Preto municipality] several times. THIS IS NOT a remote area. In fact is less than 10 miles [16 km] from downtown SÌ£o JosÌ© do Rio Preto, which has 500 000 habitants.4. The Mata dos Macacos (or ""monkey forest"") is known by the large presence of NHP [non-human primates] (this is why it has this name).5. YF circulation is know in this region of SP State for centuries. In fact YF vaccination is part of the regular schedule. It was a major mistake to live in this region without YF vaccination.6. The last human case of YF in the region was in 2001 and not 2008. In 2008 we had NHP YF detection.--MaurÌ cio Lacerda Nogueira, MD, PhDLaboratÌ rio de Pesquisas em VirologiaDepartamento de DoenÌ¤as DermatolÌ gicas, Infecciosas e ParasitÌÁriasFaculdade de Medicina de SÌ£o JosÌ© do Rio Preto - FAMERPBrazil<mnogueira@famerp.br>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr MaurÌ cio Lacerda Nogueira for correcting several errors in the previous post concerning this yellow fever case. His report indicates that the YF diagnosis was made promptly and competently. He makes a very important point -- individuals who venture into areas where there is sylvan YF circulation should be vaccinated at least 10 days beforehand.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1887>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Yellow fever - Americas (05): Brazil (SP) 20160507.4208015Yellow fever - Americas (02): Brazil (MG) monkeys, susp, RFI 20160409.4148624Yellow fever - Americas: Brazil (RN) RFI 20160118.39464662015----Yellow fever - Americas (14): Brazil (RN) susp, RFI 20151230.3902261Yellow fever - Americas (10): Brazil (TO), monkeys 20150801.3551886Yellow fever - Americas (08): Brazil (GO) new confirmed case 20150605.3412520Yellow fever - Americas (06): Brazil (PR,MS) RFI 20150507.3346684Yellow fever - Americas (03): Brazil (AP) 20150330.3264348Yellow fever - Americas (02): Brazil (GO) 20150217.3171008Yellow fever - Americas: Brazil (GO), RFI 20150214.31670192014----Yellow fever - Americas (04): Brazil (TO) 20140718.26189932012----Yellow fever - South America (06): Brazil (SP) monkeys, susp. 20120831.1275481Yellow fever - South America (04): Brazil (RS) 20120611.1164326Yellow fever - South America (03): Brazil, Peru 20120308.10649572011----Yellow fever - South America (02): Brazil (MG), monkeys 20111125.34532009----Yellow fever - South America (26): Brazil (PA), monkeys, susp. 20090414.1424Yellow fever - South America (25): Brazil (SP) 20090408.1358].................................................lm/ty/mj/dk"
