Today Online [edited]<http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/residents-worried-about-spread-tb-family-members>Some residents [Today Online] spoke to were shocked by the news of a cluster of 6 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) cases emerging at their block in Ang Mo Kio, expressing fear that their children or elderly family members could be vulnerable.When [Today Online] went down to Block 203 on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, MOH [Ministry of Health] officials were going door to door with members of Ang Mo Kio Town Council, handing out advisories on the situation to the residents. The advisories informed residents of the cases, and that free TB screening would be available for all residents of the block from today. It also explained to residents how TB was spread -- with prolonged and close contact -- and what the screening would entail (a chest X-ray and a blood test).Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio, GRC Koh Poh Koon, was also spotted visiting some flats and speaking to residents, but he declined to speak to the media.[A resident] said she was surprised by the number of cases, which was not specified on the advisories. Another resident said that she was worried that her 3 children could be more vulnerable to the disease. Added the 43-year-old salesperson: ""The Government should be putting in more effort to inform us responsibly what is going on."" But a resident of 16 years, said that he was not worried as long as precautions are taken. ""The Government does care for us and we should just follow the precautionary steps that they suggest,"" he said.[Byline: Iliyas Juanda]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a form of tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the 2 most potent 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is a subset of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to fluoroquinolones and at least one of the three 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).MDR TB may be primary or secondary. Secondary MDR TB is acquired as a consequence of the emergence of drug-resistant mutants during inadequate or improper use of anti-TB medications for active TB. Primary MDR TB is a new infection (in the absence of a history of prior treatment with anti-TB drugs) that has been acquired from someone with MDR TB. Primary drug resistance indicates need for better TB control to interrupt transmission, whereas secondary drug resistance indicates need for better patient management to prevent the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.Transmission of tuberculosis depends on the contagiousness of the patient (that is, the concentration and size of infectious particles the patient expels into the air), the proximity to the patient, ventilation of the space in which exposure takes place, and duration of exposure. Usually, contagious patients have cavitary tuberculosis and are coughing or sneezing, which generates a large quantity of aerosols that contain tubercle bacilli. This degree of contagiousness is indicated by a positive smear of sputum stained specifically for mycobacteria, that is, a smear stained for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Transmission usually requires close, repeated or prolonged contact with a contagious individual in a poorly ventilated environment.The news report above does not say whether any of the 6 patients with MDR TB share anything in common, other than living in the same neighborhood (Ang Mo Kio) in Singapore. Genotyping the isolates would help confirm a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. ProMED-mail would appreciate information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.Ang Mo Kio, abbreviated AMK, is a residential town situated in the North-East Region of Singapore; Ang Mo Kio is the 8th most populated planning area in the country overall (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio>). Planning Areas are the main urban planning and census divisions of Singapore; there are a total of 55 of these areas, organized into 5 regions (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore>). A map of Singapore showing the planning areas and regions can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore#/media/File:Singapore_MP2008._Urban_Planning_Areas.svg> (Ang Mo Kio is number 27). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3609>.]
