South China Morning Post [edited]<http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/1966921/doctors-warn-botox-risks-fourth-hong-kong-woman>Doctors warned of botox-related side effects after 4 cases of botulism, all involving local women getting injections in mainland China, were reported in the space of a week. The women, aged between 21 and 47, developed potentially fatal complications such as difficulty in swallowing and breathing, and were admitted to hospitals for further treatment. The Medical Association advised the public to understand the functions and potential risks of botox injections before getting them, and to have the procedures performed by qualified doctors in Hong Kong.Compared to 2015, private dermatologists this year have noticed a 20 to 30 per cent rise in the number of patients who required follow-up treatment at local clinics after receiving beauty treatments on the mainland.""All information available now only highlights the benefits without mentioning the risks,"" Dr Kingsley Chan Hau-ngai, a private dermatologist and council member of the Medical Association, said. Apart from patients suffering less severe side effects such as headaches and bruising, Chan has treated a 47 year old woman who could not open her right eye after having botox done elsewhere. ""The dosage used might be too high ... and the injection site might not be accurate enough,"" Chan said, adding that it could take up to 6 months for the symptoms to disappear, after effects from the botox dispersed. Each month, his clinic treats 2 to 3 cases which need follow-up after beauty treatments, including botox injection, on the mainland. Of those with botulism -- a serious possible side effect from the injection -- 5 to 10 per cent of them could die, according to WHO.While aesthetic doctors said on Sat [4 Jun 2016] that such complications would take around 6 times the normal dosage, Chan said receiving injections on the entire body at once would lead to potential risks, as the diluted level of the toxin was not the same for different body parts. There could be an issue if the same tube was used for the entire body, he said, adding that various brands had their own methods of dilution even for the same body part.Dr Chow Pak-chin, the association's vice-president, advised the public to receive high-risk beauty treatments in the city. ""Doctors are trained and are under strict regulation by the Medical Council,"" said Chow.[byline: Elizabeth Cheung]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2]Date: Mon 6 Jun 2016Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]Updated news coverage from a Hong Kong local channel ""Now News"" was released on 6 Jun 2016. A Hong Kong journalist went to a Shenzhen mall in Dongmen with more than 10 beauty premises. The journalist visited one of them. A person who claimed himself/herself as a doctor suggested that imported Botox would cost 4000 RMB [renminbi; about 609 USD], but Chinese made Botox would cost only 800 RMB [about 122 USD]. This mall in Dongmen, Shenzhen is about 3km [about 2mi] or 30 minutes walk away from the mall (Luohu) where the 41 year old patient was visited, and is also a popular location of Hong Kong people for shopping. Luohu is located at the border between Hong Kong and mainland China.The journalist further called the Chinese supplier of Botox [the cheapest one]; they claimed that more than 90 per cent of the Botox for sales in the market are counterfeits and cost 180 RMB [about 27 USD] only.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*****[3]Date: Sun 5 Jun 2016Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The use of Botox can be unregulated. Administration could even be done by beauticians with no healthcare training in Hong Kong. Some advertise it at salons to clients -- I was offered while doing my manicure -- where no medical doctors are present or employed. Prices can range as low as HKD 388 (USD 50) compared to a qualified dermatologist/cosmetic surgeon. The supply is dubious at the pricing, since a legitimate doctor charges well over 3000 HKD per session, not inclusive of initial consultation charges.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases has doubled from 2 to 4. Although the source of the botulinum toxin used is unknown, it is likely that the product is not properly standardized to dose. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.]
