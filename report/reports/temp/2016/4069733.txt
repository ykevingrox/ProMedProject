Since December [2015], 5 cases of the life-threatening illness have been reported among young women in Kent, Mason, Montcalm and Oakland counties, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [MDHHS]. None of the cases were fatal. An average of fewer than 4 cases were reported annually over the last 10 years, according to MDHHS.4 out of 5 young women in this latest case spike used superabsorbent tampons. The Playtex Sport brand was used by 4 of them, and the 5th girl used U by Kotex.""Although [TSS] cases are rare, this recent cluster is an important reminder to always review product safety information,"" Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive with the MDHHS, said in a release. The Food and Drug Administration was notified regarding product information. TSS is a rare illness caused by a bacterial infection that affects organs. It can be caused by tampon usage or exposure to bacteria through a surgical wound, open wound or a burn. TSS progresses quickly with symptoms that can feel like the flu, including: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle aches, low blood pressure, rash, and shock with multi-organ dysfunction.The illness is commonly associated with the improper use of high-absorbency tampons. Women are advised not to leave a tampon in longer than 6 to 8 hours. The risk of TSS is higher with higher absorbency tampons. MDHHS employees are collaborating with local health departments to monitor cases, provide clinical guidance and coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health care providers received a Michigan Health Alert Network notification encouraging enhanced surveillance, as well as collection of clinical specimens and product history during patient evaluations.[Byline: Angie Jackson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) presents as an acute potentially fatal non-specific illness with fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema of mucous membranes, and a scarlet-fever like rash (<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome-other-than-streptococcal/case-definition/2011/>). The rash ultimately desquamates, typically on the palms and soles, 1-2 weeks after onset of the rash. The clinical presentation may progress rapidly with development of deterioration in mental status, low blood platelet count, respiratory distress, renal failure, shock and death. TSS is due to an infection caused by a toxin-producing _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (also known as Group A streptococcus or GAS). Staphylococcal TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1) is the toxin responsible for most cases of TSS. In 1980, an outbreak of TSS was found to be occurring in menstruating women, primarily associated with use of a new brand of superabsorbent tampon that was made of materials not previously used in tampons (a polyester foam infused with carboxymethylcellulose) (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3238331/>). There was no evidence to suggest that changes in _S. aureus_ were responsible for the emergence of menstrual-related TSS (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00047818.htm>). The manufacturer pulled this superabsorbent tampon most frequently associated with TSS off the market in 1980 and other manufacturers subsequently lowered the absorbency of their tampons. By 1986, very high absorbency tampons were used by only 1 percent of women who used tampons (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001651.htm>). Tampons containing polyacrylate (an absorbent gel) were withdrawn from the market in 1985, resulting in a further reduction in menstrual-related TSS (<https://books.google.com/books?id=BOsDwhZhDy0C&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=Polyacrylate-containing+tampons&source>). Manufacturers were also required to warn women of the hazards of using high absorbency tampons, exclusive use of tampons, or leaving a tampon in place for an extended period of time. Current tampons are manufactured from cotton and/or rayon. However, in vitro studies have found that cotton tampons neither prevent TSST-1 production nor significantly adsorb toxin onto the fibers to make toxin unavailable to cause toxic shock syndrome (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=7561191&dopt=Abstract>). After TSS became a nationally notifiable disease in 1980, the incidence of menstrual-related toxic shock syndrome was found to have declined from 812 in 1980 to just 5 in 1997 (<http://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/blog/1980-the-worst-year-in-tampon-history/>; <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/6/99-0611-f1>).Most cases are now non-menstrual and are related to skin infections, surgical or burn wound infections, postpartum or postabortion infections, and use of barrier contraceptives (sponges and diaphragms). However, menstrual TSS cases continue to occur and affect women 13 to 19 years old, an age group not as likely to be aware of the risk for TSS (<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/6/99-0611_article>). Ages of the 5 affected women were not given in the news report above, but they were said to be ""young"". Although the tampon brands mentioned in the news report above were said to be available in a range of absorbencies, 4 of 5 of the TSS cases were reported to have used higher absorbency tampons. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.].................................................sb/ml/je/dk"
