This was announced by the Health SEREMI [regional ministerial administrative unit], Maria Graciela Astudillo, who said that the patient is a 28-year-old man who remains in critical condition due to respiratory failure in the intensive care unit of the Indisa Clinic in Santiago.The health authority said that the ISP has registered 17 cases in the region since 1995, with the latest figure in the month of March this year [2016], which was a 22-year-old [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160326.4120952].With respect to this new case, the health authority indicated that they are working on the epidemiological investigation to determine the origin of the infections.It is presumed that the affected individual, who lives in the San Vicente community in the O'Higgins region, had contracted the virus infection while he was carrying out chores for a subcontracted company in a rural area of the Nogales community, which has risk factors due to a large amount of vegetation and wildlife.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Details of the conditions under which this young man acquired his hantavirus infection are not given, but there will be an epidemiological investigation of the area where he worked. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>. - Mod.TY]
