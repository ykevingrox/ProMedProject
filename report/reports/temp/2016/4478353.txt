No eschar and/or rash was seen. Dengue, chikungunya, brucellosis and leptospirosis were tested negative. But he tested positive for scrub typhus using ELISA method. He has been complaining of hearing problem during his OPD follow up (on 8 Sep [2016]).To my knowledge, this is the 1st reported case of hearing impairment associated with scrub typhus in Nepal. Hearing impairment is considered as a rare complication following infection with scrub typhus, though few cases have been reported in the literature.--Communicated by:Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research UnitSukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease HospitalKathmandu, Nepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions.Maps of Nepal can be seen at <http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm> (regions and districts) and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18543>.
