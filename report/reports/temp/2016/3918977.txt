CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/01/news-scan-jan-05-2016>Study shows minor flu strains readily transmissible---------------------------------------------------Minor variants of influenza strains, which are not specifically targeted in vaccines, were found along with major strains during the 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong and were readily transmitted among households and may cause a greater impact than previously realized, according to a small study yesterday [4 Jan 2016] in Nature Genetics.""A flu virus infection is not a homogeneous mix of viruses, but, rather, a mix of strains that gets transmitted as a swarm in the population,"" said Elodie Ghedin, PhD, of New York University [NYU] in an NYU press release. ""Current vaccines target the dominant strains, because they are the ones that seem to infect the largest number of individuals. But our findings reveal an ability of minor strains to elude these vaccines and spread the virus in ways not previously known.""A team of Hong Kong and US researchers performed whole-genome deep sequencing of upper nasal cavity swabs taken from 67 confirmed 2009 Hong Kong flu patients and 17 of their household contacts. Using sophisticated methods, the scientists not only identified variants in flu strains, but also quantified what strains were being transmitted.Their results showed that, as expected, most carried the dominant viruses 2009 H1N1 or H3N2. In addition, though, all carried minor strains and variants of both major and minor strains, as well. The variants were readily transmitted among the volunteers studied.""We were able to look at the variants and could link individuals based on these variants,"" said Ghedin in the NYU release. ""What stood out was also how these mixes of major and minor strains were being transmitted across the population during the 2009 pandemic -- to the point where minor strains became dominant.""LLM Poon, T Song, R Rosenfeld. Quantifying influenza virus diversity and transmission in humans. Nat Genet Letter. Nature Genetics (2016) doi:10.1038/ng.3479 <http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3479.html>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[RNA viruses, because of their high replication rates and error prone RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), exist as swarms of viral mutants. Selection is on the swarm and not individual strains within the swarm. It has become increasingly apparent with RNA viruses that more attention needs to be paid to the viral swarm and not only the consensus sequence. This interesting letter reported above suggests there is a weak bottleneck during transmission from human to human allowing variants to be transmitted along with the dominant genotype. This is important as vaccines or possibly immune responses may allow the minor variants to escape detection and become dominant. It also allows recombination to occur between variants infecting the same cell. Further research on the role of variants in the population is merited. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.]
