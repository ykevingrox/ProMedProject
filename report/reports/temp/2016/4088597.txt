So if you've not received 2 doses of the vaccine in the past -- or you're unsure -- speak to your GP.""There's no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty.""Measles -- which can cause cold-like symptoms, high temperatures and red-brown blotchy rashes -- has been at a historic low in the UK due to immunisation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] UK: measles, fall in vaccination coverageDate: Sat 12 May 2016Source: Daily Mail [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12258/UK-faces-measles-epidemic.html>Experts are warning that Britain faces a measles epidemic because parents are failing to have their children immunised after health scares about the vaccine MMR.Government scientists fear that an outbreak could hit children who return to school this week and are renewing pleas to ensure children are given the 3-in-1 measles, mumps and rubella jab.The MMR vaccine has been around for over a decade, but concerns about side effects have dented confidence in the vaccination and reduced the take up to a dangerous level.Scares have linked the vaccine to autism, bowel disorders, deafness, Crohn's disease, arthritis and epilepsy.Over the last 5 years the number of children being immunised has fallen from 92 per cent to 87 per cent.A similar fall in the numbers of children being vaccinated led to an outbreak of measles in Ireland last year [2015].At least 95 per cent of children must be protected to keep the disease at bay, said Dr Mike Catchpole, director of the Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre at the Public Heath Laboratory in London.He warned: 'We are now below the critical threshold at which point we run the risk of getting a large number of cases.'However, almost 2000 families have taken legal action claiming their children have been damaged by the MMR jab. About half believe it has triggered autism in their toddlers even though the Government has ruled out any link after clinical studies.Last year the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry [ABPI] warned that parents' refusal to get children vaccinated could lead to an epidemic.Dr Trevor Jones, director-general of the ABPI, said: 'The development of modern vaccines has been one of the greatest successes of medical science, with many diseases effectively eradicated in Britain. It is vital that we do not squander the position we have reached.'Shadow health secretary, Dr Liam Fox, also expressed his concern about the drop in the numbers of children being vaccinated with MMR.He said: 'There is a real need to redouble our efforts to improve measles immunisation. It is therefore vital that we apply the conclusions drawn from the meningitis campaign to boost our MMR programme before unnecessary tragedies occur.'The Department of Health is recommending that all parents go directly to their GPs [general practitioners] and have their children vaccinated in order to prevent a measles outbreak.A spokesman said: 'Every time there's a health scare, parents withdraw their children from vaccination. But there is no evidence to show that the MMR jab is linked to autism and bowel disorders.'One study published in 1995 suggested there was a link, but there is no other evidence to prove this. Each time there is a vaccine drop it increases the risk of a measles outbreak and even an epidemic.'The MMR jab is recommended by the World Health Organisation for children all around the world, and is the most effective and safe vaccination to protect children against measles.'[Byline: Andrea Perry] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Measles is caused by the measles virus (a paramyxovirus). It is a highly contagious viral disease that can be fatal. Among unimmunized people exposed to the virus, over 90% will contract the disease. In most people, the disease produces fever (temperature > 101 F [38.3 C]), a generalized rash that lasts greater than 3 days, cough, runny nose (coryza), and red eyes (conjunctivitis). The complications of measles that result in most deaths include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). The infected person is highly contagious for 4 days before the rash appears until 4 days after the rash appears. The virus can remain in the air (and still be able to cause disease) for up to 2 hours after an infected person has left a room.A vaccine was 1st developed in 1963 to prevent measles. Before the vaccine was made available, almost every child became infected with the virus because it is so easily spread. Before routine vaccination, there were approximately 3-4 million cases of measles and 500 deaths due to measles each year in the United States.The current vaccine is a live attenuated virus vaccine. It has been modified a number of times to make it safer (further attenuated) and today is extremely effective in preventing the disease. With increasing numbers of people who refuse vaccination, there are likely going to be more complications and deaths from measles in the future. The people most likely to have complications (including death) are those who are malnourished or who have weakened immune systems.
