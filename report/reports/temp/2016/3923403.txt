El Litoral [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/124736-una-mujer-murio-de-hantavirus-en-el-sur-de-la-provincia>A 54-year-old woman died due to a hantavirus clinical illness in a hospital in Casilda, 50 km [8 mi] south of the Santa Fe city of Rosario, where she was hospitalized for 2 weeks.  This information was issued by sources from the Santa Fe Ministry of Health, who stated that the death occurred in the San Carlos provincial hospital. The woman, a resident of the Pujato locality, on presenting with respiratory difficulties, had been sent 2 weeks ago to this health center, where she was placed in the intensive therapy ward when the infection was diagnosed.  The victim worked as a domestic employee in a geriatric facility in Casilda, 15 km [8 mi] from from her home, located along national route 33.  It is believed that she contracted a hantavirus infection in this area, where rodents circulate searching for [spilled] grain on the roadway. This affliction ia an acute, infectious disease [caused by a virus] that is transmitted from hantavirus-infected rodents that eliminate it in feces, urine and saliva.   Infection is acquired by contact with environment that is contaminated by virus, which enters the body through the mouth, nose, eyes or though wounds in the skin. The main symptoms are fever and chills, muscle pain, headache, nausea and vomiting as well as occasional abdominal pain and diarrhea [and in severe cases, cardiopulmonary complications that can lead to death, as in this case]. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Without differential laboratory tests, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this or in any of the previous cases. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 4 years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this  cases in Sant Fe province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.The public in these endemic areas needs to be informed about the need to keep their houses and out-buildings free of rodents, and to avoid places were they might come in contact with rodents and their feces, urine, or saliva. There is little that the health officials could do, other than inform the public of the measures needed to prevent exposure to the virus.An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at <http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg>.Maps of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.argentina.org.au/images/mapa-politico-argentina.jpg> and <ttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/21242>. - Mod.TY]
