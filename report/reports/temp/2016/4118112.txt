Brisbane Times [edited]<http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/herberton-hospital-struck-by-another-outbreak-20160323-gnq1lv.html>Staff and patients at a far north Queensland hospital are showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, less than 2 months after an outbreak that coincided with the deaths of 7 elderly people. The Herberton Hospital, near Cairns, has stopped taking new admissions pending test results from 3 staff and 3 patients.The aged-care facility was investigated by the state's chief health officer after 7 patients died amid an outbreak of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) earlier in the year [2016]. Only one of the patients who died tested positive for the virus, and 4 others showed symptoms.Authorities say the 2 incidents are not thought to be related, and staff have acted quickly to reduce the risk of further cases. ""There has been a lot of respiratory infection in the community this year [2016],"" infectious diseases physician Trent Yarwood said. ""There is no additional risk to members of the public."" Communal activities at the 38-bed facility have also been temporarily stopped pending results. Dr Yarwood says people should wash their hands and stay away from work if they're unwell to stop the spread of infections.Authorities were last week cleared of any wrongdoing in their response to the 1st outbreak at the hospital. Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young noted the facility, which is only air-conditioned in communal areas, is more than 30 years old but well-maintained and clean for its age. She also said staff at the hospital had shown a commitment to quality care. All 7 deaths have been reported to the coroner.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The pathogenesis of HMPV infections in adults seems to be similar to that in children. HMPV is associated with severe infection in patients with pulmonary disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564111/pdf/viruses-05-00087.pdf>]. Various studies have shown that incidence of HMPV cases in adults ranged from 4.3-13.2 per cent over consecutive winter seasons in hospitalized adults over 50 years of age. However, when compared to RSV and influenza, similar rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and length of hospitalization have been reported for HMPV infection in adults [<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564111/pdf/viruses-05-00087.pdf>].It seems that the 2 outbreaks are not related, but there may be a common source of introduction of infection. Also, there are many factors unknown about the pathogen itself. Is there an asymptomatic carrier state? What about the test results for other respiratory viruses or bacteria or others? - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285>.]
