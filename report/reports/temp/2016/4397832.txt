Independent.ie [edited]<http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/hse-warn-of-significant-increase-in-syphilis-reports-in-cork-34940656.html>There has been a 'significant increase' in the numbers of syphilis reports in Cork, according to a statement released by the HSE [Health Services Executive]. There have been 21 reported cases in Cork and Kerry from January to June this year [2016]. This is 3 times more than the same period from 2015.Gay men are the highest risk group, with 8 out of every 10 cases reported being from men who have sex with men [MSM].The HSE Department of Public Health in Cork has released a statement expressing concerns and is encouraging anyone who is sexually active to get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Department of Public Health said. ""Safer sex practices and regular testing and treatment of infectious syphilis are the key to prevention. ""Syphilis has been called the 'Great Pretender' as its symptoms can look like many other diseases. Up to half of people with syphilis may not notice any symptoms; therefore it is vital to get tested.""Professor Mary Horgan, Consultant in Infectious Diseases at CUH and clinical lead for STI services in Cork and Kerry, confirmed that cases are increasing in the area. She said: ""I have seen a significant increase in syphilis among [MSM]. I would encourage (gay men) who have had unprotected sex, including unprotected oral sex, to book an STI test as soon as possible. While 90 percent of the cases we are seeing are primary syphilis, up to half of people with syphilis may not have any symptoms, and therefore could pass it on unintentionally. Syphilis is curable with treatment. Unrecognised, untreated syphilis can lead to serious long-term complications.""[Byline: Cian Murray]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Ireland can be seen at <http://www.vidiani.com/maps/maps_of_europe/maps_of_ireland/administrative_map_of_ireland.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29188>.County Cork is the largest, second most populous (with a population of 542 196); and most southern county in Ireland (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork>). County Kerry is northwest of County Cork and has a population of 147 554.For a discussion of syphilis, see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below.There is an on-going worldwide epidemic of the primary and secondary syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM). If some of the increasing numbers of MSM also have unprotected sex with wives and girlfriends, there may be a spillover that may lead to a rising incidence of syphilis in women and congenital syphilis. - Mod.ML]
