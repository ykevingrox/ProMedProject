According to the Institute, the highest number of deaths from this cause have been in BogotÌÁ (95) and the departments of Antioquia (51), La Guajira (38), ChocÌ  (36) and Cundinamarca (25).For its part, the Ministry of Health has reported that 17 territorial entities reported death rates higher than the national average for acute respiratory infection (IRA). The director of epidemiology and demography of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, Sandra GirÌ n, said that these deaths are 11.5 per cent higher than in the previous year [2015].Entities like Tolima, Meta, Putumayo, Vichada, GuainÌ a and VaupÌ©s show a significant rise, contributing 12.7 per cent of the total number of reported cases (58). 123 deaths have been reported in the indigenous population, and that corresponds to 26.3 per cent of the national report, she said.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[""Acute respiratory infection"" is a rather nonspecific term, which could be taken to include common and usually self-limiting viral upper respiratory tract infections, like colds, and more invasive lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia that may interfere with normal breathing. The report above, while not providing any baseline mortality data, suggests that the ""acute respiratory infection"" being reported is causing considerable morbidity and mortality.Acute respiratory infections, by implication, can spread from one person to another. Children are especially at risk because of their constant contact with other kids who could be virus carriers. Children often don't wash their hands regularly. They rub their eyes and put their fingers in their mouths, resulting in the spread of viruses. They are born immunologically naive, and vulnerable to whatever infection comes along, and their first five years tend to be marked by a succession of acute respiratory infections. Fortunately, they usually survive, and emerge with their immune systems primed.Some possible infectious agents include adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, pneumococcus, mycoplasma, and haemophilus.
