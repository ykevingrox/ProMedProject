Arias A, Watson SJ, Asogun et al. (19 May 2016). Rapid outbreak sequencing of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone identifies transmission chains linked to sporadic cases. _ VirusEvolution_ <http://ve.oxfordjournals.org/sites/default/files/Outbreak_sequencing_of_Ebola_virus.pdf>Abstract.To end the largest known outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa and to prevent new transmissions, rapid epidemiological tracing of cases and contacts was required. The ability to quickly identify unknown sources and chains of transmission is key to ending the EVD epidemic and of even greater importance in the context of recent reports of Ebola virus (EBOV) persistence in survivors. Phylogenetic analysis of complete EBOV genomes can provide important information on the source of any new infection. A local deep sequencing facility was established at the Mateneh Ebola Treatment Center in central Sierra Leone. The facility included all wet lab and computational resources to rapidly process EBOV diagnostic samples into full genome sequences. We produced 554 EBOV genomes from EVD cases across Sierra Leone. These genomes provided a detailed description of EBOV evolution and facilitated phylogenetic tracking of new EVD cases. Importantly, we show that linked genomic and epidemiological data can not only support contact tracing, but also identify unconventional transmission chains involving body fluids, including semen.Rapid EBOV genome sequencing, when linked to epidemiolological information and a comprehensive database of virus sequences across the outbreak, provided a powerful tool for public health epidemic control efforts.]16 May 2016 UK: Nurse ""PC"" sick of being known as the Ebola nurse as she eyes return to work<http://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/pauline-cafferkey-sick-being-known-11336251>[The Scots nurse who almost died twice from the dangerous Ebola virus admits she is desperate to get back to work. ""PC"" opens up about her ordeal during an interview with Julie Etchingham for ITV's Tonight, which aired on Thu [19 Mar 2016]. The 40-year-old insisted she's sick of being known as the ""Ebola Nurse"" but says she has no regrets about going to Sierra Leone where she became infected with the killer virus.The nurse recalls pain so horrific she begged doctors to drill a hole in head, and how they saved her life not once but twice.She has confirmed plans to get on with her 18-year nursing career after straying into uncharted medical territory herself. ""PC"" said her expert knowledge of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] meant she couldn't bear to tell her family after she became infected in Sierra Leone in December 2014. She revealed: ""I asked my doctor to inform them because I couldn't do it. I was just thinking I could die a horrible death in a few days.""[It has been a long haul for her, and we can only hope she is able to go forward with her life with no further complications resulting from her infection with Ebola virus. - Mod.LK]Funding------18 May 2016: The risks of using Ebola funds to fight the Zika Virus<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/risks-ebola-funds-fight-zika-virus/story?id=39200645>[The battle over Zika funding continues on Capitol Hill [USA] this week, as Senators are expected to move a new USD 1.1 billion bill forward and House Republicans work on a separate funding measure using ""unobligated"" Ebola funds. The House of Representatives' proposal calls for USD 350 million in unobligated Ebola funds to help fund their new USD 622 million proposal to fight Zika, about 1/3rd of the funds President Obama has requested.The White House has threatened to veto the measure, saying it is inadequate, and it could only fund efforts to fight [Zika virus disease (ZIKV)] through September [2016]. However, questions remain about whether using Ebola funds to fight ZIKV is good budgeting or dangerous to public health. While some funds previously allocated in the fight against [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] have yet to be spent, they are not actually ""unobligated.""] ...-more[The report goes on to discuss the real need for the Ebola funds in rebuilding the public health infrastructure in West Africa. Sustainable funding to maintain health facilities and support personnel with expertise is critical to responding to outbreaks rapidly. - Mod.LK]18 May 2016 Sierra Leone: Digital wallets helped Sierra Leone contain Ebola outbreak: study<http://www.nation.co.ke/news/United-Nation-ebola/-/1056/3208960/-/7djm9iz/-/index.html>[By using a digital system to pay Ebola response workers, Sierra Leone massively cut down on time spent, avoiding large-scale strikes and ensuring a stable workforce to defeat Ebola, the United Nation's survey called the ""Better Than Cash Alliance"" showed. The speed with which Ebola spread meant the government needed a more efficient, reliable and secure measure to manage payments to response workers in a country where there were fewer than 50 ATMs when the outbreak struck.]20 May 2016: World Bank creates pandemic insurance plan after slow Ebola response<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-21/after-ebola-world-bank-creates-pandemic-insurance-plan/7434616>[The World Bank has announced a new program to quickly mobilize funds against virulent disease outbreaks after the world was caught unprepared in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said the new Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) will accelerate global and national responses to disease outbreaks that threaten large populations and fragile economies. He said the PEF, a combination of catastrophe insurance and bonds, is a direct reaction to the sluggish donor response to the outbreak of [the Ebola virus disease (EVD)], which killed thousands and shut down economic activity for months.According to Dr. Kim, ""The recent Ebola crisis in West Africa was a tragedy that we were simply not prepared for. It was a wake-up call to the entire world. We can't change the speed of a hurricane or the magnitude of an earthquake, but we can change the trajectory of an outbreak. With enough money sent to the right place at the right time, we can save lives and protect economies.""][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png> - Mods.LK/JWHealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54> Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>][See Also:Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.390819].................................................lk/msp/mpp"
