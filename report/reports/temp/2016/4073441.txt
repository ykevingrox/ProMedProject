This genotype is the same as that of the strain causing IMD among men who have sex with men (MSM) in France and Germany. IMD cases in MSM living in the Paris region was linked to the circulation since mid-2013 of C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:cc11 isolates, and this strain is also reported to be the same as that causing the outbreak of IMD in MSM in Germany (<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V20N03/art21016.pdf>). This genotype caused IMD not only in MSM, but also in individuals (women, as well as those men who do not identify as MSM) who attended social venues associated with the gay community in France (<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V20N03/art21016.pdf>). ProMED-mail would appreciate any information on contacts of cases of IMD in Tuscany with MSM or social venues associated with the gay community, if available, from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>.]
