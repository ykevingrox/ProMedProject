Ottawa Citizen [edited]<http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/three-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-ottawa-and-lanark-county>Ottawa Public Health [OPH] says that children who have not been vaccinated for the measles could be required to stay away from school for up to 3 weeks if they've come in contact with any of the 3 recently diagnosed measles patients.The 1st case was confirmed [Wed 31 Aug 2016], and OPH and the Leeds, Grenville, and Lanark District Health Unit have since contacted 500 individuals who might have been exposed to the measles patients. All 3 cases involved children who were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated, and all 3 cases were related. As of Monday morning [5 Sep 2016], no further cases had been reported.In Ontario, it's recommended that youngsters get 2 doses of the measles vaccine, the 1st soon after 1st first birthday, and a 2nd at between 4 and 6 years of age. Students in primary or secondary schools in the province are required by the Immunization of School Pupils Act to show proof of immunization from the measles and certain other diseases before they can attend school. Exemptions are permitted, though, for medical reasons or matters of conscience or religious belief.The measles virus is typically spread through coughing and sneezing. It can cause ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea, blindness, brain inflammation, and death. Early symptoms, which usually occur 10 or 12 days after infection, include fever, cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Within 2 or 3 days of symptoms appearing, white spots may appear inside the mouth, followed by a red rash spreading from the face to the rest of the body.The local vaccination rate among schoolchildren is 98.4 per cent. The last case of the measles reported in the area was in 2014.According to Dr Carolyn Pim, associate medical officer of health at OPH, the virus can live in the air for up to 2 hours, which makes the process of tracking down people who might have been exposed difficult. She says there are 2 purposes for contacting these people. ""One is to identify the people who may benefit from things that we can do to prevent them from personally getting infections. If it's very soon after they've been exposed, a measles vaccine can be effective in preventing them from getting an infection."" Those at high risk, she notes, such as infants and people with weakened immune systems, may also benefit from an immune globulin IV to help boost their immune system. ""The 2nd is to advise people to watch out for signs and symptoms of measles, so we can catch it very early if they do develop measles.""If parents are unsure of whether their children have been properly vaccinated, Pim recommends they contact their physician or call Ottawa Public Health.The City of Ottawa provided a list of places, dates and times that individuals may have been exposed [see source URL above].People who have not previously had the measles or have not been fully vaccinated and who might have been exposed in the listed areas are asked to watch for any signs and symptoms of the measles and avoid contact with individuals who are at high risk for complications of the measles (infants less than 12 months of age, pregnant women, and people with weak immune systems) for 21 days after exposure date.Anyone who thinks they or a family member has the measles is asked to call a health-care provider immediately.

As well, 2 persons at the Justin Bieber concert likely received the virus from the man.By the morning of [31 Aug 2016], Kansai Airports had confirmed 16 employees had measles.Measles is a highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory system.
