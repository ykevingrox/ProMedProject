Ynet [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, edited]<http://www.ynet.co.il/Ext/Comp/ArticleLayout/CdaArticlePrintPreview/0,2506,L-4842350,00.html>Two patients are hospitalized at Meir Medical and another patient at Schneider Hospital in Petach Tikvah. They suffer from brucellosis following the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk produced by ""Bereshit"". This was reported today (Tue 16 Aug 2016) from the Ministry of Health. Their condition is mild to moderate. Last week, 2 children were hospitalized for mild to moderate condition at Ichilov Hospital, after drinking camel milk marketed by the said company. Following their admission, MOH officials ordered the destruction of 4 tons of camel milk.M. Sh. (64) and his wife from Kfar Sava have suffered high fever during the recent weeks.""Four months ago, we started to drink camel milk of Bereshit, after being convinced that it had medicinal properties,"" he said. ""They told us that many people drink this milk, and everything was fine. We did not think anything would happen to us, even if the milk was unpasteurized.""åÊHe said, ""They told us that the production is supervised and controlled and insisted that there was nothing to worry about."" But 3 weeks ago he and his wife began to feel ill and suffered from high fever. ""After 4 days of unexplained elevated body temperature, we went to the family doctor; she referred us to tests, but nothing was found. The fever did not decline; we suffered madening sweat bouts, weakness and loss of appetite,"" he said. ""Throughout the period, we did not know what we had; we did a series of tests, and, even when they asked us if we had connection with animals, we responded negatively because we did not see the connection,"" said M.Sh, ""until we read, last Thursday, about the 2 children infected by brucellosis and hospitalized at Ichilov and remembered that we similarly drank Bereshit milk"". He went to the Meir hospital [Kefar Saba], and after some tests it was decided to hospitalize him. ""My blood was sent to the reference laboratory, and they immediately started to treat me intravenously with antibotics. Yesterday [15 Aug 2016], the preliminary results confirmed the presence of the brucellosis bacterium. My wife has also been tested, and it is considered that she also got brucellosis,"" said [the patient]. ""I am expected to stay a week in the hospital and have to take the medication for another 6 weeks.""åÊ In the Schneider Children's Hospital [Petach Tiqva], a girl suspected of brucellosis after also drinking the Bereshit camel milk is hospitalized [see comment]. åÊDr. Michal Katzir, a specialist in infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Unit in the Meir Medical Center, said: ""_Brucella_ is a bacterium  transmitted in unpasteurized milk. The disease is usually expressed as fever, which can be accompanied by non-specific signs such as weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss and more. There may also be signs such as pain, infection of joints and bones,and it may involve nearly all body systems.åÊ""Most people develop the disease within 2 weeks to a month from exposure to the infective product, but it can be delayed. Therefore, a person who had consumed unpasteurized dairy products and developed symptoms should be examined. The blood tests include cultures and antibodies which testify for the presence of the bug. Recently, a considerable increase in the number of brucellosis patients has been recorded; it is therefore very important to avoid consuming unpasteurized dairy products and milk.""åÊThe Health Ministry issued a closure order for the ""Bereshit milk"" on Thursday [11 Aug 2016] and decided to destroy the products. A hearing of the company owner was scheduled for today [16 Aug 2016], but he has asked to postpone it due to illness, and therefore the hearing will be held next week. At the same time, it was decided to file a complaint against the company with respect to maintenance of food in inadequate conditions from an unknown source and without identification while endangering public health.[Byline: Rotem Elizera]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The infective milk was traced to a business located in Moshav Sitria near Rehovot, which sells camel milk under the label ""Bereshit (Genesis) Milk"", coined ""Milk from Eden"" on the plant's web-site, which includes a list of health conditions against which the product is advertised to be curative.On 11 Aug 2016, the MOH district director, Dr. Ofra Chavkin, issued a closure order to shut down the moshav business where the milk is sold. A press release, indicating the brucella contamination, was issued by the ministry at <http://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/11082016_3.aspx>.An interview on the brucellosis issue, with Prof. Shai Ashkenazi, infectious disease specialist at the Schneider Children's Hospital, was screened by Israel's Channel 1 News on 16 Aug 2016. Prof Ashkenazi referred to a 17-year-old girl suffering an immune-depressive condition, who had been drinking the product for 3 months before admittance to the hospital in a concerning condition, including a severe weigh-loss and arthritis. Her condition has improved following the several 1st days of the prescribed treatment. The expert expressed concern about the consumption of unpasteurized milk (""retreating hundreds of years backwards""), which could have caused additional, hitherto unreported or not yet recognised infections. The recognition may be delayed since the course of this disease may be long, signs developing slowly, and sometimes remaining insidious. - Mod.AS]******[2] CommentDate: Mon 15 Aug 2016From: Michael van Straten <vanstraten@hachaklait.co.il> [edited]Re: Brucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI-----------------------------------It must be stressed that the sale of raw camel milk (RCM), described in the above ProMED-mail post, was not clandestine; for years this product has been openly advertised on the internet and through other public media. The most important question from the public health point of view remains unanswered: How is it possible that RCM is being sold to the public without intervention of the authorities?_Brucella melitensis_ has been isolated from camel milk at least as early as 1992 (Ref. 1). Since then, such events have not been uncommon. Indeed, even in Israel, human brucellosis following ingestion of infected camel milk has been documented and published (Ref. 2).According to media sources (<http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001145581>, Hebrew), the camel farm in question was warned a year ago by the Ministry of Health about the sale of RCM; no actual measures were taken until the present cluster of brucellosis in children was made public.The situation is even worse: RCM is specifically being sold to and consumed by individuals belonging to sub-populations, including children, with malfunctioning immune systems. Individuals suffering from cancer, Crohn's disease, auto-immune diseases and other syndromes are lured to purchase RCM by evidence-deficient claims that it can cure these illnesses.References1.

Two positive camels were culled; the remaining animals in the group underwent repeated tests. According to animal health legislation, camels -- similar to cattle -- must be identified by official eartags.The brucellosis issue, in particular its relevance to food safety, has been discussed during an emergency meeting of the Knesset's Labor, Welfare and Health Committee, held on Tue 15 Aug 2016, during the Knesset's vacation. This has been the 2nd emergency meeting of a committee in the Knesset since the start of the current food-safety crisis (late July 2016, salmonella in cereals). The Knesset's State Control Committee convened on Thu 11 Aug 2016; transparency in the food industry and the functionality of the responsibe authorities were focused. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.]
