PRI, Agence France-Presse report [edited]<http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-10-13/world-health-organization-warns-global-tuberculosis-epidemic-larger-previously>The tuberculosis [TB] epidemic is larger than previously thought, infecting 10.4 million people last year [2015], while research into vaccines and cures is ""severely underfunded"", the World Health Organization warned on Thursday [13 Oct 2016] [1]. This was in contrast to last year's report by the United Nations health agency, which said 9.6 million people were sickened with TB worldwide.Deaths also rose across the planet, with 1.8 million people dying of TB last year [2015], 300 000 more than a year earlier, according to WHO's Global TB Report 2016. ""We face an uphill battle to reach the global targets for tuberculosis,"" said Margaret Chan, WHO director general. ""There must be a massive scale-up of efforts, or countries will continue to run behind this deadly epidemic and these ambitious goals will be missed.""2 out of 5 people who fell sick with the disease -- caused by a bacteria [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_] that infects the lungs and makes people cough up blood -- went undiagnosed and untreated. Nearly half a million people were diagnosed with multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), with about half of those cases in India, China, and the Russian Federation.""WHO's annual look at the global state of tuberculosis this year makes for a shockingly bad report card,"" said a statement from Doctors Without Borders [Medecins sans Frontieres]. ""The WHO Global TB Report is a wake-up call to break the status quo in how TB, and its drug-resistant forms, are being diagnosed and treated.""Six countries accounted for 60 per cent of the new cases: India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa. According to the report, the size of the epidemic rose largely because researchers realized that earlier estimates in India from 2000-2015 were too low. Better data has allowed experts to improve their assessment of the size of the problem, Ariel Pablos-Mendez, assistant administrator for Global Health at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) told reporters at a press conference in Washington.Despite the larger size of the epidemic, looking back over the past 15 years, TB deaths still fell by 22 per cent, said the report. But TB remained one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide last year, and while the overall rate of TB infection worldwide is falling, the pace is not fast enough, the WHO report warned. ""Worldwide, the rate of decline in TB incidence remained at only 1.5 per cent from 2014 to 2015,"" it said. ""This needs to accelerate to a 4 to 5 per cent annual decline by 2020 to reach the 1st milestones of the End TB Strategy.""The goal aims for a 35 per cent reduction in the absolute number of TB deaths and a 20 per cent reduction in the TB incidence rate by 2020, compared with levels in 2015. Governments at the World Health Assembly and at the United Nations General Assembly have called to for a 90 per cent reduction in TB deaths and an 80 per cent reduction in TB cases by 2030 compared with 2015.Cash shortages are also a persistent problem. ""Funding during the decade 2005-2014 never exceeded USD 0.7 billion per year,"" said the report. The amount of money being spent on research and development for TB treatments needs to be at least USD 2 billion per year, it added. ""The resources deployed against TB, the leading infectious killer in the world, are falling short,"" said Pablos-Mendez. ""The development aid community needs to step up more investments now, or we will simply not end one of the world's oldest and deadliest diseases.""[1. WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2016 <http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/>.]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The following has been extracted from the WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2016. The full report is available at <http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/>:Background----------""The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 were adopted by the United Nations in 2015. One of the targets is to end the global TB epidemic. The WHO End TB Strategy, approved by the World Health Assembly in 2014, calls for a 90 per cent reduction in TB deaths and an 80 per cent reduction in the TB incidence rate by 2030, compared with 2015.""This global TB report is the 1st to be produced in the era of the SDGs and the End TB Strategy. It provides an assessment of the TB epidemic and progress in TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention efforts, as well as an overview of TB-specific financing and research. It also discusses the broader agenda of universal health coverage, social protection and other SDGs that have an impact on health. Data were available for 202 countries and territories that account for over 99 percent of the world's population and TB cases.""Main findings and messages--------------------------""Status of the TB epidemic and MDR-TB crisis:The TB epidemic is larger than previously estimated, reflecting new surveillance and survey data from India. However, the number of TB deaths and the TB incidence rate continue to fall globally and in India.""In 2015, there were an estimated 10.4 million new (incident) TB cases worldwide, of which 5.9 million (56 per cent) were among men, 3.5 million (34 per cent) among women and 1.0 million (10 per cent) among children. People living with HIV accounted for 1.2 million (11 per cent) of all new TB cases.""Six countries accounted for 60 per cent of the new cases: India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa. Global progress depends on major advances in TB prevention and care in these countries. Worldwide, the rate of decline in TB incidence remained at only 1.5 per cent from 2014 to 2015. This needs to accelerate to a 4-5 per cent annual decline by 2020 to reach the 1st milestones of the End TB Strategy.""In 2015, there were an estimated 480 000 new cases of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and an additional 100 000 people with rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) who were also newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment. India, China and the Russian Federation accounted for 45 per cent of the combined total of 580 000 cases.""There were an estimated 1.4 million TB deaths in 2015, and an additional 0.4 million deaths resulting from TB disease among people living with HIV. Although the number of TB deaths fell by 22 per cent between 2000 and 2015, TB remained one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide in 2015.""TB research and development---------------------------""At least USD 2 billion per year is needed for TB research and development. Funding during the decade 2005-2014 never exceeded USD 0.7 billion per year.""In 2016, 4 diagnostic tests were reviewed and recommended by WHO: the loop-mediated isothermal amplification test for TB (known as TB-LAMP), 2 line probe assays (LPAs) for the detection of resistance to the 1stline anti-TB drugs isoniazid and rifampicin, and an LPA for the detection of resistance to 2nd-line anti-TB drugs. A next-generation cartridge called Xpert Ultra and a new diagnostic platform called GeneXpert Omni are in development; assessment of both by WHO is expected in 2017.""There are 9 drugs in advanced phases of clinical trials for the treatment of drug-susceptible TB, drug-resistant TB or LTBI. These are bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid, PBTZ169, pretomanid, Q203, rifampicin (high-dose), rifapentine and sutezolid. There are 13 vaccine candidates in clinical trials, including candidates for prevention of TB infection and candidates for prevention of TB disease in people with LTBI."" - Mod.ML]
