The above update is helpful in understanding a bit why it is difficult to follow the cases closely as oftentimes between the initial report and the WHO update, more information becomes available, at times including the location of the case geographically. A total of 8 of the 9 cases were classified as primary cases with 2 having a history of direct contact with camels, 3 indirect contact with camels, 1 still under investigation and 2 with a history of no contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.The cases that remain curious are those classified as primary cases but do not have a history of known contact with camels. It would be of interest to see studies delving into possible high risk transmission exposures of these individuals, to get a better handle on what these routes of transmission may be -- possibly asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases that were not tested for MERS-CoV infection but were contagious.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]******[3] South Korea - prognostic value of detecting viral RNA in blood - EIDDate: 29 Jul 2016Source: CDC, Emerging Infectious Diseases [edited]<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/10/16-0218_article>Citation: Kim SY, Park SJ, Cho SY, Cha RH, Jee HG, Kim G, Shin HS, Yeonjae K, Jung YM, Yang JS, Kim SS, Cho SI, Kim MJ, Lee JS, Lee SJ, Seo SH, Park SS, and Seon MW: Viral RNA in blood as indicator of severe outcome in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016; 22(10) Oct [date cited]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2210.160218. Available at the URL above.AbstractWe evaluated the diagnostic and clinical usefulness of blood specimens to detect Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in 21 patients from the 2015 outbreak in South Korea. Viral RNA was detected in blood from 33 percent of patients at initial diagnosis, and the detection preceded a worse clinical course.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The authors had a stated aim to evaluate the diagnostic value of blood specimens for viral RNA identification and to see if there was a relationship between blood viral detection and clinical course. They collected 21 pairs of whole blood and serum specimens from 21 patients with laboratory confirmed pulmonary specimens for MERS-CoV infection. Testing was done using 1-step real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR). They detected viral RNA in 6 of the 21 whole blood specimens (29 percent) and 6 of the 21 (29 percent) serum samples from admission samples. 2 patients had viral detection in either specimen (whole blood or serum), giving an overall detection rate of 7 out of 21 or 33 percent.Findings included an association with ""fever greater than 37.5 deg C [approx. 99.5 deg F] on the sampling date (p equal 0.007), requirement for mechanical ventilation during the following clinical course (p equal 0.003) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p equal 0.025), and patient death (p equal 0.025). Blood viral RNA positivity was not associated with viral Ct in the initial diagnostic lower respiratory specimens, or requirement of oxygen supplementation during the following clinical course.""Interestingly, viral loads in the lower respiratory specimens were not associated with patient survival probability, nor was death associated with length of time from symptom onset to diagnosis.The authors observed that their data showed that blood viral RNA was present in a subpopulation of patients that had poorer outcome prognoses. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>.]
