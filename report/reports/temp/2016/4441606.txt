Many governments fail to perform quality control of imported drugs especially when new suppliers are used even though easy to use rapid tests are available (Visser BJ, de Vries SG, Bache EB, et al. The diagnostic accuracy of the hand-held Raman spectrometer for the identification of anti-malarial drugs. Malar J. 2016 Mar 15;15:160. doi: 10.1186/s12936-016-1212-y).Once a supplier of inferior or direct counterfeit drugs has been identified this supplier should be prosecuted and if at all possible, closed.Counterfeit and substandard drugs are an important driver of the declining susceptibility to artemisinine in Cambodia, and in such situations the delivery of free malaria medications is probably the only option to stop inferior drugs being used. ProMED thanks Dr. Caillet for this submission.  She also states: ""Further information on the quality of antimalarials can be found on the WWARN Antimalarial Quality literature map ('AQ surveyor') that visualizes summaries of published reports of antimalarial medicine quality, displaying their geographical distribution across regions and over time at: <http://www.wwarn.org/aqsurveyor/#0>.""  - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>.]
