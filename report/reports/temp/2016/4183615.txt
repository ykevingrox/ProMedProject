This airline map shows where international flights reach from Entebbe, Uganda, where cases of yellow fever have occurred recently <http://flirt.eha.io/simulation/e1b6dbc2627a90148ad42e307d68586f>.If _Aedes aegypti_ control worked, there would be much less dengue, chikungunya and Zika in the world. But it has not worked. Aerial and ground spraying are useless because they only kill outdoor mosquitoes while the spray keeps falling, leaving many indoors -- where 70 per cent of biting occurs -- safe and sound. Outdoor mosquitoes are soon replaced by the hatching of larvae in uncollected refuse in the street, cisterns, rain barrels, courtyards, gardens, construction sites and tire dumps, cemetery flower pots, axils of decorative outdoor bromeliads and animal watering dishes, among a myriad other places.Use of transgenic mosquitoes, mosquito pathogens such as _Bacillus thuringensis_, wohlbachia bacteria and hormones to attack the larvae of the urban mosquito will take too long to scale up and apply. Available mycoinsecticides are of much lower toxicity than chemicals.Nevertheless, there is a place for _Ae. aegypti_ control, in planning to contain yellow fever. Indoor spraying and outdoor peri-focal spraying with semi-persistent insecticides is effective, providing there is free access to all properties, including empty or abandoned ones. Because _Ae. aegypti_ bites by day, bednets, whether insecticide treated or not, are only useful to prevent infection of carers by bed-ridden patients at home or hospital staff, or in quarantine quarters. Recently, hundreds of people were reportedly blocked for several days from crossing the Uganda/Kenya border in either direction, waiting to be vaccinated and cleared to cross. That was an area where mosquito control of premises used during the day would have been valuable.Consideration should also be given to spraying in buses and flights arriving from an infected country before the passengers disembark, as some airlines already do, and inside container and other heavy goods traffic in which, for example, _Ae. aegypti_ have been found arriving in northern Australia. So there is no need to budget for hugely expensive aerial spraying or a fleet of pickups for ground fogging, but rather pass temporary laws to allow free access to all properties, lay in stocks of insecticides and hand sprayers, and train spray workers in advance.Quarantine and personal protection measures will be discussed in a future post.--John P ""Jack"" Woodall, PhDCo-founder & Associate Editor, ProMED-mail[I declare my interest: I researched yellow fever in Uganda and Brazil for 14 years, and was a staff member (epidemiologist) of CDC and WHO for a further 14 years. - Mod.JWExtreme vigilance will be needed at high-risk destinations including both formal and informal systems (with adequate lab capacity) for the early detection of cases of yellow fever.
