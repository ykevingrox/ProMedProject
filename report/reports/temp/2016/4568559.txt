The species was confirmed on 30 Sep [2016], using a variety of morphological and molecular techniques. Despite extensive mosquito trapping at UK sea and airports, imported tyre companies, and motorway service stations close to the ferry ports and Eurotunnel, this is the 1st time that this species has been detected in the UK.As part of this nationwide network of traps run by Public Health England entomologists, 37 eggs of _Aedes albopictus_ were found in a trap at a motorway service station near Folkestone, Kent in south-east England. Owing to the warmer climate in southern England, the ability for eggs to overwinter, and the connectivity of the lorry/coach park, the potential for establishment and further dissemination requires careful consideration. Enhanced surveillance around the site has found no further evidence of the mosquito. Local authorities have conducted control in aquatic habitats.--Jolyon MedlockHead of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses EcologyPublic Health EnglandMicrobiological Research Authority (MRA)Emergency Response DepartmentHealth Protection and Medical DirectoratePorton DownSalisbury SP4 0JG, UK<Jolyon.Medlock@phe.gov.uk>[Interestingly, there was a previous report of _Aedes albopictus_ in Kent in 2014, but was quickly refuted in a communication by Dr. Medlock. This time the report is true. Given the mobility of _Aedes albopictus_ through human activity, and its presence in the Mediterranean Basin, it is not surprising that this mosquito has been found in the UK. Because the Public Health England national network surveillance system has not found this mosquito elsewhere in the UK, this appears to be a geographically limited event. It will be interesting to see if the mosquito is found in other localities near the motorway service station.ProMED thanks Dr. Medlock for sending in this report. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6041>.][See Also:2014----Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment 20140923.2795988Invasive mosquito - UK: (England) 20140921.27923632007].................................................ml/ty/ao/ml"
