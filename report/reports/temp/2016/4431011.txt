Median age was young: 3.9 years for the former group and 2.0 for the latter.The team found that 1.1 percent of the flu B and 0.4 percent of the flu A patients died, meaning that patients in the former group were almost 3 times more likely to die from their infection. Among healthy children with influenza B, those 10 years or older, compared with babies younger than 6 months, had an almost 6-fold greater risk of admission to an intensive care unit.The researchers also determined that, compared with influenza A patients, influenza B patients were more likely to have a vaccine-indicated condition, and symptoms more often associated with influenza B were headache, abdominal pain, and muscle aches.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The full text article may be accessed at <http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2016/08/15/peds.2015-4643.full.pdf>.Influenza B accounts for a variable proportion of influenza cases each year. Over the last several decades, rates of hospitalization and mortality attributed to Influenza B have been lower than those associated with H3N2 subtype A, but they were higher than those linked to the less virulent seasonal H1N1 strains [1]. During the 2010-2011 season, 38 percent of all influenza associated pediatric deaths were attributed to influenza B, despite only 26 percent of all circulating viruses being of this type [2]. Half (49 percent) of these children who died had no known high-risk medical condition, and only 50 percent received any antiviral therapy, pointing to missed opportunities for intervention and prevention of complications.Based on 2001-2011 surveillance data in the United States (excluding the 2009-2010 pandemic), the percentage of total clinical isolates attributed to influenza B ranged from under 1- 44 percent. In 5 of these 10 years, the predominant circulating B lineage differed from the World Health Organization recommended B lineage for the Northern hemisphere trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), accounting for 77 percent to 98 percent of all influenza virus isolates [3].Data regarding the burden of influenza B compared with A are critical to understanding the impact of various strategies of incorporating quadrivalent influenza vaccine into an influenza immunization program.References:1.
