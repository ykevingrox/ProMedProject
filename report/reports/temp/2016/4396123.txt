Channel News Asia [edited]<http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/disease-kills-over-30/3014490.html>An undiagnosed disease has killed more than 30 children in a remote part of Myanmar[Burma], officials said Thu [4 Aug 2016], with health authorities struggling to treat victims. The illness, with measles-like symptoms, has hit the far corner of Myanmar's northern Sagaing region, a remote and mountainous area which borders eastern India and is populated by people from the Naga tribes.Adults and children have both been struck since the outbreak first emerged in June [2016], a local MP said, but the illness appears to be particularly deadly to children under the age of 5. ""Altogether 23 children were have been killed in Lahal [Lahe] township and 13 killed in Nan Yon township since June [2016] because of this unknown disease,"" Law Yon, a regional MP from Naga self-administrative region told AFP.""Rashes came out on their bodies, they have a fever and difficulty breathing because of coughing. Blood also comes out while coughing,"" he said. Some 200 people so far have come down with the disease, he said, adding that central authorities have been slow to react.A health ministry official in the capital Naypyidaw confirmed the outbreak, including more than 30 deaths, and said tests were being carried out. ""We assume at an initial stage it's a measles outbreak or strong influenza. But we can definitely say only when we get the result from laboratory,"" the official said, requesting anonymity.The outbreak highlights how vulnerable Myanmar's more remote populations are in a country where healthcare was never prioritized under decades of brutal and inept junta rule.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[2] Naga Self-Administered ZoneDate: Fri 5 Aug 2016Source: The Irrawaddy [edited]<http://www.irrawaddy.com/burma/death-toll-rises-as-unidentified-illness-sweeps-naga-region.html>An estimated 38 people--mostly children--have died from an as-yet unidentified and contagious illness in 2 townships within the Naga Self-Administered Zone in Burma's far north.Local authorities sent 2 doctors on Friday to the village of Thankholama in Lahe Township, the 1st location where the disease struck. Victims have presented with a cough, and then develop dark spots and lumps on their bodies. In the final stages of the illness, they vomit blood, explained Thein Zaw, the assistant director of the Naga Self-Administered Zone. ""We can say that for the meantime, we are able to somewhat control the situation regarding this disease. The death toll has reached 38,"" he said; of the 38 casualties, 34 were reportedly children under 15 years old, and 4 were elderly people.It remains unknown what illness is afflicting the people of both Lahe and Nanyun townships. Loyon, a lawmaker from Lahe Township, told The Irrawaddy that locals 1st suspected that the children were suffering from a more common condition, but as the death toll rose, people were alarmed by how little resistance or immunity patients appeared to exhibit toward the disease.Blood and urine samples from the patients are currently being transported to Rangoon for testing. ""We may come to know the type of disease after 10 or 15 days,"" Thein Zaw said, referring to the timeframe for testing. The authorities from the Naga Self-Administered Zone have no plan to declare a state of emergency, he said, but will send more medics to administer treatment.Meanwhile, in Lahe Township, Thein Zaw said that between 20 and 30 patients remain sick, with reportedly even more individuals affected in Nanyun Township, though official numbers for that region were not yet known.Naung Hang, a resident of Lahe town and a member of the Council of Naga Affairs, estimated that most of the Thankholama's 50 households had now been affected by the outbreak. ""It was hard to get access this village. This was why the medics could not get there on time to stop the outbreak,"" said Naung Hang; Thankholama is nearly 40 mi [approx 64 km] from Lahe town.Athong Makury, President of the Council of Naga Affairs, wrote a short note on his Facebook page on Thu [4 Aug 2016] about how the disease was 1st spotted, and then spread. He said that the 1st case appeared in Thankholama on 14 Jun [2016]. Within 1 month, 5 children had reportedly succumbed to the illness. Only then did the village authorities inform the medical department in Lahe Town, which also serves as the headquarters for the Naga Self-Administered Zone. Yet although medics tried to spread awareness about general disease prevention, locals say that no serious action was taken to contain the outbreak.Thankholama is particularly remote and isolated--accessible only by motorbike--in a region already severely lacking infrastructure; the Naga Self-Administered Zone, populated by the Naga ethnic group, is considered one of the poorest and most under-developed areas in Burma.[By Lawi Weng]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Naga is one of Myanmar's Self-Administered Zone consisting of 3 townships in Sagaing Region: Lahe, Leshi and Nanyun Township. It belongs to Sagaing region <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_Self-Administered_Zone>.The situation with increasing number of fatal cases in the Naga region requires investigation as the majority of the effected are children less than 15 years with a high mortality rate, with adults cases also being reported.Investigation regarding the epidemiological features of the early cases and course of disease in the fatal and recovered cases may help the health authorities establish a possible common source of the illness; whether it is infectious, parasitic or associated with environmental contamination or poisoning...The symptom complex of fever , cough and haemoptysis (coughing blood) are indicative that the respiratory tract is the main focus of the disease process, possible causes may include bacteria such as _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Chlamydophila pneumonia_ or _Legionella pneumophila_ and pneumonic plague caused by _Yersinia Pestis_. Possible viral causes are influenza, measles, a novel respiratory virus or even mycoplasma.The reports does not mention whether any specimens have been collected from the cases for laboratory testing ; this may provide further information regarding a possible cause of the underlying illness. Any further information from health officials and personnel on the ground in this regard, will be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/148>.]
