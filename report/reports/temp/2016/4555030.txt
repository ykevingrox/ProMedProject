Lusaka Times [edited]<https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/10/12/3-people-contracts-anthrax-chama-muchinga-province/>Three people have been confirmed to have anthrax, which has broken out in Chama district of Muchinga Province. Chama district commissioner Josphat Lombe said that this was from 53 people that were affected by the disease. Mr Lombe said that according to the Ministry of Health in the district, 235 people were believed to have eaten hippo meat.He said that 18 hippos from Luangwa River were reported to have died from anthrax which was eventually transmitted to humans after eating their meat. Mr Lombe said that a task force comprising of officers from Ministry of Health, Department of National Parks and Wildlife, and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries has been formed to monitor the situation.He noted that that it was unfortunate that some people have kept some meat from the affected hippos and were reluctant to surrender it to government so that it could be destroyed. Mr Lombe further revealed that officers have been deployed along the Luangwa River to stop people that were still trying to get their hands on the dead hippos.He has advised people in Lundazi and Chipata districts [Eastern province] not to buy bush meat which does not have valid papers from the Department of National Parks and Wildlife.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The dust is settling and we have laboratory confirmation of 3 human cases. There have been repeated announcements of the formation of a joint task force ""to monitor the situation"" but as yet no information of any action or deployment. Logically there will have been further hippo deaths, and maybe a spread of the disease in wildlife. And thus a widening of the temptation to butcher dead hippos.A map showing the Luangwa River (red) Valley through eastern Zambia and to where it joins the Zambezi River (blue) can be seen at <http://www.bornfree.org.uk/uploads/pics/river.jpg>.
