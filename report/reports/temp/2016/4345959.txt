However, its true prevalence is unknown since HHV-6A is typically undetectable in the blood or saliva.The study, which looked at 66 women, found that HHV-6A infects the uterus lining of 43 percent of the women with unexplained infertility, but it was nowhere to be found in the uterine lining of the fertile women.Further, the researchers found that the immune response to the herpesvirus may contribute to making a uterus less hospitable to a fertilized egg.Basically, the virus activates immune cells, called natural killer cells, in the uterus, and this leads to an increased production of proteins called cytokines. The immune system uses cytokines to attack foreign invaders (like viruses), but the researchers believe that the activated immune system cells and abnormal levels of certain cytokines may make it difficult for a fertilized egg to lodge in the uterus.""This is a surprising and potentially important discovery,"" Anthony Komaroff, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has studied the herpesvirus, said in a press release. ""If confirmed, the finding may lead to treatments that improve the outcome for a large subset of infertile women.""Unfortunately, finding a proper treatment for HHV-6A may take some time, since there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for HHV-6A.However, an HHV-6A infection in the uterine lining can be diagnosed using a standard biopsy procedure done by gynecologists, using a small suction device without a need for anesthesia.If further research confirms HHV-6A's role in infertility, perhaps researchers will have more incentive to work diligently towards an effective antiviral treatment.""Overall, our study indicates that HHV-6A infection might be an important factor in female primary unexplained infertility,"" the researchers conclude in the paper.[Byline: Kelly Tatera]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The reference for the paper cited above isMarci R, Gentili V, Bortolotti D, et al: Presence of HHV-6A in endometrial epithelial cells from women with primary unexplained infertility. PLoS One. 2016; 11(7): e0158304; available at <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158304>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThis finding, while it does not demonstrate causation, does pave the way for future studies that may contribute to correcting infertility problems in women, either through anti-viral compounds or a vaccine. It is of concern that HHV-6A generates itself in the salivary glands, thus making it transferable through kissing.Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is the common collective name for human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B). These closely related viruses are 2 of the 9 herpesviruses known to have humans as their primary host.HHV-6A and HHV-6B are double stranded DNA viruses within the betaherpesvirinae subfamily and of the genus _Roseolovirus_. HHV-6A and HHV-6B infect almost all of the human populations that have been tested.HHV-6B primary infection is the cause of the common childhood illness exanthema subitum (also known as roseola infantum or 6th disease). Additionally, HHV-6B reactivation is common in transplant recipients, which can cause several clinical manifestations such as encephalitis, bone marrow suppression, and pneumonitis.Excerpted from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_herpesvirus_6>.[Relative to HHV-6B], HHV-6A has been found more frequently in patients with neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rhomboencephalitis (Alvarez Lafuente 2006, Crawford 2007). It has also been suggested as co-factor in the progression of HIV to AIDS (Lusso 2007). HHV-6A is acquired later in life, usually without clinical symptoms, except in Africa where HHV-6A is more prevalent than HHV-6B in children (Kasolo 2009). HHV-6B antibodies are presumed to offer partial protection against HHV-6A and vice versa.It is only possible to differentiate HHV-6A from HHV-6B using a PCR DNA test, and due to the extremely low levels of latent virus in the blood, typing is difficult except when the virus is actively replicating during an acute illness. To make matters more complicated, the percentage of HHV-6A and HHV-6B DNA can vary dramatically depending on whether serum, saliva, or the white blood cells are used in the testing procedure. HHV-6B is more likely to be found in the white blood cells and in the saliva, while HHV-6A is more likely to be found in the spinal fluid or serum (Nitsche 2001). HHV-6A can't be found in the saliva (Aberle 1996).Excerpted from <http://hhv-6foundation.org/what-is-hhv-6/hhv-6a-hhv-6b>. - Mod.LK]
