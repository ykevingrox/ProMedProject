Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune,"" Dr Dowse said.""A person is considered immune to measles if they have previously received 2 doses of a measles vaccine or were born before 1966.""Dr Dowse said individuals who developed a fever with other symptoms -- including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash -- within 2-3 weeks of potential exposure to someone with measles, should stay at home and consult their doctor.""Anyone who thinks they are infected should call ahead and mention their possible contact with measles so they can be isolated when they arrive at the GP surgery or Emergency Department, to prevent infecting other patients and staff,"" Dr Dowse said.Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral illness spread by tiny droplets released when infected people cough and sneeze.Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles infections can be especially severe in infants and people with poor immune systems.Naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for about 20 years but occasional cases and small outbreaks occur associated with tourists or WA residents who are infected overseas.People born during or after 1966 should make sure they have had 2 doses of a measles vaccine at some stage in their life, especially before travelling overseas. If they are not sure if they have been vaccinated in the past, it does not hurt to have another dose.Complications following measles can be serious and include ear infections and pneumonia in about 10 per cent of cases. Around 40 per cent of cases require hospitalisation and about one person in every 1000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.[Byline: Regina Titelius]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In Japan, a combined measles-rubella vaccine started being administered twice per person in 2006.Japan's previous practice of one-time vaccination failed to confer immunity in many cases, leading to a widespread measles outbreak among people between 10 and 30 in 2007 that forced the closure of the entire university system.""Measles infections usually peak between spring and summer,"" said Keiko Taya, chief of the institute [National Institute of Infectious Diseases]'s Infectious Disease Surveillance Center. ...One in 1000 measles sufferers is said to die and adults tend to develop serious symptoms. Pregnant women with measles are at risk of miscarriage or premature birth.Japan is internationally known as a ""measles exporter.""The combined MMR vaccine touted in 1989 for measles, mumps and rubella gave rise to reports of severe side effects -- including some deaths. This caused it to be shunned by families, creating an entire generation of uninoculated kids in the '90s who are now turning into adults.(Excerpted and edited from <http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/09/national/signs-arrive-of-japans-latest-measles-outbreak/>) Japan is facing the same problem as many other developed countries, that is how to educate people that measles is not always a mild disease and the MMR vaccine will prevent measles, is safe and efficacious.A map of Japan can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>, and a map of West Australia can be found at <http://bit.ly/2eYvEM0>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Liberia (Margibi)Date: Thu 27 Oct 2016Source: The Bush Chicken [edited]<http://www.bushchicken.com/measles-outbreak-confirmed-in-margibi/>Measles Outbreak Confirmed in Margibi-------------------------------------The Margibi County Health Team has confirmed the 2nd outbreak of measles in the county this year [2016], with 4 confirmed cases so far.According to the county disease surveillance officer, Leroy Maximore, the outbreak is in the Firestone Rubber Plantation area and the health team is doing all it can to contain the outbreak.He said in the 1st 3 weeks of October [2016], the Firestone Health District has reported 15 cases of measles, of which 4 were confirmed positive and 6 negative. The rest of the results are yet to be known, pending the completion of the laboratory tests.Maximore described the current situation as an epidemic in the county and said the county was treating it as a health emergency.He said a team of health volunteers is currently carrying out active surveillance and those affected are undergoing medical treatment.In March of this year [2016], there was 1 death and 26 confirmed cases of measles. In April 2015, a total of 77 cases were recorded along with 6 deaths.Maximore said the Firestone Health District is the epicenter of the current outbreak; there are no suspected or confirmed measles cases in the remaining 3 health districts. He blamed the outbreak on the natural rubber company.""The problem we have had with the Firestone health authorities is their failure to carry out 24/7 routine vaccinations,"" Maximore said. ""Instead, they only do it once a week and this has made people vulnerable to contagious diseases.""Meanwhile, the health surveillance officer is calling on partners to help provide the necessary support to enable the county's health team to prevent future spread of the disease.He said if nothing is done in the next few days to promptly handle the outbreak, there could be an increase in the number of cases in the area.Maximore said between January and October of this year [2016], the county has reported 253 cases of measles in the 4 health districts, with a fatality rate of 0.79 percent.[Byline: Emmanuel Degleh]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Liberia can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>. - Mod.LK]******[3] USA-subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)Date: Fri 28 Oct 2016Source: Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-measles-idUSKCN12S226>Fatal measles complication more common than thought: U.S. study---------------------------------------------------------------A deadly complication of measles in young children that strikes years after infection may be more common than previously thought, according to a study presented on Friday [28 Oct 2016] that stressed the importance of vaccinations against the highly contagious disease.The risk of acquiring the always fatal neurological disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), was believed to be about 1-in-1700, based on an earlier German study of children under 5 years of age infected with measles.The new research, looking at children who got measles during a large California [USA] outbreak around 1990, found the rate of SSPE to be 1-in-1387 for those infected before the age of 5. It rose to about 1-in-600 for babies infected before their 1st birthday.""That is a very frightening surprise,"" said Dr. James Cherry, a research professor in pediatric infectious diseases at UCLA, who was part of the study team.""The answer is good public health. You need to vaccinate everybody and create herd immunity so that you protect those most vulnerable to measles and those at greatest risk of SSPE,"" Cherry said in a telephone interview.Herd immunity would protect infants too young to get the measles vaccine and people with compromised immune systems ineligible for vaccination.The average age of SSPE diagnosis was 12, but the range was from 3-35, researchers said.The findings were presented at an infectious disease meeting in New Orleans known as ID Week [ID Week meeting 26-30 Oct 2016 New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Session: Vaccines, Vaccine Preventable Disease, and their Impact <http://bit.ly/2eVcPJv>].The presentation included an account of a mother whose 5-month-old got measles after a trip to Disneyland during an outbreak last year [2015].""She says 'Now I have to worry about this for the next 10 years.' It's kind of sobering,"" Cherry said.Merck & Co and GlaxoSmithKline are among the main manufacturers of measles vaccines.Researchers hope the data will raise alarms with parents who refuse vaccines for their children, despite science confirming their safety and benefits.They also cautioned parents about traveling with unprotected children to countries where measles is endemic.""No child should go to Europe or the Philippines who hasn't had 2 doses of measles vaccine. It's just too risky,"" Cherry said.Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert from Houston [Texas, USA] who was not involved in the study, said a growing anti-vaccination movement in Texas could lead to measles outbreaks there.""Once vaccination coverage rates start going below 90 to 95 percent, because it's so highly infectious, that's when you start to see measles. It's going to come back and it's not a benign disease,"" Hotez said.Even without SSPE, measles can kill or cause encephalitis.""We have to vaccinate our kids or we are going to suffer the consequences,"" Hotez warned.[Byline: Bill Berkrot]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is an important study by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) that adds even more fuel to the fire stressing the public health and life saving importance of the MMR vaccine [see ProMED-mail post Vaccination: cost of not vaccinating 20161026.4586152]. The public generally considers measles to be a benign disease of children. But it can be very serious, even life threatening. This paper, presented at ID Week 2016, makes this clear. The report, entitled ""Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis: the Devastating Measles Complication is More Common than We Think"" by K Wendorf et al., concludes:""SSPE cases in California occurred at much higher rate than previously published among unvaccinated children who were infected with measles in infancy. Protection of infants younger than 12-15 months of age, when measles vaccine is routinely administered, requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SSPE in patients with compatible symptoms, even in older patients with no specific history of measles infection. SSPE demonstrates the high human cost of 'natural' measles immunity.""Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus. SSPE has been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare disease in developed countries, with fewer than 10 cases per year reported in the United States [but the report above suggests this estimate is low]. The incidence of SSPE declined by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread immunization with measles vaccine. The incidence of SSPE is still high in developing countries such as India and Eastern Europe. There is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female: 3/1). Most youngsters with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. Despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset of SSPE, researchers think that the infection of the brain occurs soon after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly. Why it persists and progresses still isn't clear. The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Some people may become blind. In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. There is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system.Currently, there is no cure for SSPE. Clinical trials of antiviral (isoprinosine and ribavirin) and immunomodulatory (interferon alpha) drugs have suggested that these types of therapies given alone or in combination halt the progression of the disease and can prolong life, but their long-term effects on individuals, and eventual outcome, are unknown. Good nursing care is the most important aspect of treatment for SSPE, along with anticonvulsant and antispasmodic drugs when needed.Most individuals with SSPE will die within 1 to 3 years of diagnosis. In a small percentage of people, the disease will progress rapidly, leading to death over a short course within 3 months of diagnosis. Another small group will have a chronic, slowly progressive form, some with relapses and remissions. A very small number (approximately 5 percent) may experience spontaneous long term improvement and regain lost function. Prevention, in the form of measles vaccination, is the only real ""cure"" for SSPE.(<http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/subacute_panencephalitis/subacute_panencephalitis.htm>)A map of the United States can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>. - Mod.LK]******[4] RomaniaDate: Fri 28 Oct 2016Source: Romania-Insider [edited]<http://www.romania-insider.com/romania-registers-almost-1000-measles-cases-year/>Romania measles cases registered this year [2016] rise to almost 1000, linked to anti-vaccination campaign--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A total of 935 cases of measles have been registered in Romania this year by 28 Oct [2016], 150 of which have been reported in the past month, according to the Ministry of Health.Moreover, the Ministry also says that the infection has killed 6 people this year. Two deaths have been reported in the last few days in Arad county. A 27-year-old woman, who was apparently HIV positive, died at the hospital. A 1-year-old baby girl also died in a village near Arad. Apparently, she had a bad medical condition due to malnutrition, as she only weighed 6 kilograms.Measles cases were reported in 30 counties, with most of them being registered in Arad county, namely 223. Mures county comes next with 190 cases registered by 28 Oct [2016], followed by Bistrita with 128 cases, Timis - 91, Cluj - 90, Caras-Severin - 39, Brasov - 37, Suceava - 34, Hunedoara - 18, Dolj - 15, Bihor - 13, and Salaj - 11. Only 3 cases were registered in Bucharest.""Most cases are outbreaks in communities with low vaccine coverage,"" reads the Ministry's statement.Other counties that have reported cases of measles were Harghita, Alba, Iasi, Olt, Sibiu, Bacau, Constanta, Dambovita, Neamt, Braila, Giurgiu, Mehedinti, Vaslui, Botosani, Buzau, Prahova, and Valcea.The Health Ministry advises parents to respect the vaccination schedule, and to address family doctors for immunization.The high number of cases could be the result of the anti-vaccination campaign that has drawn a lot of supporters among Romanian parents in recent years. Those who oppose vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella claim that the vaccine causes autism.Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on the World Health Organization's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.[Byline: Irina Popescu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[More countries suffering from anti-vaccination sentiments precipitated by Andrew Wakefield's 1998 Lancet publication, even though epidemiologic studies subsequently refuted it.A map of Romania can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Mod.LK]
