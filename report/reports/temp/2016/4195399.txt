PoultryMed [edited]<http://www.poultrymed.com/poultry/templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=178&FID=1868&IID=36522>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released a new interim report that measures antimicrobial resistance in _Salmonella_ isolated from raw retail meat and poultry collected through the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) (1). The 2014-2015 Retail Meat Interim Report contains data from January 2014 - June 2015. It focuses only on _Salmonella_, a major pathogen of concern in foodborne disease outbreaks. Information includes serotype distribution, prevalence by food source and state, selected resistance patterns, and a list of all the identified antimicrobial resistance genes. To provide data in a timelier manner, the FDA intends to issue retail meat interim reports twice per year. In this report FDA also includes, for the 1st time, whole-genome sequencing data for _Salmonella_.NARMS was established in 1996 as a partnership between the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track antibiotic resistance in foodborne bacteria for drugs that are considered important in human medicine, including whether they are multidrug resistant (resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics). NARMS is critically important for monitoring trends in antimicrobial resistance among foodborne bacteria collected from humans, retail meats and food animals. In particular, it assists the FDA in making data-driven decisions on the approval of safe and effective antimicrobial drugs for animals.The retail meat arm of the NARMS program collects samples of grocery store chicken, ground turkey, ground beef and pork chops, and tests for non-typhoidal _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Enterococcus_ to determine whether such bacteria are resistant to various antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. _Enterococcus_ and most _E. coli_ are not considered major foodborne pathogens but are included because they are helpful in understanding how resistance occurs and spreads.Encouraging Trends--------------In many important categories, encouraging improvements found in 2011 continued to be evident in the latest data. The prevalence of _Salmonella_ in retail poultry is at its lowest level since testing began in 2002. In ground turkey, the prevalence of _Salmonella_ has declined from a high of 19% in 2008 to 6% in 2014. In retail chicken over the same time period, it has dropped from 15% to 9%._Salmonella_ resistance to ceftriaxone (an important antibiotic used to treat seriously ill patients) from chicken sources continued to decline steadily from a high of 38% in retail chicken meats in 2009 to 18% in 2014, and 5% during the 1st half of 2015. In ground turkey isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was detected in 7% of 2014 isolates and 4% of 2015 isolates collected through June, which represents an 80% decline since 2011 when resistance peaked at 22%.Fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin are classified as critically important for the treatment of _Salmonella_ infections. Ciprofloxacin resistance was absent in _Salmonella_ from poultry and beef, although a single isolate was found in pork. All _Salmonella_ from retail meats were susceptible to azithromycin, another important antibiotic recommended for the treatment of _Salmonella_ and other intestinal pathogens. Multidrug resistance in _Salmonella_ continued to show a downward drift in chicken and turkey from 2011 levels of 45% and 50%, respectively, to 20% and 36% in June 2015.Findings of Concern-----------------FDA identified the 1st instance of ciprofloxacin resistance in an isolate from retail pork, and identified the genes associated with this resistance for future tracking. One ceftriaxone-resistant retail chicken isolate from 2014 had the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene blaCTX-M-65. This is the 1st time this important class of resistance gene was detected in the U.S. This ESBL gene causes resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, including 3rd generation cephalosporins, resulting in fewer treatment options for infected patients. While only 3 isolates of _Salmonella_ serotype Dublin were recovered from meats (ground beef) in 2014, they exhibited extensive resistance patterns as in the past, showing resistance to 9-12 of 14 drugs tested.[1. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CVM Updates. April 28, 2016. FDA NARMS Retail Meat Interim Report for Salmonella Shows Encouraging Early Trends Continue; Includes Whole Genome Sequencing Data for the 1st Time. Available at: <http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm498038.htm>.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report refers to an interim report by the U.S. FDA referenced above (1) on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ (NTS) isolated from raw retail meat and poultry from January 2014 - June 2015, collected through the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). More detailed, tabulated data can be found in Tables 1a/b, 2a/b, 3a/b, and 4a/b at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/AntimicrobialResistance/NationalAntimicrobialResistanceMonitoringSystem/UCM498134.pdf>.Although it is heartening that the prevalence of NTS in retail poultry is at its lowest level since testing began in 2002, the fact that NTS can be found overall in 1 of 12 (8.3%) samples of retail chicken and in almost 1 of 13 (7.6%) samples of ground turkey in 2015 is nevertheless disturbing (Tables 2a and b). In some states, moreover, the frequency was much higher; in New Mexico, for example, NTS was found in 27 of 90 (30%) samples of retail chicken in 2014 and in 20 of 120 (16.7%) in 2015. In Maryland, NTS was found in 18 of 120 (15%) samples of ground turkey in 2014 and in 13 of 60 (21.7%) in 2015 (Tables 2a and b).Severe NTS infections are commonly treated with fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or with extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. The emergence of NTS isolates that display resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones is of increasing public health concern. Fluoroquinolone resistance was found in only 1 isolate from retail pork, but ceftriaxone resistance was found in 5 of 13 (38%) isolates from ground beef, 25 of 143 (17.5%) isolates from retail chicken, and 6 of 86 (7%) from ground turkey in 2014; lower frequencies were found in 2015 (Tables 3a and b). Ten to 38% of isolates were multidrug resistant, i.e., resistant to 3 or more classes of antimicrobial drugs (Tables 3a and b).Antimicrobial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosphorin antibiotics such as ceftriaxone is conferred by AmpC beta-lactamases or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). These resistance genes are frequently encoded on mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, that can make antimicrobial resistance highly transmissible between bacteria. CMY, a type of AmpC beta-lactamase, was commonly found in NTS in this study (Tables 4a and b) and 1 ceftriaxone-resistant retail chicken isolate from 2014 had the ESBL gene CTX-M (Table 4a).There are multiple types of ESBL genes, e.g., TEM, SHV, CTX-M, OXA, each with multiple subtypes. The most commonly reported ESBLs in the U.S. have been TEM- and SHV-derived, but the CTX-M class of beta-lactamase enzymes have become increasingly common in the U.S. in Enterobacteriaceae (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2151438/>), and have been found in NTS as well (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3204627/>).The FDA suggests that consumers can help protect themselves from these foodborne bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, by following 4 basic food safety tips: clean, separate, cook, chill.
