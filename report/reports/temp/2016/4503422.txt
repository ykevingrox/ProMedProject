""One (piece of) good news is that this outbreak is under control now. We haven't had any new cases in Angola since 23 Jun [2016], and since 12 Jul [2016] in the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo),"" Briand told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva.The entire Congolese capital of Kinshasa, 7.7 million people, had been vaccinated in less than 10 days, as well as 3 million in border areas to prevent transmission from Angola, and another 3 million on the Angolan side of the border, where a 2nd phase of vaccinations would be carried out soon.""So far in Angola more than 15 million people (have been vaccinated), this represents 65 percent of the population. So we still have to protect certain districts and provinces but the risk of a major outbreak I think is now over,"" she said. But there were still 32 endemic countries in Africa, so further outbreaks could not be ruled out, including in the parts of Congo that had not been vaccinated recently, she said.At the end of August [2016] the WHO said the trend was ""extremely positive"" but it was too early to say the outbreak had been stopped completely, with 1000 confirmed cases and up to 6000 suspected cases of the mosquito-borne disease.The outbreak is the worst in decades among unprotected African populations and has killed more than 400 people.The vaccination campaigns have depleted the global stockpile of 6 million doses twice this year, forcing doctors to switch to administering one-5th of the normal dose, a tactic that the WHO says gives at least temporary protection from the disease. On Mon [12 Sep 2016] experts from WHO and other health agencies met in Geneva to discuss a long-term strategy to prevent future large outbreaks of yellow fever.The risk of such outbreaks has risen due to urbanization and increasing mobility of the population, and this year it was especially acute because of the El Nino weather phenomenon which multiplied mosquito numbers, she said. The recent mass vaccination campaign aimed not only to stop the transmission of the virus but also to preempt transmission during the rainy season, which is already starting in some areas, Briand said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The absence of recent yellow fever cases in Angola and in the DR Congo is good news, indeed. One hopes that there are no smoldering, undetected foci in rural areas that are difficult to access as the rainy season begins. Continued surveillance in all areas is essential to detect any new cases and respond quickly with vaccination. It will be interesting to see if changes in response strategies by WHO, ministries of health and collaborating international organizations come out of this large and difficult outbreak. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>]
