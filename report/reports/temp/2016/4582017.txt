Detroit News [edited]<http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/10/20/genesee-legionnaires/92465354/>Two new cases of Legionnaires' disease have been reported in Genesee County, [Michigan] bringing the yearly total in that county to 14 cases, according to the health department.Officials did not provide further information about the 2 cases, which are being investigated by the health department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with the previous infections.Legionnaires' disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which are found in warm, fresh water and can cause pneumonia or a milder illness called Pontiac fever. All pneumonia patients in the county are tested for Legionnaires' [disease] as part of the health department's ""very strict physician guidance"" for dealing with the disease, officials said. The bacteria can be found in large plumbing systems, hot tubs, air conditioning units in large buildings and fountains, according to the CDC.""We want everyone to be aware of the signs and symptoms of Legionnaires' disease, which include fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, pneumonia, and sometimes diarrhea and abdominal pain,"" officials said. ""Pontiac fever has similar symptoms but does not progress to pneumonia."" People catch Legionnaires' disease when they breathe mist containing the bacteria or if water ""goes down the wrong pipe"" when they attempt to drink, officials said. The bacteria [do] not usually spread from one person to another.Filtering water does not remove _Legionella_ bacteria, officials said. Flint residents at higher risk of infection, including the elderly, smokers, and people with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems, are urged to drink bottled water. _Legionella_ bacteria have been found in some Flint homes by scientists attempting to identify the source of the city's deadly Legionnaires' disease outbreak in 2014-15.[Byline: Holly Fournier]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion1@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.Genesee County is in the U.S. state of Michigan, with a population was 425 790; the county seat and population center is the city of Flint (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesee_County,_Michigan>).When last reported by ProMED-mail (Legionellosis - USA (02): (MI) fatal, nosocomial, 2014-15, RFI), there was a total of 91 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease diagnosed from June 2014 through October 2015, with 12 deaths in the city of Flint, Michigan, when only 12 cases would have been expected to have occurred during this period. A time line of Legionnaires' disease cases in Genesee County from 2010 to 2015 can be found at: <http://www.waterandhealth.org/legionella-flints-drinking-water/>. 50 of the 91 cases were hospitalized in the 2 weeks before they got sick at the McLaren Flint hospital that is served by the City of Flint municipal water system. The incubation period for Legionnaires' diseases is 2 to 10 days after exposure, which implicates exposure to a water source in the hospital for their illness.The increase in cases of Legionnaires' disease in Flint happened after Flint switched its water source in April 2014 from the city of Detroit's water supply to the Flint River, which runs through the city of Flint. Flint switched back to Detroit water in October 2015. The Flint River water was said to be highly corrosive. Failure to use anti-corrosive treatment on the Flint River water is believed to have led to higher iron, as well as lead, levels in the water after April 2014, according to researchers from Virginia Tech (<http://flintwaterstudy.org/about-page/about-us/>). Dissolved iron turned the water the color of rust, and free chlorine, which had been added at the treatment plant to help destroy pathogens, was depleted by its interaction with iron pipe. _Legionella_ require the presence of iron to grow. The dissolved iron in the water and lower chlorine levels supported the growth of _Legionella_.Genotyping of patients and environmental _Legionella_ isolates could have established a definitive link between Flint's water and Legionnaires' disease. However, comparing the genotype of _Legionella_ DNA in patients and _Legionella_ DNA isolated from the city's drinking water was reportedly not undertaken during the outbreak (<http://www.waterandhealth.org/legionella-flints-drinking-water/>).There were 6-8 cases of Legionnaires' disease per year in the years 2010 to 2013 (<http://www.waterandhealth.org/legionella-flints-drinking-water/>); about twice that number of cases have occurred so far this year (2016). It would be important to know whether these cases in 2016 continue to be linked to increased levels of _Legionella_ in Flint's water supply. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources in regards to levels of _Legionella_ in Flint's water supply and whether the species and genotypes of _Legionella_ in the water match those of the clinical isolates. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
