Since the diagnosis of the 1st human case of CCHF in 1976, sporadic cases have been reported from different regions across Pakistan. Between 2011-2015 over 300 CCHF cases were confirmed in the country. Balochistan, however, remains the most affected province with over 50 per cent of the total cases (<http://nih.org.pk/files/Newsletter/Seasoanl%20Awareness%20and%20Alert%20Letter%20(SAAL)%2036th%20Issue.pdf>).The report above pertains to identification of 3 cases of CCHF currently under treatment in a local hospital of the provincial capital, Quetta. 2 new cases have been identified as residents of Loralai district in the north-east of Balochistan province in Pakistan.In order to limit the morbidity and mortality due to CCHF, prevention and control efforts should focus on reducing the risk of tick-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-human contact transmission in the community through awareness campaigns, use of protective clothing, acaricides and repellents, quarantine of animals and their pre-treatment with pesticide and ensuring implementation of infection prevention and control programs at the health facilities to check nosocomial spread of the virus (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/>). - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1299>.]
