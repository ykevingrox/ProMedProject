Daily Times[edited]<http://dailytimes.com.pk/sindh/22-Aug-16/kmc-declares-emergency-in-city>The authorities of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) have issued Congo [Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, CCHF] emergency in the city and have assigned teams to check the sacrificial animals coming from other districts of Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan for the presence of Congo virus, Daily Times learnt on [Sun 21 Aug 2016].After the death of Bahawalpur's animal trader due to CCHF in Karachi last week [week of 15 Aug 2016], authorities have finally taken notice. On [Sun 21 Aug 2016], through a letter, teams of veterinary doctors were constituted to examine the animals at cattle market. The animal trader is said to get affected by the virus in the Karachi cattle market.In a letter written by Karachi Commissioner to Karachi Metropolitan Corporation administrator, it was asked to constitute teams of veterinary doctors of KMC to examine these animals at the cattle market and direct the officers concerned to make immediate arrangements to keep them away from the other animals/cattle to prevent any untoward situation. However, in the letter, the commissioner has not mentioned what exactly the teams would be doing with the animals at the cattle market.According to Dr Zafar Mehdi, focal person on the government facility for prevention of _Naegleria_ and CCHF, a 22-year-old man from Bahawalpur had brought sacrificial animals in the city to sell ahead of Eidul Azha [or Eid al-Adha, Festival of the Sacrifice] died at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) after being inflicted with the Congo fever, taking the toll of victims of the disease in the city to 4 this year [2016].The trader's death alarmed the local authorities to make sure that the hundreds of thousands of animals, already brought to the animal market off the Superhighway, were safe from the tick that transfers the lethal disease to humans.CCHF is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia. The virus is a member of the _Bunyaviridae_ family of RNA viruses.The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.Health experts have warned that Congo viral disease might take epidemic proportions in coming weeks as tens of thousands sacrificial animals would enter Karachi ahead of Eidul Azha [13 Sep 2016]. They have asked authorities concerned to devise a strategy for screening and vaccination of animals.""The sale of animals is less regulated; there is an increased movement of animals from endemic areas to urban centres, as purchases are made both from cattle markets and local vendors who bring animals from rural areas to commercial and residential areas of cities,"" said Dr Farhana Azim, Public Health Consultant and Member Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI)'s Diagnostic Committee.""Hence, it is common for families to purchase cattle, a goat, or a sheep several weeks in advance of Eid, to maintain the animal for sacrifice on Eid. This leads to an increased exposure of the general public to viremic animals,"" she added.Another public health expert, Dr Suleman Otho, has asked the agricultural workers and others working with animals to use insect repellent on exposed skin and clothing. It was important for healthcare workers to use proper infection control precautions to prevent occupational exposure, he added.""Insect repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are the most effective in warding off ticks. Wearing gloves and other protective clothing is recommended. Individuals should also avoid contact with the blood and body fluids of livestock or humans who show symptoms of infection,"" he added.According to Dr Otho, an inactivated, mouse-brain derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and is used on a small scale in Eastern Europe. However, there is no safe and effective vaccine currently available for human use.""Further research is needed to develop these potential vaccines as well as determine the efficacy of different treatment options including ribavirin and other antiviral drugs,"" he added.[Byline: Zulfiqar Kunbhar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Gujarat: fatal caseDate: Tue 23 Aug 2016Source: The News International [edited]<https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/144662-Congo-Virus-patient-dies-in-Rawalpindi>A young patient, diagnosed with Congo virus [Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever], died [Tue 23 Aug 2016] in a local hospital [in Rawalpindi] after having remained admitted therein for 4 days.Sources said that the victim, aged 35, was a resident of Gujarat and was shifted to Rawalpindi on [19 Aug 2016].He was under treatment in Fouji Foundation Hospital, Gujarat where he was diagnosed with Congo virus.

The CDG has cautioned health, livestock, and other departments to remain on red alert to meet emergency situation regarding Congo virus. The CDG has ordered immediate shifting of all cattle-sheds from urban areas to outside, officials said. The CDG has imposed Section 144 and ban the selling of animal skins in urban areas to prevent spread of Congo virus.The CDG has planned establishing 6 sacrificial animal markets outside the urban area to prevent possible spread of Congo virus. The screening of animals and anti-Congo sprays would be conducted on a daily basis at all sacrificial animal markets. The screening camps are established at entry and exit points of the city and no animal would be allowed to enter without anti-Congo spray. The sellers would be provided special stickers after spray as Congo free clearance. Meanwhile, speaking at a Congo prevention meeting [in Multan], DCO Nadir Chattha ordered the respective officers to take stringent measures to [control the disease]. He ordered the provision of gloves, masks, and special kits to buyers who come to purchase sacrificial animals in the markets.The CDG has advised the citizens to wear gloves and masks when visiting sacrificial animal markets and to prevent children from playing with animals. Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia. The virus belongs to a group called _Nairovirus_ and infects wild as well as domestic animals like sheep and cattle through tick bites. Humans are infected when they come in direct contact with blood or tissues from infected animals or bites of infected ticks. The people who work in close contact with livestock, such as those working in agriculture, slaughterhouses, and veterinary hospitals, are at a higher risk of acquiring the disease. Once a human is affected, the infection spreads to other people if they come in contact with the patient's infected blood or body fluids. The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease that spreads through tick bites. The disease is more common in Africa, Asia, East Europe, and the Middle East.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Balochistan: fatal case countDate: Tue 23 Aug 2016Source: Pak Observer [edited]<http://pakobserver.net/9-killed-by-congo-virus-in-quetta/>At least 9 people have died so far from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Quetta.
