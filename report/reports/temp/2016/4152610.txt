Skowronski <danuta.skowronski@bccdc.ca>, Gaston De Serres <Gaston.DeSerres@inspq.qc.ca> [edited]In the [10 April 2016] ProMED posting (archive no. 20160410.4146702), influenza is cited as a major explanation for surge in the overall UK death toll in 2015 compared to 2014, described as the greatest percentage increase since 1968. The 2014-2015 seasons' influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), below 50 percent against the dominant and antigenically-drifted A(H3N2) epidemic strain, is suggested as a potential contributing factor.While mortality was higher in the UK in 2014-2015 compared to previous seasons, with an excess occurring primarily in January and February 2015 when A(H3N2) was most prevalent [ref 1], VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the UK in 2014-15 was 29 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 9 to 45 percent) [ref 2], which is not much different from that of other recent seasons in the UK for which an A(H3N2)-specific VE could be measured including 2012-2013 (26 percent; 95 percent CI: -4 to 48 percent) [ref 3] and 2011-2012 (23 percent; 95 percent CI: -10 to 47 percent) [ref 4].A VE below 50 percent is unfortunately not exceptional for the A(H3N2) subtype. In a meta-analysis published last week in Lancet Infectious Diseases, Belongia et al. reported a pooled average VE of just 33 percent (95 percent CI: 26 to 39 percent) against A(H3N2) illness based on 34 studies using the test-negative design (TND) since 2007-08 [refs 5,6]. Although lower than the average VE estimate for A(H1N1)pdm09 (61 percent) or influenza B (54 percent), this VE estimate for A(H3N2) did not substantially differ between working age adults (35 percent) or the elderly (24 percent), or between seasons of vaccine match (33 percent) or mismatch (23 percent). In fact, the pooled VE for A(H3N2) never exceeded 50 percent during any season since 2010-11 [ref 5].The 2014-2015 influenza season was not only distinguished by an epidemic of antigenically-drifted A(H3N2) virus, but also by the use of A(H3N2) vaccine that was identical to 2013-14, and that was also antigenically similar to the vaccine [used]in 2012-2013 [ref 7]. Previous modeling simulations by Smith et al. suggested that negative effects from prior vaccination could be pronounced under such conditions [ref 8]. To explore this set of ""perfect storm"" conditions in explaining observations for 2014-2015, the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) has recently published VE estimates for 2014-2015 stratified by prior vaccination history [refs 7,9]. The overall adjusted VE against A(H3N2) was -17 percent (95 percent CI: -50 to 9 percent) -- the lowest measured in a decade in Canada.Patients vaccinated in 2014-2015 but not the prior season, experienced moderate protection with significant VE of 53 percent (95 percent CI: 10 to 75 percent), despite antigenic drift and vaccine mismatch. However, VE was significantly lower at -32 percent (95 percent CI: -75 to 0 percent) among patients vaccinated in both 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Furthermore, among patients serially vaccinated each year since 2012-2013, VE was -54 percent (95 percentCI: -108 to -14 percent), suggesting that habitual vaccination was associated with significant 1.54 times (54 percent) higher risk of medically-attended A(H3N2) illness in 2014-2015 compared to those who had remained consistently unvaccinated.Each of the above VE findings is based on the TND -- a form of case-control study --, that, like any observational design, requires careful consideration of potential bias and confounding in interpreting results. Nevertheless, as illustrated by UK mortality statistics for 2014-2015, A(H3N2) epidemics are associated with substantial disease burden. In that context, recent publications that indicate recurrently low VE [ref 5] and that further signal the possibility that repeat vaccination may contribute to A(H3N2) vulnerability [ref 7], require serious reflection and urgent resolution.References----------1.
