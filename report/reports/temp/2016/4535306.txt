MaliActu, Le Combat report [in French, trans. Mod.BM, edited]<http://maliactu.net/mali-maladie-de-ver-de-guinee-3-cas-confirmes-et-un-autre-suspect-chez-le-chien/>The National Centre for Information, Education and Communication for Health (CNIECS) collaborates with Kyne consulting. Kyne consulting specializes in public health communication and will help the CNIECS to develop key messages to raise awareness about Guinea worm disease.Mali remains one of the 4 countries still affected by Guinea worm disease [dracunculiasis]. This is why public health authorities increase each year efforts to eradicate it.To date, encouraging results have been obtained. According to figures published by the CNIECS, the number of cases of Guinea worm cases decreased from 16 024 in 1992 to only 5 cases in 2015 (a reduction rate of 99.96 per cent); the number of affected villages has decreased from 11 063 in 1992 to only 3 in 2015 (a reduction rate of 99.74 percent).These results were obtained through medical management of patients, drilling of boreholes in endemic villages, and public awareness through intense national media campaigns.However, the objective of the national eradication program of this disease will not be reached this year [2016], since according to CNIECS, in September 2016 3 cases were confirmed in the Tominian Health District and a 4th case in a dog is being analyzed at the CDC in Atlanta, USA.The detection of the human form of Guinea worm disease in animals makes emphasizes that Mali, following the example of the other countries affected, must strengthen and adapt the communication of its national programs for disease eradication. It is in this perspective that the Carter Center, the main financial partner of the programs for eradication of Guinea worm, committed the US consulting firm Kyne to help the country in the light of the new situation.To this end, a meeting was held in Hawa Keita Centre, where stakeholders in the eradication of the Guinea worm disease and the representative of Kyne, Ammer Shaheed, assessed the current communications and reviewed proposals from the consulting company. According to Ameer Shaheed, ""we are at a very crucial time when Guinea worm is about to be eradicated; hence, all measures are needed to find the last pockets of resistance."" This is, in his words, the importance of communicating about the eradication program by distributing special messages.""[Byline: Mohamed Dagnoko]--Communicated by:ProMED-FRA<promed-fra@promedmail.org>[The Guinea worm (_Dracunculus medinensis_) eradication program in Mali has been very successful as indicated by the numbers cited above.The discovery that dogs may serve as reservoir for _D. medinensis_ (see our comments in the posting Guinea worm - Chad: reservoir in dogs 20160815.4417513) is a concern because it may constitute a reservoir from which the infection can again be reintroduced into humans. - Mods.BM/EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/50>.]
