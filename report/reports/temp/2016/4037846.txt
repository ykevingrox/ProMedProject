News Ghana [edited]<http://www.newsghana.com.gh/lassa-fever-kills-23-in-benin/>""From 21 Jan - 13 Feb [2016], 68 cases have been recorded and 23 deaths reported,"" public health national director Yorou Chabi Orou Bagou told Xinhua.Benin health authorities were alerted in January [2016] when a pregnant woman showed signs of the disease died at Tchaourou' St Martin de Papane hospital. In addition, 6 health workers were [documented as having] similar symptoms in the same hospital-center, located in the north eastern part of the country.Faced with the scale of the epidemic, the government of Benin has stepped up emergency measures. These include the setting up of quarantine units in affected areas for isolation and care provision to victims, the establishment of a tracing system to find people exposed to the disease and the mobilization of about 200 health workers throughout the country.Further, [the antiviral medication] ribavirin, considered effective against the disease, is being made available in affected regions in Benin and Cotonou, the capital city of the West African country. --communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmai.org>[The number of Lassa fever cases has gone from 25 suspected and 4 confirmed with 8 deaths on 5 Feb 2016 to 68 cases and 23 deaths, as reported above. The apparent Lassa virus infection of 6 health workers is of concern.  Unfortunately, transmission of the virus to health workers in hospitals is common.  Since the virus is endemic in Benin and cases have occurred there in previous years, one hopes that the emergency response measures will continue into the future, when new cases will doubtless appear, after the current outbreak has ended.The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp). Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Benin can be accessed at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/benin/beu51k8n/benin_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22157>. - Mod.TY]
