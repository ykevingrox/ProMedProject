Pakistan Observer [edited]<http://pakobserver.net/2016/03/10/karachi-quetta-polio-virus-reservoirs/>Minister of State for National Health Services Saira made a startling revelation in the Senate on Wednesday [9 Mar 2016] while responding to the queries of the members when she said that Karachi [Sindh province], Quetta [Balochistan province] and Peshawar [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] are the main reservoirs of the crippling polio virus.The disclosure stunned the lawmakers but the Minister was adamant that she has the requisite statistics and data to prove her point. ""Technical Advisory Group established to review situation of poliomyelitis has also stated that the 3 cities including Karachi are reservoirs of polio virus,"" she said adding the primary reasons of the spread of the virus is the movement of population in these cities. Saira Afzal Tarar regretted that Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 countries where the crippling virus still exists.The 1st case of polio for the current year was reported in Karachi while 2 of the total 5 cases registered so far in the country hail from Peshawar. The Minister, however, said the federal and provincial governments are giving the eradication of polio as the foremost priority and the same is visible from marked reduction in the cases of polio.The Minister said though the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government was running one day polio campaign which was not sufficient to cover all the children under the age of 5 years but now more practical approach has been adopted by the provincial government to rid the area under its jurisdiction of the crippling virus.[Byline: Zahid Chaudhary]--Communicated by: ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Quetta is in Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh, and Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Each of the cities is the capital city of its province and the major urban center of the province.A map showing the locations of these provinces and cities can be found at: <http://www.bizbilla.com/country-maps/pakistan.html>.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Pakistan can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Pakistan: new case, Sindh - media reportDate: Fri 11 Mar 2016Source: Pakistan Today [edited]<http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/03/11/city/karachi/another-polio-case-reported-in-jacobabad/>Another polio case reported in Jacobabad----------------------------------------Another polio case in a child surfaced in Jacobabad on Thursday [10 Mar 2016], taking the number of polio virus [paralytic polio cases] in Sindh to 2 during the current year [2016].According to health department sources, a minor was brought to a hospital where he was diagnosed with polio virus positive after testing his blood sample. On the other hand, an anti-polio campaign is underway in different parts of Sindh to vaccinate polio drops to the children.It may be added that the virus was tested positive in a 34-month-old baby in Karachi. Meanwhile, Karachi Commissioner Asif Hyder Shah on Thursday [10 Mar 2016] claimed that polio vaccine refusal cases had declined by 70 per cent in Karachi and efforts were underway to further improve vaccination coverage in the city by coordination with religious scholars.The commissioner had stated this during media briefing on polio at Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) Sindh Office. Emergency Coordinator Dr Muhammad Usman Chachar, Begum Shahnaz Wazir Ali and others officials were also present on this occasion. Asif Hyder Shah informed that polio refusals cases had been significantly declined from 40 000 to 14 000 in Karachi and further efforts were underway to achieve the target with the help of religious scholars.He said Pakistan was near to eradicating polio from the country and 3 upcoming polio drives would play a major role in eradication of this crippling disease from the country.He said eradication of polio virus from Pakistan was not possible without Karachi. He said the overall security situation had been improved in the city in the last 2 years. The security too had been beefed up for the protection of polio workers, he added.He further informed that 6 polio cases had been reported throughout the country in 2016 out of which 2 were reported from Sindh province. He said a 3-day polio drive would start from [14 Mar 2016] in the city where about 2.2 million would be administrated polio drops.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is unclear from the above media report if full laboratory testing results were available to confirm this case as a wild poliovirus (WPV) associated case of paralysis. Given the high volumes of polio cases seen in the country over the past years combined with the massive efforts made towards polio eradication, one presumes that clinicians are able to diagnose cases of suspected polio. What cannot be diagnosed on pure clinical grounds is whether AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases are due to infection with a WPV, a cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus), or not due to poliovirus infection.The media report lauds the reduction in vaccine refusals during vaccination campaigns, with a 70% reduction -- from 40 000 to 14 000 -- an admirable reduction. An accomplishment, as well as the increased security for vaccination workers. All evidence of the major political commitment to polio eradication. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Global Polio Eradication InitiativeDate: Thu 10 Mar 2016Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>Polio eradication this week (as of 9 Mar 2016):Wild poliovirus type 1 and Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases:Total cases: YTD*-2016: WPV** / cVDPV*** // YTD*-2015: WPV** / cVDPV*** // Total in 2015: WPV** / cVDPV***Globally: 6 / 3 // 17 / 1 // 74 / 32- in endemic countries: 6 / 0 // 17 / 1 // 74 / 3- in non-endemic countries: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 29* YTD - year to date** WPV - wild poliovirus*** cVDPV - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirusCase breakdown by country:Countries: YTD-2016: WPV / cVDPV // YTD-2015: WPV / cVDPV // Total 2015: WPV / cVDPV // Onset paralysis most recent case: WPV / CVDPVAfghanistan: 1 / 0 // 1 / 0 // 20 / 0 // 1 Feb 2016 / NAPakistan: 5 / 0 // 16 / 1 // 54 / 2 // 12 Feb 2016 / 9 Feb 2015Guinea: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 7 // NA / 14 Dec 2015Lao PDR: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 8 // NA / 11 Jan 2016 Madagascar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 10 // NA / 22 Aug 2015Myanmar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 5 Oct 2015Nigeria: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 1 // NA / 16 May 2015Ukraine: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 7 Jul 2015NA: onset of paralysis in most recent case is prior to 2014.
