KOMO News [edited]<http://komonews.com/news/local/e-coli-infections-prompt-temporary-closure-of-monroe-preschool>A school in Monroe has closed after 2 young girls there were hospitalized with a serious _E. coli_ infection, the Snohomish County Health District reports. The girls, both under 5, attended the preschool at the Monroe Montessori School on Village Way. Heath officials decided to close the entire school as a precaution and will be contacting the 60 students and 10 staff members who went there after 11 Jul 2016. The 2 children were hospitalized due to complications from a Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ infection. One has developed a serious kidney disease [probably hemolytic-uremic syndrome].Health department stressed that the school is not the source of the _E. coli_ infection. It was likely brought into the school by a student who may have come in contact with fecally contaminated material from a nearby farm. ""The exact source of contamination in _E. coli_ can be very difficult to identify, but at this point we believe the children were likely exposed to livestock near their home,"" said Dr. Gary Goldbaum, health officer and director of the health district. ""The school has been cooperating fully as we work with the families and improve existing policies and procedures to prevent these incidents from happening in the future.""About 60 other preschoolers and staff members were potentially exposed, and health officials are working with the school and the Department of Early Learning to get them all tested.The symptoms of this _E. coli_ infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting and possible fever. Most people get better within a week as infections can be mild, but others can be severe or even life-threatening, health officials said. Young children and the elderly are more likely to experience serious illness.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The serotype of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is not stated.
