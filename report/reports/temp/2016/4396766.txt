SBS [edited]<http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/08/04/our-fruit-safe-rockmelon-farmers>Rockmelon growers in northern Australia are pleading with shoppers to buy their produce despite a widening salmonellosis outbreak linked to the fruit. 11 more cases of salmonellosis were identified by NSW Health on Thu 4 Aug 2016, taking the overall figure to 97 in the past 7 weeks. None of the cases have been fatal.Katherine-based company Red Dirt Melons has taken its rockmelons off the shelves after the company's fruit tested positive for the _Salmonella [enterica serotype]_ Hvittingfoss bacterium. 49 of the reported cases were in NSW between 14 Jun 2016 and 1 Aug 2016, with almost half of those involving children under 5, according to NSW Health. Authorities are still unsure of the outbreak's origin, but melon farmers insist it's safe to eat rockmelons bought after 2 Aug 2016.The Australian Melon Association says a drop in sales has affected about a dozen family farms, ""from Kununurra in Western Australia to northern Queensland,"" who grow the fruit in winter.NSW Health is working closely with the NSW Food Authority to determine the origin of the contamination but says consumption of the fruit has been the common factor among patients. ""Anyone who is unsure of the origin of any rockmelon that comes into their possession should not eat the product,"" NSW Health director of health protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty said in a statement.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The rockmelon, _Cucumis melo reticulatus_, with sweet orange flesh and a rough skin resembling netting, is called cantaloupe in the USA; see image at: <http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Primary_Industry/Content/Image/horticulture/rockmelon_no_background.JPG>.The following paragraphs were extracted from the MMWR summary of the _Salmonella_ Poona outbreak cited in the see alsos (20021123.5884):""Salmonella infections have been linked to melons at least since 1990, when _S. enterica_ serotype Chester traced to cantaloupe caused 245 illnesses in 30 states. The cantaloupe were imported from either Mexico or Guatemala. In 1991, an outbreak of cantaloupe-associated serotype Poona infections caused 400 illnesses in 23 states. Illness was associated with eating pre-cut cantaloupe in fruit salads or from salad bars. Although industry sources identified the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas as the probable source of the implicated cantaloupe, some might have come from Mexico. In response to this outbreak, FDA conducted a microbiologic survey that isolated a variety of _Salmonella_ serotypes from approximately 1 percent of sampled imported cantaloupe and watermelon. In 1997, an outbreak of serotype Saphra infections affected 25 persons in California. Illness was associated with cantaloupe imported from Mexico. After the 2000 and 2001 serotype Poona outbreaks, FDA conducted farm investigations in Mexico, issued press releases to warn consumers, placed implicated farms on detention, and conducted sampling surveys of imported cantaloupe. The 1999 and 2000 FDA surveys of imported produce indicated that 5 percent of cantaloupe sampled (8 of 151) was contaminated with Salmonella.FDA provides information about the decontamination of melons to the retail industry, food-service establishments, and commercial processors of pre-cut melon. The use of sodium hypochlorite or other permitted antimicrobials in combination with brushing is recommended. The potential for microbial contamination also might be reduced by using only good-quality fruit that is free from open wounds or defects that might allow bacteria to contaminate the interior of the fruit. Additional research is needed to determine the effectiveness of consumer produce-washing practices. Consumers should be sure that fresh-cut melons are refrigerated or surrounded by ice; leftover cut melons should be discarded if left at room temperature for more than 2 hours."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/284>.]
