News10 ABC [edited]<http://news10.com/2016/11/03/ny-dept-of-health-investigating-15-cases-of-legionnaires-disease/>Two weeks ago [October 2016], it started as just 4 cases of legionnaires' disease in Saratoga Springs. The New York State Department of Health [NYS DOH] now confirms they are investigating 15 cases, including 2 deaths.The NYS DOH confirms 9 of the cases are associated with the Wesley Health Care Center, including both fatalities.Test results released Thursday [3 Nov 2016] of about 3 dozen water samples taken last month [October 2016] found that while the majority of samples tested negative, there were 5 positive tests, including 1 from the outdoor landscaped water feature. Wesley Health Center says 3 of the 4 remaining positive test results were limited to the Hathorn building and Springs building.The Health Care Center says it is taking this matter very seriously and places great value on the care of its residents and staff. Wesley says it is working with the New York State Department of Health and Saratoga County Public Health Department.It is also working with a water treatment company and [closely] evaluating a monochloromine system, which purifies and cleans the center's water. The facility has implemented a water restriction plan and is still awaiting test results.A group formed after the deadly legionnaires' outbreaks in the Bronx [New York City] last year [2015] says health officials are ignoring the likely source: drinking water supply. ""For health care, they are required to test, per NYS state law, the water supply,"" said Daryn Cline.NYS DOH says they are investigating 6 additional cases, but could not name any potential sources. One woman diagnosed with the disease said earlier this week, she may have contracted it from Saratoga Hospital.News10 ABC is told they are still not testing for the bacteria. Cline says they are required to test for it and says, ""It's bizarre that they aren't.""In regards to the 6 additional cases not associated with Wesley, the state health department says a mucus sample is required to potentially find an environmental source, but they say it can be difficult and they are often not able to definitively determine the source of _Legionella_.[Byline: Rachel Yonkunas]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail via HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[We thank Jack Guzewich, an EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member, and Denis Green for submitting similar reports.The above news report says that 5 water samples were positive for _Legionella_; 1 was from an outdoor landscaped water feature, but the news report does not identify the source for the other 4 positive samples. The usual source for outbreaks of legionnaires' disease is a contaminated cooling tower, but potable water contaminated with _Legionella_ is another potential source of infection for patients in healthcare facilities who may be prone to aspirate. Wesley is said to have ""transitioned from using drink stations to bottled waters and juices, and are using only bagged ice as needed.""The last paragraph is confusing. Legionnaires' disease can be diagnosed by detecting _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen in the patient's urine or by culturing _Legionella_ from a sputum sample. I presume what is meant by ""mucus sample"" is sputum. A sputum sample is required in order to culture _Legionella_ from a patient with legionnaires' disease. An isolate is required for genotyping. If the genotypes of the sputum and environmental isolates match, the environmental source would be responsible for that patient's infection. If a contaminated cooling tower is found to be the source for the 9 Wesley residents, aerosols generated from this cooling tower can travel for a distance downwind from the cooling tower, so that the other 6 infected individuals not directly associated with Wesley might nevertheless be infected by a Wesley cooling tower. For example, in the 1976 outbreak in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, most cases of legionnaires' disease were at a convention held at a particular downtown hotel, but some patients, called at the time ""Broad Street"" pneumonia cases, were only passersby within the vicinity of the hotel (<https://www.nap.edu/read/4795/chapter/32#437>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.]
