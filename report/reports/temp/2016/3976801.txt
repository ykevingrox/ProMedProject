The Times of India, Times News Network (TNN) [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Beware-of-brain-eating-bug/articleshow/50752696.cms>A fatal microbe that invades the body through the nose and travels through nerve fibres into brain where its feeds on cerebral tissues could be active in Kolkata [the capital of West Bengal state]. Even though extremely rare -- with less than 150 cases recorded worldwide since 1965 -- primary amoebic meningoencephalitis or PAM struck a 14-year-old boy in Kolkata earlier this month [January 2016].Doctors suspect he contracted the [amoeba] while swimming and have warned that pools and other fresh water bodies in the city may be harbouring the [amoeba] which has the macabre name 'brain-eating amoeba'.The mortality rate for PAM is a staggering 98 percent but the boy survived. It was touch and go for 3 weeks because his kidneys were also badly affected, but a team of doctors at CMRI [Calcutta Medical Research Institute] Hospital refused to give up on him and tried out-of-the-box techniques which pulled him back from the brink. He is extremely lucky to be alive, said one of the doctors, adding that they had to seek a rare drug with the help of the state health department to save the boy. It is only the 5th known PAM survival in India.""The principal drug -- amphotericin B -- is very toxic. It was used along with 3 other drugs but the child suffered kidney failure, a common side effect. Then, we had to act very fast. The principal drug was discontinued and we decided to try 3 other drugs that have been used in recent PAM cases elsewhere. One of these was [miltefosine], a new drug not yet widely available in the market but very effective,"" said Sushmita Banerjee, paediatric nephrologist at CMRI.The health department was approached for the drug and the directorate of health procured it quickly.After 2 weeks of being used in combination, the cocktail of medicines managed to control the infection. His kidneys stabilized and other symptoms like headache and vomiting gradually receded. By the end of the 3rd week, he was declared fit to leave the hospital.""Initially, it seemed like meningitis. But we were worried when the lumbar puncture report indicated that his cell counts and the CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] protein count were worryingly high,"" recalled Banerjee.The doctors were surprised by the findings and spoke with family members to find out more about the boy. The feedback revealed that the youngster was a regular swimmer. This prompted doctors to dig deeper and ask for a test to detect PAM.A rare kind of meningitis associated with swimming in fresh water lakes, rivers, and pools, it is a devastating infection caused by a free-living microscopic amoeba called _Naegleria fowleri_. It enters the body through the nose, makes its way to the brain, and causes PAM. In the brain, it feeds on nerve tissues and multiplies, causing necrosis and bleeding. Cases of PAM are extremely few and research on the infection is also rare, said a doctor.In USA, only 135 cases have been recorded in the last 2 decades -- of whom merely 4 survived.in India, 4 cases of survival have been reported.According to a tropical medicine expert, swimming pools are the principal source of the infection. ""While PAM could be triggered by either an amoeba or protozoa, usually pools are the source. It could be risky to use a pool that has not been properly chlorinated,"" he said.But PAM could even spread through other sources of water, said Indranil Ray, consultant microbiologist, CMRI, who was a part of the team treating the youngster. ""When we checked recent cases, we found that it had even affected people who never swam in a pool. But pools and ponds remain the principal sources. We have also observed that patients in India, including this one, were probably struck by a less virulent strain. In the West, the common strain is more aggressive and hence more fatal,"" explained Ray.[Byline: Prithvijit Mitra]--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by the free-living amoeba _Naegleria fowleri_. The amoeba is commonly found in warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs and soil. During swimming or diving in water bodies or inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or use of heated and contaminated tap water the amoeba enters human body through nose and reached the brain causing fatal meningoencephalitis. Symptoms start after an incubation period of 1-9 days and progresses rapidly towards death around 1-18 days after symptom onset. Initial symptoms include severe frontal headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting followed by stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations, and coma. There have been 4 known survivors in North America. In 2013, 2 children survived PAM in USA, both were treated with miltefosine, a broad spectrum antimicrobial drug (<http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/illness.html>). There is no vaccine against _Naegleria fowleri_.A 14-year-old boy in Kolkata is reported to have survived PAM in January 2016. It is suggested that the patient may have acquired the infection in an inadequately chlorinated swimming pool. In addition to the principal drug amphotericin B, he was treated with 3 other drugs including miltefosine. Amphotericin B, however, was discontinued due to side effects. According to the news report, this is the 5th surviving case of PAM in India. Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2384>. - Mod.SNThe discussion in the text of more or less virulent strains of _Naegleria fowleri_ is entirely conjectural. There are no data to support this. The report of survival is intriguing as all cases in the United States had a fatal outcome. It is important to ensure that the diagnosis is correct, which is best done by a specific PCR. It is interesting that the patient was treated with miltefosine.A previous report (Cope JR et a: Use of the novel therapeutic agent miltefosine for the treatment of primary amebic meningoencephalitis: report of 1 fatal and 1 surviving case. Clin Infect Dis. 2015. pii: civ1021. [Epub ahead of print]) reported the use of miltefosine, but further data are needed.A study of water samples from Northern India found free living amoeba in 40 percent, 37/43 was positive for _Naegleria_, but only one was typed as _Naegleria fowleri_. - Mod.EP]
