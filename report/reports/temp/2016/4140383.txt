Like many a Brit he travelled awhile but latterly had settled in Dallas with MEMS Development at Texas Instruments. There he was responsible for two patents: Methods and systems for laser assisted wirebonding in 2009 and Piezoelectric resonator with an efficient all-dielectric Bragg reflector in 2008. But his unique insight into the true nature of the anthrax spores in the 2001 letters set him apart.In a 24 Mar 2010 Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (04) 20100324.0933 posting he spelt out the key questions concerning the spores used in the letters. I was the moderator for that communication. He saw what everyone else had missed, evidence for microencapsulation. Together with myself and Barbara Rosenberg we came up with clear proof of the microencapsulation, a paper that would have been impossible without him. [17 Oct 2011 Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (08): spore characteristics 20111017.3112 , and <http://www.omicsonline.org/2157-2526/2157-2526-S3-001.pdf>]. There were outstanding questions which we dealt with in a second joint paper where we demonstrated that the raised silicon levels in some test surrogate spore preparations were but the result of spore production procedures, as was the extraordinary appearance of aluminum [see 26 Jan 2013 Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA: spore characteristics 20130125.1514939 , and <http://www.omicsonline.org/2157-2526/2157-2526-S3-008.pdf>] After which we have had not a whisper of criticism that the spores were microencapsulated. And it was thanks to Stuart's initial special insight.On 24 Feb 2016, Stuart passed away suddenly, of a heart attack. He was only 56 years old. His oldest son Christopher, found him at his desk. He was hoping to retire from Texas Instruments in a few years and was in the process of starting his own solar panel company. Our sympathy goes out to his children and Laura his wife. And Barbara & I lost a great colleague. - Mod.MHJ[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.][See Also:2013 -----Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA: spore characteristics 20130125.15149392011 ----Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (08): spore characteristics 20111017.3112Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (07) 20111010.3034Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (03): more questions 20110521.15452010 ----Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (04) 20100324.0933].................................................mhj/ao/lm"
