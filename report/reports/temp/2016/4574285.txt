Daily Star [edited]<http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/554654/Deadly-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-virus-strikes-Menorca-resort-Spain>A deadly virus at a 4-star hotel wrecked the holidays of Brit families at a popular tourist hotspot.Up to 17 people have contacted lawyers after their Menorca holiday was cut short. [Menorca is one of the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea.]An outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease at the hotel forced some to return home early and others to seek urgent medical treatment.The holidaymakers reported suffering painful spots and sores after the outbreak at their hotel at the Family Life Mar de Menorca resort in Cala Canutells area last month [September 2016].DM, 22, her partner CB, 26, and their daughter B, one, said they were not told before travelling of the ongoing hand, foot and mouth outbreak at the hotel.They booked the holiday through tour operator Thomson.The disease is an infection that causes mouth ulcers and spots on the hands and feet and is particularly common in children under the age of 10.Just a few days into the holiday B developed a fever and a high temperature.In the following days she developed spots on her arms, legs and around her mouth, which later became a full rash.A total of 17 holidaymakers have now instructed law firm Irwin Mitchell to investigate the outbreak at the hotel.Clare Pearson, a personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, representing the 17 holidaymakers, said: ""The hand, foot and mouth disease outbreak at the Family Life Mar De Menorca is obviously extremely concerning as children are more susceptible to the disease and the hotel is advertised as a 'destination well suited to families'.""The people who have contacted us were shocked that they were not informed of the outbreak before they arrived as many of them would not have chosen to stay at the hotel had they known of the problems.""This is of particular concern for some holidaymakers who had young children and were pregnant at the time of their holidays.DM, from Colchester [England, UK], said the soft play area was not very clean, highchairs were not disinfected after being used and the same cleaning equipment was used in all rooms.DM, who took time off work to look after B on their return to the UK, said: ""It was quite frightening for us when B developed a fever and a rash on her legs, arms and mouth and we really had no idea what was wrong.""Thankfully, she is now on the mend but we had all sorts of things running through our minds.""Nobody seemed to care about what had happened to her and we didn't get very much information or assistance from the tour reps or the hotel.""She added: ""The 1st thing we knew about the hand, foot and mouth outbreak was after speaking to other holidaymakers and then a piece of A4 paper went on the wall in reception to advise that it was hand, foot and mouth, but it really wasn't very obvious and some people may never have seen the notice advising of the outbreak at the hotel.""We were told by a nurse at the local hospital we took B to that they had been treating holidaymakers from the hotel with the disease for weeks.""Had we been warned of what had been going on at the hotel we would never have put B at risk.""We hope by taking legal action we will get the answers we are seeking following our ordeal.""A spokesman for Thomson said: ""We were made aware of a small number of cases of the hand, foot and mouth virus at the Family Life Mar de Menorca hotel.""Our resort team were fully briefed to assist guests and proactively displayed information on how to spot and prevent the spread of the illness.""We would like to reassure our customers that their health is our number one priority, and Thomson closely audit all resorts to which we operate to ensure that hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards.""[Byline: Douglas Patient]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The most common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is infection with the coxsackievirus A16. The coxsackievirus belongs to the nonpolio enteroviruses. Other types of enteroviruses also may cause HFMD.Oral ingestion is the main source of coxsackievirus infection and HFMD. The illness spreads by person-to-person contact with an infected person's: nasal secretions or throat discharge, saliva, fluid from blisters, stool, respiratory droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or sneeze.HFMD is most common in children in child care settings because of frequent diaper changes and potty training, and because little children often put their hands in their mouths.Although your child is most contagious with HFMD during the 1st week of the illness, the virus can remain in his or her body for weeks after the signs and symptoms are gone. That means your child still can infect others.[Excerpted from <http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease/basics/causes/con-20032747>]A map of Spain may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40821>. - Mod.LK].................................................sb/lk/je/ml"
