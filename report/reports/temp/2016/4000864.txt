Investigators said there are at least 41 people showing symptoms of the illness, and 19 are confirmed to have the infection. The Estill County Health Department said within those 19 cases, 6 people have been hospitalized, and 3 people are currently still being treated in the hospital. ""Everybody is getting sick from eating at a place up there,"" said Randel Jones, who lives in Irvine.Like many people in Irvine, Jones knows someone who's sick. However, finding out this bug is Salmonella, has this small town searching for a source. ""They don't need to wait until somebody dies from it, they need to get it done now,"" said Jones.The Estill Co. Health Department is working with the State Health Department to find the source of the outbreak. They said they will DNA test the bacteria to determine where it comes from. Those tests will be sent off to the state on Monday, 8 Feb 2016.""All of the 19 positive cases, the 1 thing they do have in common, they had all eaten at the same establishment. But, they had also eaten at other establishments,"" said Kenny Cole, the Environmental Program Director at the Estill County Health Department. The Estill County Health Department would not release the name of the common establishment. They said that all restaurants in town are up to code and safe. The Estill County Judge Executive even encouraged people to eat at local restaurants. Investigators did add that 1 person who tested positive worked in food service, before they felt sick.""We are not going to point fingers, at this point. But, if we need to, we will shut them down in a heartbeat,"" said Estill County Judge Executive Wallace Taylor. That's a solution, some people say needs to happen now. ""They need to name it, and have the health department go in there, and do their job and fix it,"" said Jones.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Clearly being ""up to code"" does not necessarily prevent foodborne illness.
