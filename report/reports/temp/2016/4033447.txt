The Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Congo-fever-case-reported-in-Ahmedabad-district/articleshow/51033864.cms>The state health department is in a tizzy as the deadly Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, commonly known as Congo fever, has once again struck Ahmedabad district [Gujarat state] after a gap of around 3 years. This time a cattle-breeder of Dhandhuka town of Ahmedabad district has fallen prey to the virus. His condition is stated to be stable.The man, 28, developed symptoms like high fever and headache during the last couple of days. As his condition worsened, he was shifted to a city-based private hospital on Tuesday night [16 Feb 2016] where he was kept in an isolation ward under the monitoring of specialists, said district health officer Shilpa Yadav. Civil hospital sources said the man was shifted there on Wednesday night [15 Feb 2016].The patient is a cattle-breeder who earns his livelihood by selling cow milk in Dhandhuka town. Yadav said that special preventive measures are being taken by administering injections to the cattle by which the Congo virus gets transmitted into humans.Following the 1st positive case of CCHF, the health department team has inspected around 10 persons of the patient's family and 40 others in the locality, Yadav said, adding that none of them had developed Congo fever like symptoms. However, blood samples of around 40 persons have been taken to check if they were infected with Congo fever, she said.The entire team of district health officer rushed to Dhandhuka along with epidemic control officers. Yadav said the health department team will monitor the situation in Dhandhuka where doctors and experts will inspect the people twice a day.R N Patel, in-charge animal husbandry officer in Dhandhuka, said as many as 200 cattle were given Ivermectin injections to control the ticks on them. ""Anti-ticks spray was also sprayed on them so that Congo virus does not spread,"" Patel said.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 2nd CCHF case in Gujarat state that ProMED-mail has posted so far this year (2016). There are previous reports of cases in Gujarat from the Kutch district in 2015. It is clear that CCHF virus is fairly widespread in India. Not only does transmission occur from contact with blood and tissues of CCHF virus-infected animals and ticks, but with blood and secretions of infected individual people as well, usually in a hospital setting.The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The tick control efforts mentioned above should help prevent additional CCHV virus transmission among cattle and to humans in that locality. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state, ""Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was initially characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.""The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin, and it has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients, reportedly with some benefit (<http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/>). However, since the patient died so soon after admission, effective use of the drug in the treatment of the case above would not have been possible.A map of the states and territories of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>, and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3708>. - Mod.TY]
