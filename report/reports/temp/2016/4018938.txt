The Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/Villager-dies-of-Congo-fever/articleshow/50956553.cms>A 40-year-old man from Gondal taluka's [local administrative division] Shivrajgadh village [Rajkot district, Gujarat state] has posthumously tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo fever.The victim died on 9 Feb [2016] but his reports confirmed the infection on Thursday [11 Feb 2016].Dr V H Pathak, Chief District Health Officer, Rajkot, said that the man was brought to a private hospital in the city on 7 Feb [2016]. Following symptoms of Congo fever, the samples were sent for lab tests. ""However, the man died while being taken to Ahmedabad on 9 Feb [2016]. As precautionary measures, medical teams have been sent to Shivrajgadh and we have screened close family members of the deceased. However, none of them showed any symptoms of Congo fever. Animal husbandry department is also camping in the village to stop spread of this fever,'' Dr Pathak said.Earlier, on 20 Oct 2015, a 2-year-old boy had died of Congo fever in Jamnagar. [Is this the 22-year-old man reported below in ProMED-mail archive no. 20151102.3760346? - Mod.TY]Congo fever is mostly caused [a virus transmitted] by tick bites.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from Health Map Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report cites another case and there was an additional one or the same one, a 22-year-old man, in the same general locality in October 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151102.3760346). There are previous reports of cases in Gujarat from the Kutch district in 2015 reported on 18 Feb 2015, 29 Mar 2015, and 16 Jul 2015. It is clear that CCHF virus is fairly widespread in India. Not only does transmission occur from contact with blood and tissues of CCHF virus-infected animals and ticks, but with blood and secretions of infected individual people as well, usually in a hospital setting.The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur. The circumstances under which the man in the above report became infected was not specified.The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state, ""Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was initially characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.""The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin, and it has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients, reportedly with some benefit (<http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/>). However, since the patient died so soon after admission, effective use of the drug in the treatment of the case above would not have been possible.A map of the states and territories of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>, and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/302>. - Mod.TY]
