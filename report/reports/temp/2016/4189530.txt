The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/anthrax-patients-improving/article8531217.ece>The 13 tribal people, including a 1-year-old boy and a woman, from Panasapalli village in Hukumpeta mandal [similar to a county] of Visakha Agency [of Andhra Pradesh], who have been admitted to the King George Hospital [KGH, in Visakhapatnam] on [Tue 26 Apr 2016] with cutaneous anthrax, are improving, Superintendent of KGH M Madhusudhana Babu said on [Wed 27 Apr 2016].Another 3 persons from the same village showing symptoms of anthrax will be shifted to KGH on [Thu 28 Apr 2016] DMHO [District Medical and Health Officer] J Sarojini told The Hindu. The cases were clinically confirmed during the tests done at the Microbiology Department of Andhra Medical College. A survey is on in the area to find out if there are more cases of anthrax. ""They are all stable and might be discharged in 4 or 5 days. Since it is cutaneous anthrax, there is no threat to life. There is a problem with pulmonary anthrax,"" Dr Babu said. He was informed that the victims had consumed meat of a dead goat and this must have contained spores of anthrax.The village is under Uppa PHC [Primary Health Centre]. After coming to know of the incidence of anthrax, teams from the district epidemic cell and intensive health education wing were sent to the area to conduct survey and surveillance along with Additional DHMO's team of Paderu and the local PHC staff, Dr Sarojini said. The teams would also look for cases of pulmonary anthrax.Nearly 15 head of cattle died suddenly in that area during the last few weeks, which is likely due to the cattle being infected by anthrax. Spores of anthrax in a dead animal would enter the human body through abrasions on the hands of persons cutting the animal and separating its parts, she explained.This was the 1st incident after 6 years of several cases being reported from one place while one or 2 were reported during the last few years.[Byline: G Narasimha Rao]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Anthrax is regularly seen in cattle in Andhra Pradesh, with outbreaks each year from 2004 through 2012.
