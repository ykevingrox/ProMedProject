(Reference 15 Jul 2016 article, below)15 Jul 2016: Sierra Leone stops mandatory testing of corpses for Ebola<http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/sierra-leone-stops-mandatory-testing-of-corpses-for-ebola/article/470123>[On Fri [15 Jul 2016] Sierra Leone officials said it would stop the mandatory testing of all dead bodies for the Ebola virus, lifting a restriction put in place at the end of an outbreak that claimed thousands of lives.The World Health Organization [WHO] said on [17 Mar 2016] there were no more known cases of the virus in the country, which surfaced in neighboring Guinea before spreading to Sierra Leone in May 2014.Swabs of saliva were ordered to be systematically taken from any recently deceased person from November 2015, as part of a period of heightened surveillance following the successful containment of the virus.However, the director of Sierra Leone's Public Health Emergency Operation Center, Foday Dafae, now says ""Only deaths that meet the criteria set by the Ministry of Health will be investigated and swabbed"", rather than every single corpse.Dafae cautioned ""We still want people to report all deaths so that we can (maintain) surveillance and monitor all infectious diseases, which is a key to prevent any outbreak materializing.""][Dr Foday Dafae said while there will be a significant scaling down of swabbing, they will keep some stand-by capacity. Also he said disease surveillance officers with a team of existing district Ministry of Health staff will determine if a person who died will need to be swabbed.""Only deaths which meet the criteria set out by the Ministry of Health as determined by officers in the districts will be investigated, and a swab will be conducted.""The Director also stressed that deaths meeting Ebola definition will activate a rapid response team to conduct the swabbing, and deaths meeting the Ebola case definition will be strongly recommended to receive safe and dignified burials in order to protect everyone's health, especially close relatives <http://awoko.org/2016/07/14/sierra-leone-newsmandatory-swabbing-of-corpses-is-over-but/>.][It would be helpful to see a list of the symptoms that would call for swabbing to be performed. - Mod.LK]Research-----20 Jul 2016: Ebola infection may provide partial immunity to other filoviruses <http://www.contagionlive.com/news/ebola-infection-may-provide-partial-immunity-to-other-filoviruses>[Citation.Natesan M, Jensen SM, Keasey SL, et al. 22 Jul 2016.

Furthermore, these antibodies can persist for many years [up to 14 years] beyond the onset of infection, according to the results of a study published recently in Clinical and Vaccine Immunology.According to Dr. Natesan, ""Our study suggests that survival from infection caused by one species may impart at least partial immunity to other filoviruses, and specific antibodies are maintained for years after infection. Concurrent detection of antibody responses to multiple antigens from one species using the microarray system may increase accuracy of results, while the inclusion of probes for multiple viral species facilitates a broader, high-throughput, analysis of infection history."" Regarding the broader implications of his team's study results, Dr. Natesan told Contagion, ""The severe shortage of diagnostic assays and medical interventions during the recent Ebola epidemic motivated us to develop a better way to examine immune responses to infection. We envision that the microarray assay may be particularly useful for disease surveillance among human and potential zoonotic populations....""]20 Jul 2016 (EPUB) Ebola Virus Shedding and Transmission: Review of Current Evidence<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/20/infdis.jiw254.abstract>[Citation.Vetter P., Fischer W.A., Schibler M.A., et al.

We performed an extensive PubMed literature review encompassing the period from discovery of Ebola virus, in 1976, until 1 Jun 2016 to evaluate the evidence on modes of Ebola virus shedding and transmission.--Findings.  Ebola virus has been isolated by cell culture from blood, saliva, urine, aqueous humor, semen, and breast milk from infected or convalescent patients. Ebola virus RNA has been noted in the following body fluids days or months after onset of illness: saliva (22 days), conjunctiva/tears (28 days), stool (29 days), vaginal fluid (33 days), sweat (44 days), urine (64 days), amniotic fluid (38 days), aqueous humor (101 days), cerebrospinal fluid (9 months), breast milk (16 months [preliminary data]), and semen (18 months). Nevertheless, the only documented cases of secondary transmission from recovered patients have been through sexual transmission. We did not find strong evidence supporting respiratory or fomite-associated transmission.] [Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.Maps of the 3 countries affected by the latest Ebola outbreak in W.
