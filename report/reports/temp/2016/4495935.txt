Health officials said the cases have been tracked since 1 May 2016, and they expect many other people might have been exposed.""At most, we had 37 contacts who were followed after contact, with one confirmed case. Another case had 14 contacts,"" said Gail Scott, director of the health department. ""Usually, there are at least 3 to 5 contacts who need notification and possible treatment or isolation. It is never just the one confirmed patient who is affected by this illness.""Health officials said vaccination is the best defense against whooping cough. Pertussis is a contagious bacterial disease affecting the respiratory tract and is spread by coughing and often through repeated face-to-face contact.Anyone with symptoms is asked to contact their healthcare provider about antimicrobial treatment that can shorten the time when they are contagious. Anyone with pertussis should be isolated from school, work or other activities until completing at least the 1st 5 days of the recommended antimicrobial therapy.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Virginia (Lynchburg)Date: Thu 15 Sep 2016Source: News Advance [edited]<http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/update-whooping-cough-confirmed-at-e-c-glass-in-lynchburg/article_ff1796dc-7b5d-11e6-9497-a77239f4db3c.html>A case of whooping cough has been confirmed at E.C. Glass High School---------------------------------------------------------------------Lynchburg City Schools [Virginia] circulated a letter to parents, guardians and staff on Monday, 12 Sep 2016, to confirm the diagnosis and provide details on the symptoms and treatment of whooping cough. Known clinically as pertussis, whooping cough is a common, vaccine-preventable disease.Haley Evans, epidemiologist for the Central Virginia Health District, said whooping cough is a persistent respiratory infection and can be contracted by those who are vaccinated against the illness. ""No vaccine is perfect; vaccinated people can still come down with pertussis,"" Evans said. They typically will experience milder symptoms, she said, but still are contagious.Pertussis has a debilitating effect, according to Evans. ""Anyone diagnosed with pertussis would be excluded from school, work, or daycare, until they have completed 5 days of antibiotics therapy,"" she said. ""Anyone with a cough that has lasted more than 2 weeks, we would recommend that they see their primary care physician,"" Evans said. ""People with pertussis will continue to cough for many weeks after they have been appropriately treated. They are no longer contagious, but we just can't stop the cough; the cough kind of has to run its course,"" she explained. Evans added that unvaccinated children and adults are at the highest risk for pertussis, which she described as highly contagious.In 2015, there were 334 reported cases of whooping cough in Virginia, according to the CDC 2015 Provisional Pertussis Surveillance Report, released in January 2016.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] New Jersey (Morris County)Date: Tue 13 Sep 2016Source: NJ.com [edited]<http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2016/09/case_of_whooping_cough_confirmed_at_chatham_high_s.html>A high school student was treated over the summer for a case of pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, the district said in a notice to parents on Monday, 12 Sep 2016. The Madison Health Department informed the district on Monday, 12 Sep 2016, the student had tested positive for the disease and has since been treated, superintendent Michael LaSusa said Tuesday morning [13 Sep 2016]. The student, he said, has been in school since the beginning of the year.""No other student has been diagnosed and we are hopeful that this will be the only case,"" LaSusa said, adding a notice was sent to parents ""in an effort to be forthcoming and transparent in the event another child develops symptoms.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the best way to protect against the disease is by vaccination. According to the state health department, about 9500 New Jersey school children skipped receiving vaccines for the 2015-16 school year. Under state law, children are permitted to opt out of receiving vaccinations for religious reasons.[byline: Justin Zaremba]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The evolution of new clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, which are less prevented by the current acellular vaccine, and the presence of an underimmunized cohort of individuals may play a role in the number of cases described here. It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ that can infect infants less than 1 year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, who are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 per cent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis was associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least 1 dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all-acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.References----------1.
