24 Horas [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.24horas.cl/nacional/detectan-dos-casos-de-virus-hanta-en-la-region-del-maule-1906414>On Tuesday [19 Jan 2016], 2 cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] were confirmed, one each in the Maule [and Metropolitan] regions. The individuals were a 60 year old housewife, who was infected in the Miraflores area, Linares community, and a 33 year old agricultural worker. The woman was taken to the Las Condes Clinic and the man to the Thorax Hospital in the [Santiago] Metropolitan region.Both are the 1st confirmed cases in the region so far in 2016 and both are in a stable but serious condition.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 2nd case of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Santiago Metropolitan region in the past 5 weeks. The above report provides no information about the circumstances under which the 2 patients acquired their hantavirus infections, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Although cases of hantavirus infections are relatively rare in the Santiago Metropolitan Region in Chile, as noted in previous reports from Chile, cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <http://www.hantavirus.cl/ecologia_enfermedad/galeria_reservorio.htm>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5078>. - Mod.TY]
