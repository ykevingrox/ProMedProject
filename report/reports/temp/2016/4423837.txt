Fox News, Reuters report [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/08/17/thousands-queue-in-congo-for-emergency-yellow-fever-vaccinations.html>Thousands of people in Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa queued up on [Wed 17 Aug 2016] for emergency yellow fever vaccinations aimed at limiting one of the worst outbreaks in decades that has killed hundreds in the region this year [2016].Makeshift clinics in churches and schools opened across the densely populated city of over 10 million and in other areas bordering Angola, part of a World Health Organization-led (WHO) campaign against an epidemic that has mostly affected Angola.Health officials expect to vaccinate 14 million people over the next 10 days, including 8.5 million in Kinshasa, where there are fears of a far wider spread. That adds to the 13 million in Angola and 3 million in Congo already vaccinated this year [2016].Those queuing will receive a 1/5 dose of the vaccine in order to eke out limited global supplies. The lower dose protects for 12 months but does not give lifelong immunity [the duration of immunity beyond 12 months is not known. - Mod.TY]""People are coming in large numbers to get vaccinated. There is a lot of enthusiasm,"" said Eugene Kabambi, a WHO spokesman in Congo. He acknowledged the challenges of such a vast vaccination drive, including keeping vaccinations cold in areas without electricity.""We are in an urban milieu where more than 7 million people await their vaccine,"" he said.At other locations in the city, things ran more smoothly.Close to 100 people lined up at a vaccination site outside a church in the Gombe district. Tables were set up with cold boxes for the vaccine and yellow medical boxes for waste disposal.[A 32-year-old man] came for a vaccination at the Gombe church after hearing about the impact of yellow fever in Angola. ""It's a very evil disease,"" he said after his injection. ""That hurt for a little while, but now it's getting better.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This vaccination campaign is a massive undertaking in a relatively short period of time. No mention is made of vaccine shortage so presumably the stocks of vaccine are adequate for the task. The decision to administer the vaccine with dose fractionation (1/5 the usual dose volume) essentially extends the usual coverage about 5-fold. It is good to learn that the campaign is proceeding relatively smoothly. - Mod.TYMaps of the Democratic Republic of the Congo can be seen at<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2015/06/Decentralized-provinces-of-the-DRC-CDRC_DG002_122.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Huila province, AngolaDate: Tue 16 Aug 2016Source: AllAfrica, Angola Press report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201608170836.html>At least 317 701 citizens living in the capital seat of the province of Huila, Lubango, were vaccinated against yellow fever during the immunization campaign of the outbreak, which began last [Sat 13 Aug 2016].The information was released Tuesday [16 Aug 2016] to Angop, by the municipal director of health, Judith Santos, noting that the campaign reached within 72 hours, 42 percent, since the forecast is to immunize by [22 Aug 2016], 746 078 people.He indicated that for the activity were provided 800 000 doses of vaccines which are being administered by 2300 integrated vaccinators in 127 teams that are deployed in the municipalities of Huila, Quilemba, Hoque, Arimba, and capital seat.He expressed satisfaction with the adhesion of the people to vaccination sites, a clear demonstration of the will to help stem the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There has been considerable concern about the occurrence of cases in the outlying provinces. It is essential that vaccination coverage be provided in these less populated areas, so that the outbreak does not smolder with the risk of flare ups in the near future. Covering these more remote areas poses a logistical challenge, and one hopes that they can be reached before the onset of the rainy season, when many roads become impassable. - Mod.TYMaps of Angola can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32978>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
