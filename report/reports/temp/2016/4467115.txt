Horti Daily [edited]<http://www.hortidaily.com/article/28580/US->Approximately 40 Milton-Union Middle School students were treated on Friday [2 Sep 2016] by medics after they ingested suspected ghost peppers at the school, officials said.The incident happened during the lunch period, and the district was still working to determine how many students were involved and where the hot peppers came from, said Superintendent Brad Ritchey of Milton-Union Exempted Village Schools.West Milton police and emergency crews from Englewood and Union were called at 12:06 p.m. to the school on Milton-Potsdam Road. The investigation revealed all involved students ""took these peppers voluntarily,"" according to police.In total, 5 students were taken to local hospitals, and approximately 40 students -- ages 11 to 14 -- had ingested the peppers.Ritchey said symptoms ranged from blotchy skin, hives, tearing of eyes, sweating and general discomfort.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The clinical signs described in the affected students are the general reactions from eating extremely hot peppers. This is not a toxin, so much as a physiological reaction to extreme heat in the mouth, and then swallowing the source of the heat into the stomach. Mild stomach pain may follow. The extreme heat and burning sensation experienced by the mouth may also be experienced by the rectum when digested hot peppers are passed out of the body.The ""heat"" unit of hot pepper is measured in Scoville heat units or (SHUs). The ghost pepper was at one time ranked as the hottest pepper in the world until 2011, when the infinity pepper was ranked with more SHU's, thereby exceeding the ghost pepper.The ghost pepper is also known as bhut jolokia. The pepper rates at 855 000 to 1 041 427 Scoville heat units, a measurement of spiciness, or heat. That's 107 to 417 times hotter than a jalapeÌ±o and 10 times hotter than a habaÌ±ero.Because of the heat, a 150 pound (68 kg) person consuming 3 pounds (1.3 kg) of peppers could die.
