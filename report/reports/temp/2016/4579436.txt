Ahead of the upcoming resource mobilization efforts, the Government of the Republic of Guinea sent a strong signal of commitment to all partners by announcing a USD 5 million pledge from its own resources.The FNRPE will support the implementation of a USD 550 million plan organized around 5 pillars: (1) economic recovery, women's entrepreneurship and youth employment; (2) social protection and support to vulnerable groups; (3) water, hygiene and sanitation; (4) governance and social cohesion and (5) health, risk reduction and contingency. The FNRPE will be managed in accordance with the principles of the Paris Declaration and the New Deal. The Steering Committee will be chaired by the Minister of Economy and Finance, and participation of representatives of the United Nations and other development partners will ensure that all decisions are taken in a true spirit of partnership and transparency.]21 Oct 2016 Liberia: The psychological scars of Ebola: Report<http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/liberia-psychological-scars-ebola>[From MÌ©decins Sans FrontiÌ¬res [Doctors Without Borders (MSF)]Two years after the peak of the Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreak in Liberia, survivors, as well as their families and health workers, are gradually rebuilding their lives. As MSF transfers its mental health services to the Liberian Ministry of Health, MSF psychiatrist FrÌ©dÌ©ric Gelly describes the process of psychological healing:(Interview with MSF psychiatrist FrÌ©dÌ©ric Gelly):""Q: What effect did the Ebola epidemic have on people's mental health?""A: More than 4800 Liberians died from Ebola in 2014 and 2015. Many people saw relatives die; some lost their whole families. Others continue to suffer from an extreme sense of guilt, for being the 1st in their family to catch Ebola and spread it to others, or for being the only one who survived. Two years later, they ask themselves over and over again: 'Why did I survive and others die?'""Religion is one way to deal with death, including rituals around burials. A shared sense of community and common beliefs can help reduce the pain and trauma of those close to you dying. But at the height of the epidemic, even this possibility was denied, as the government had to lay down strict rules about cremating the dead and forbade burial ceremonies.""...more][The 2014-2015 EBOV [Ebola virus] epidemic, which continued for over 2 years, was the longest EBOV outbreak to date, causing a devastating impact on West African populations. - Mod.LK]19 Oct 2016 Uganda: Travelers eating baboon meat on the Gulu Highway<http://allafrica.com/stories/201610190355.html>[The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) has warned that there is a high chance that travelers that eat roadside mchomo (roast meat) could be eating baboon meat. Andrew Sseguya, the UWA executive director, said baboon meat is sold as illegal bush meat at Kafu along the Kampala-Gulu highway. ""We have arrested a number of people from Kafu selling baboon meat as kob meat,"" Sseguya told journalists at the UWA headquarters at Kitante, Kampala. Consumers also are sold dead calf meet as bush meat.According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), consumption of meat from primates (monkeys, baboons, gorillas and chimpanzees) can lead to contraction of viruses such as the deadly Ebola virus.It also links Ebola infections in people to handling and eating infected animals. In 2012, CDC also identified evidence of viruses -- such as simian foamy virus -- in illegally imported wildlife products impounded at several US airports.][There are so many reasons one should not eat bush meat, e.g. disease risk, wildlife conservation, tourism, economics, but other sources of nutrition must be identified before we can even hope this practice will stop. - Mod.LK]Research-------21 Oct 2016: The 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa highlights no evidence of rapid evolution or adaptation to humans.<http://www.pubpdf.com/pub/27767073/The-2014-Ebola-virus-outbreak-in-West-Africa-highlights-no-evidence-of-rapid-evolution-or-adaptation>[Citation.Li X, Zai J, Liu H, Liu H, et al. (EPub 21 Dec 2016). The 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa highlights no evidence of rapid evolution or adaptation to humans. Sci Rep 2016 Oct 21;6:35822. Epub 21 Dec 2016 2<http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep35822>Abstract.Following its immergence in December 2013, the recent Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa has spread and persisted for more than 2 years, making it the largest EBOV epidemic in both scale and geographical region to date. In this study, a total of 726 glycoprotein (GP) gene sequences of the EBOV full-length genome obtained from West Africa from the 2014 outbreak, combined with 30 from earlier outbreaks between 1976 and 2008 were used to investigate the genetic divergence, evolutionary history, population dynamics, and selection pressure of EBOV among distinct epidemic waves. Results from our dataset showed that no non-synonymous substitutions occurred on the GP gene coding sequences of EBOV that were likely to have affected protein structure or function in any way.][A previous study noted rapid accumulation of interhost and intrahost genetic variation. They found the observed substitution rate was roughly twice as high within the 2014 outbreak as between outbreaks. Mutations were also more frequently nonsynonymous during the outbreak. Similar findings have been seen previously and are consistent with expectations from incomplete purifying selection. ... The investigators identified 395 mutations, including 50 fixed nonsynonymous changes with 8 at positions with high levels of conservation across ebolaviruses. (SK Gire et al. Science 12 Sep 2014: Vol. 345, Issue 6202, pp. 1369-1372)].[In this early study, the biological significance of the mutations was not evaluated. Since EBOV is an RNA virus, the mutations were not surprising. - Mod.LK][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at: <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>. - Mod.LKProMED HealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54> Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>][See Also:Ebola update (62): news, research, treatment, funding 20161017.4564066Ebola update (61): news, funding, economy 20161009.4547627Ebola update (60): news, research, economy 20161002.4531285Ebola update (59): news, research, funding 20160925.4514591Ebola update (58): news, research, funding, vaccine 20160918.4497393Ebola update (57): news, research, funding 20160911.4481043Ebola update (56): news, vaccine, research 20160904.4465145Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350].................................................lk/msp/ml"
