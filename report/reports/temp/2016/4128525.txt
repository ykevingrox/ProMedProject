The disease can be spread through direct contact with an infected person or by sharing the same airspace as an infected person. The virus can also remain in the air for up to 75 minutes after a person infected with measles has left the area.Anyone who has not already had measles or been vaccinated against the virus is at risk of developing the disease.Under California's health and safety code, the county's public health officer can exclude unvaccinated students from school to protect against an outbreak of the disease.The letter issued to Yuba River Charter parents Monday [28 Mar 2016] afternoon by Nevada County Health Officer Ken Cutler requests that parents keep children who aren't vaccinated under home quarantine through 8 Apr 2016, or 21 days after the 17 Mar 2016 exposure date.According to the letter, that means those children ""should not visit any public locations unless it is necessary to obtain medical care"" during that time.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of California, United States may be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31501>.]******[2] Africa (Liberia, Chad) measlesDate: Tue 29 Mar 2016Source: All Africa [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201603290762.html>A measles statistic on countries in Central and West Africa has placed Liberia and Chad on top of the epidemic death toll.Spread through coughing or sneezing, measles is among the world's most contagious diseases and one of the leading causes of death among children worldwide, especially those who are malnourished, a collaborative work prepared by World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF) said.According to the UNICEF, WCARO-Media Centre Website on Measles Outbreaks, Liberia and Chad have recorded the highest number of deaths in countries affected by the epidemic as of 28 Mar 2016.UNICEF is the arm of the United Nations that addresses issues affecting children worldwide.Liberia is currently fighting the latest outbreak of measles, a few months after the country was declared free of the Ebola virus disease (EDV), which killed more than 11 000 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the 3 countries believed to be the hardest hit Ebola nations.Recently, the Liberian government announced that 10 out of the country's 15 counties were experiencing a measles outbreak, warning that the disease could affect more children in the coming weeks.Deputy Health Minister and Head of the Incident Management System, Tolbert Nyenswah, is on record of saying the measles outbreak is as a result of the gaps created by the deadly Ebola virus, which paralyzed the entire health system.He explained that during the period when Liberia was battling against the Ebola virus disease (EVD), children were not immunized against measles.According to the statistics, other affected countries include Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, CÌ«te d'Ivoire, Cameroon, DR Congo and Guinea. Others are Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.The statistics revealed that Liberia has recorded 1341 cases with 34 deaths, while Chad has recorded 5832 cases with 79 deaths. The 2 countries are followed by Nigeria, which has recorded 3804 cases with 26 deaths.The statistic said the countries affected as of 28 Mar [2016] are Benin (85 cases, 0 deaths), Burkina Faso (1258 cases, 10 deaths), Central African Republic (31 cases, 0 deaths) CÌ«te d'Ivoire (491 cases, 3 deaths) and Cameroon (1338 cases, 6 deaths).DR Congo is named in the statistics as recording (3976 cases, 13 deaths), Guinea (1013 cases, 2 deaths), Mauritania (863 cases, 9 deaths) and Mali (774 cases, 1 death).Niger has so far recorded (352 cases, 1 death), Senegal (560 cases, 0 deaths), Sierra Leone (351 cases, 1 death) and Togo (295 cases, 0 deaths) according to the statistics.Between 2000 and 2008, global measles mortality in all ages was reduced by 78%, from an estimated 733 000 deaths in 2000 to an estimated 164 000 deaths in 2008.But according to the Measles Initiative, a partnership funded in 2001 was led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UNICEF and the World Health Organization, which helped to reduce mortality.According to a WHO report, an estimated 400 children died from measles every day in developing countries and other parts of the world. It indicated that even healthy and well-nourished children (in developed countries), if unvaccinated, are at risk of the disease, and its severe health complications include pneumonia, diarrhoea, and encephalitis (a dangerous infection of the brain causing inflammation).Deputy Minister Nyenswah said the issue of measles affecting children in Liberia in 10 out of 15 counties is becoming increasingly serious, noting that government is launching the Integrated Measles, Polio and Deworming Campaign in an effort to tackle the disease. He's calling on parents to bring their children under the age of 5 for vaccination to avert what he calls a ""pending health crisis."" He wants at least 98% of children immunized fully in order to protect the 2% who are not immunized.[Byline: Necus M. Andrews]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The side effects of Ebola are far-reaching, and may extend beyond the borders of the 3 countries directly affected. Immunizations against vaccine-preventable diseases were interrupted, the consequences of which are seen here in the figures for measles cases in children. Stress placed by Ebola on West Africa's public health infrastructure led to clusters of unvaccinated children susceptible to infection. According to the WHO, most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease more commonly in children under the age of 5, or adults over the age of 20. Complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.A map of Chad may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57> A map of Liberia may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>. - Mod.LK]******[3] Correction UK vaccination coverageDate: 26 Mar 2016Source: Anthony Ellam <tonypj@meadlane.freeserve.co.uk> [edited]The measles update (Archive No 20160312.4088597) referred to 2 reports.
