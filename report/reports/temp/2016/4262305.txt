Around 30 per cent of people with measles will develop complications, and 1 in 10 may require hospital treatment,"" says Dr Coleman.""It can affect both children and adults. Low immunisation levels among certain age groups mean outbreaks can spread.""Measles is now rare in New Zealand thanks to immunisation. The Government has made immunisation a priority and as a result we've significantly increased immunisation rates among young babies and children.""Outbreaks like these are an important reminder for Kiwis to ensure they're immunised, or to check their immunisation status if they're unsure.""Over 400 000 New Zealanders, mostly between the ages of 10 and 29, are at risk of catching measles in an outbreak. Most older and middle aged adults have already been exposed and are immune, and most young children have been vaccinated.You need 2 doses of MMR vaccine to be best protected. Anyone born from 1 Jan 1969 who has not had 2 vaccine doses is eligible for free vaccination.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[From 2 to 5 per cent of people do not respond to their 1st dose of measles vaccine, which is why a 2nd (booster) dose is recommended. But more than 99 per cent of people develop immunity to measles after 2 doses of MMR.Maps of New Zealand can be seen at <http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>. - Mod.LK]******[2] SudanDate: Mon 30 May 2016Source: AllAfrica, Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201605310237.html>[Measles vaccination started in 6 states in Sudan. There have been 1073 confirmed cases and 10 deaths up to the end of week 19 (13 May 2016).]Measles Campaign Concludes--------------------------A sub-national measles campaign is targeting more than 4 million children in 5 states of Sudan from 22-30 May 2016. On 22 May [2016], the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Sudan, the World Health Organizaton (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) launched a sub-national measles campaign in 6 states -- Blue Nile, North Kordofan, South Kordofan, White Nile, and Sennar -- targeting more than 4 million children aged from 6 months to 15 years. The campaign ran until 30 May [2016] and covered the new South Sudanese arrivals in these states as well.The campaign is complementary to the campaigns implemented in 2015 that covered 10 states when 9.5 million children were vaccinated. The vaccination campaign has already been completed in West Kordofan State where 728 586 children were vaccinated against measles, indicating coverage of 99 per cent of the target.The effect of the previous campaign is a reduction of measles cases compared to the same period of the last year. In 2015, up to week 19 there were 2498 confirmed measles cases and 38 deaths, compared to 1073 confirmed cases and 10 deaths reported this year by the end of the week 19 (13 May 2016), according to the MoH.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is notable that with vaccination, Sudan has been able to cut their case numbers in half, and deaths by even more. The country is to be congratulated for its effort.A map of the Sudan can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96>. - Mod.LK]******[3] IrelandDate: Wed 1 Jun 2016Source: Irish Times [edited]<http://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/nineteen-measles-cases-identified-in-ongoing-outbreak-1.2669123>Ireland: 19 measles cases, of which 13 have been confirmed; most had not been vaccinated--------------------------------------------------------------------------------HSE [Health Service Executive] investigating spread of infectious disease among those under 30 years of ageThe HSE said the best way to protect against measles is to get the MMR vaccine. Any adult born since 1978 should have received 2 doses to prevent measles.The HSE is investigating an ongoing measles outbreak among young people across the State.  Outbreak control teams have been convened in HSE East, South and Midwest. Nineteen measles cases linked to the outbreak have been identified to date, of which 13 are confirmed and 6 are probable.  All cases have been identified in the under 30 age group, with most cases occurring in the 15-19 year age group.The HSE says it believes the source of infection most likely came from another European country where measles outbreaks are occurring. Most of those who have been infected as a result of this outbreak did not know that they had been in contact with measles.  It is also known that most had not received the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine.Dr Kevin Kelleher said measles is highly infectious and if cases are isolated early, the risk of transmission to vulnerable people decreases. ""The time between exposure to the virus and developing measles rash is normally 14 days [range 7-21 days]. People are infectious from 4 days before rash starts until 4 days after,"" said Dr Kelleher.Areas of the country where individuals confirmed with measles have been while infectious in the past month include Dublin, Dingle and Tralee in Co Kerry, and west Limerick.People who are fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine are normally protected.Most at risk------------Those most at risk are those who are not fully vaccinated, babies (younger than 12 months so too young to be vaccinated), and those with weakened immune systems if exposed.Measles symptoms include: high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a red rash that starts on the head and spreads down the body, which starts a few days after the infection takes hold.It said all children should get the MMR vaccine at 12 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-5 years of age.  The HSE urged parents of any child who missed their scheduled MMR vaccine dose to contact their GP to get the age appropriate dose.The HSE said if anyone develops measles symptoms, they should stay at home and phone their GP, tell the doctor or nurse that they think they might have measles and stop visitors coming to the house to prevent spreading the infection.[Byline: Aine McMahon]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Ireland can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39>. - Mod.LK]
