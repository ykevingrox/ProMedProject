There is significant movement of livestock including goats within the district. Interdistrict movement of livestock is also common. In addition, there is movement of livestock including goats across the international borders. Livestock movement is mainly for trade, gifts, dowry, search for water and pasture among others. A goat on a farm in Kashenyi village, Kicumbi parish, Kamuganguzi subcounty, showed clinical signs of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) and PCR confirmed presence of RVF virus.Outbreak statistics (rates apparent, expressed in percentages) Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost* Goats / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughterEpidemiologySource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive Epidemiological comments: Human cases were reported and confirmed in the same area.Control measuresMeasures applied: Movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestation; traceability; dipping/spraying; quarantine; control of vectors; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animalsMeasures to be applied: No other measures Diagnostic test resultsLaboratory name and type: Uganda Virus Research Institute Laboratory (national laboratory)Tests and resultsSpecies / Test / Test date / ResultGoats / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 24 Mar 2016 / PositiveFuture reportingThe event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Several cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) have been recently diagnosed in humans in Uganda's south-western province Kabale, bordering Rwanda. Traditionally, RVF is known to cause a severe disease in ruminants, with mortality rates in juvenile ruminants, particularly lambs and kids, known to exceed 50 percent and in newborn animals even significantly higher. The main symptom in adult animals is abortion. Human disease follows the disease in animals by exposure to infected animal tissues such as aborted foeti, placentae, organs and blood, as well as by arthropod vectors transmitting the virus from the viraemic animals to human victims.Antibodies in humans were reported in Uganda in 1936. During the period 1944-1967, RVF virus was isolated from mosquitoes and humans. In 1968, a limited epidemic was reported in humans. A cross-sectional study published in 2013 reported serological evidence in goats in Sembabule, Mpigi, Masaka and Mubende districts of Uganda.Subscribers are referred to the commentary by Mod.MPP in posting 20160317.4099896. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3948>.]
