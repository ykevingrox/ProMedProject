This is the 6th case so far this year [2016] and the 3rd death caused by this virus.The situation was confirmed by the regional SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial agency], which indicated that the individual is a 63 year old farmer who lived in a rural area in CuracautÌ n.The man was taken to the community hospital, from where he was taken to the Hospital de Victoria. However, 2 days later, because his health situation was delicate, he was moved to the Hospital del TÌ rax in Santiago, dying en route.The [samples] for testing taken from the patient were sent to the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia, where the hantavirus infection was confirmed.Meanwhile, the teams of Epidemiology, Zoonoses and Occupational Health of the AraucanÌ a SEREMI investigation are in charge of the investigations, which must determine the locale where the infection was acquired.[published by Nicole Briones; information from Amparo Montoya]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the AraucanÌ a region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The above report provides little information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5111>. - Mod.TY]
