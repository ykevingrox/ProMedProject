However, the reported cases set on all alarms. Officers from the Ministry of Health have asked affected patients where they purchased the sausage products, in order to inspect such places in order to limit the occurrence of new cases.What is trichinosis [trichinellosis]?-------------------------------------It is a disease caused by a parasitic worm that lives in the muscles of pigs and other wild animals, such as boars and pumas. Humans may acquire the disease by eating undercooked pork or sausage products, particularly those that are home-made. In the case of pigs, these animals acquire the disease by eating food waste in garbage dumps, where there is also a significant rodent population.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_Trichinella_ spp. are common in pigs in Argentina, and ProMED-mail has reported several outbreaks since 1999. So-called ""back-yard"" pigs are slaughtered without veterinary control and the home made sausages might be sold on markets and consumed locally. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53505>.]
