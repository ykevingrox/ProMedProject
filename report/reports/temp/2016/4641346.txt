Soon after eating the forest fruit, children started vomiting and some of them, as per reports reaching the district headquarters even lost consciousness and their condition became serious.The children were immediately rushed to the Sherghati sub-divisional hospital.Confirming the incident of children falling ill, Gaya district magistrate Kumar Ravi said children were undergoing treatment in government hospital. All the children were out of danger, he added.The Sherghati subdivisional officer (SDO) was camping in the hospital and the civil surgeon has been asked to ensure proper treatment of children.According to Prof Ataur Rahman, MG College, Gaya, the fruit-bearing plant is called gatropha gossypifoila from Euphorbiaceae plant family. Poisonous in nature, the plant has got medicinal value in making antibiotics for treatment of _E. coli_, said the plant scientist.Children should be careful when they go to forest area. This is the 2nd time in recent past that children have fallen ill after eating the particular forest fruit.""An awareness campaign will be launched in the area to educate people about the harmful fruits,"" said the district magistrate here on Friday.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Gatropa gossypifoila is more commonly known as _Jatropha gossypiifolia_ L. (Euphorbiaceae), popularly known worldwide as ""bellyache bush"" or ""black physicnut."" It is a pantropical species originating from South America that is cultivated in tropical countries throughout the world [20-22]. With a common name of ""bellyache bush"" I think it is likely we understand what the children were suffering from and we are glad to hear they have recovered. The castor bean is closely related to this plant.The name ""Jatropha"" is derived from the Greek words ""jatros,"" which means ""doctor"" and ""trophe,"" meaning ""food,"" which is associated with its medicinal uses [3]. The Jatropha genus is divided into 2 subgenera, Jatropha and curcas, from which the subgenus Jatropha has the widest distribution, with species found in Africa, India, South America, West Indies, Central America, and the Caribbean [4]. Jatropha species are used in traditional medicine to cure various ailments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America or as ornamental plants and energy crops [3]. Several known species from genus Jatropha have been reported for their medicinal uses, chemical constituents, and biological activities such as _Jatropha curcas_, _Jatropha elliptica_, _Jatropha gossypiifolia_, and _Jatropha mollissima_, among others [3].From these species, _Jatropha gossypiifolia_ L. is discussed here. It is a multipurpose medicinal plant largely used in folk medicine for the treatment of various diseases [3, 5, 6].An important feature of _J. gossypiifolia_ species is that, due to its important potential medicinal applications, in Brazil, it is included in the National List of Medicinal Plants of Interest to the Brazilian Public Health System (RelaÌ¤Ì£o Nacional de Plantas Medicinais de Interesse ao Sistema Ì nico de SaÌ¼de Brasileiro -- RENISUS), which is a report published by the Brazilian Health Ministry in February 2009 that includes 71 species of medicinal plants that have the potential to generate pharmaceutical products of interest to public health of Brazil [14].Regarding its phytochemical constitution, alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, lignoids, phenols, saponins, steroids, tannins, and terpenoids were already detected in different extracts from different parts of this plant [15].Among the main activities already studied for this species (including various types of extracts from different parts of the plant), the antihypertensive, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antineoplasic activities mainly stand out, supporting some of its popular uses [3, 16].Various chemical constituents have been detected in extracts from different parts of _J. gossypiifolia_, the literature having reported, in general, the presence of fatty acids, sugars, alkaloids, amino acids, coumarins, steroids, flavonoids, lignans, proteins, saponins, tannins, and terpenoids.Some toxicity studies have shown that despite the known toxicity of Jatropha species, _J. gossypiifolia_ presented low toxicity in some in vitro and in vivo experiments. However, some studies have indicated that ethanolic extract from the leaves, in acute oral use, is safe for rats, but with chronic use, it could be toxic [17-19].Clearly there are properties about the plant that may lend itself to some herbal medicinal products, but there are also some components that could be toxic and certainly more study is needed.References1.
