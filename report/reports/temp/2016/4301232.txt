The Jakarta Post [edited]<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/06/20/islands-focus-anthrax-allegedly-behind-cows-deaths.html>21 cows are reported to have fallen sick and died in Batu Layar, Gorontalo regency, Gorontalo over the past few weeks. The deaths are allegedly due to anthrax.While anthrax commonly affects hoofed animals, humans also get sick from anthrax. The most common type of anthrax infection in people is cutaneous anthrax, an infection of the skin.Local animal husbandry official Vivi Tayeb said the cases became known following reports that locals had contracted cutaneous anthrax. ""I call on people not to slaughter sick animals because the blood of the animals that have contracted anthrax contains very dangerous spores,"" said Vivi as quoted by Antara over the weekend.Based on a preliminary investigation, Vivi added that some of the sick cows had been slaughtered, and the meat was subsequently distributed around the subdistrict for sale and consumption.Over 100 cows are said to have symptoms of anthrax in Gorontalo regency; approximately 8000 cows have been vaccinated.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: 21 Jun 2016Source: The Jakarta Post [edited]<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/06/21/anthrax-rise-gorontalo.html>Gorontalo province has once again been hit by an anthrax outbreak, with the number of people infected by the [bacteria] reportedly on the rise. Initially, health officials detected that 11 residents, including a 4-year-old boy, were infected by skin anthrax in Pangadaa village in Dungaliyo subdistrict and Batulayar village in Bongomeme subdistrict. That number has now reached 14 people.The anthrax outbreak initially came to light over the past week, when a community health center (puskesmas) in Dunggaliyo and Bongomeme subdistricts, Gorontalo regency, treated a toddler with a black blister over his eyes that caused the eyes to shut. The boy is now being cared for at Dunda Limb Hospital, while 13 other residents in 2 villages have refused to be treated in hospital, despite 3 of them suffering severe infection. ""For the time being, they are being treated at home and given antibiotics. We are trying to persuade them to go to hospital,"" Gorontalo regency Health Agency head Roni Sampir told The Jakarta Post on Monday [20 Jun 2016].According to Roni, residents infected by anthrax are reluctant to seek treatment in hospital because of the distance from their homes in remote villages.Earlier, more than 20 cows in the 2 villages fell sick and abruptly died. Most of the people subsequently exposed to anthrax had slaughtered the infected cows or consumed beef contaminated with the [bacteria]. In addition, beef infected with anthrax was being sold in the surrounding villages. No deaths of livestock were reported to health officers or relevant agencies.Anthrax initially broke out in the province in April 2016 around the shores of Lake Limboto. Five residents of Tilango subdistrict, Gorontalo regency, were forced to undergo intensive care after experiencing nausea and vomiting, followed by vesicular lesions on their skin. The outbreak also spread to Bone Bolango regency. The Gorontalo Plantation and Livestock Agency declared 2 sub-districts to be suffering an anthrax epidemic, with more than 100 head of cattle and buffalo infected with anthrax and 8000 head vaccinated.Animal husbandry officer Fenny Rimporok said the office was also forced to ask police to seal the beef section of Gorontalo Central Market, where infected beef had been sold.The epidemic has hit beef sellers hard, their income plummeting 80 percent in recent months. Bank Indonesia (BI) Gorontalo branch head Suryono said the outbreak had not adversely affected the wider economy but had influenced people's behavior. ""Stalls serving beef have now begun to reduce the amount of beef in dishes,"" said Suryono.The local BI branch has provided 15 000 doses of anthrax vaccine to combat the disease. According to Suryono, BI assists around 300 cattle ranchers in the province, with the number of cattle reaching 1000.[Byline: Syamsul Huda M. Suhari]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Gorontalo is a province of Indonesia. It is located in the northern tip of the island of Sulawesi on the Minahassa Peninsula. See: <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/indonesia_pol_2002.jpg> and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorontalo>.This is a classic human epidemic following upon the slaughter and butchering of animals sick with anthrax and which only came to light when human cases presented themselves at clinics. Fortunately, the latter recognised the typical skin lesions. But this means that any response is 1-2 weeks late, and people will, in addition out of embarrassment, not reveal that they had handled, purchased, or eaten the infected meat. Before they finish, every vial of Sterne will have been used.The backstory is that this is not a new problem and a proactive livestock control and surveillance program should have been in place. The only way to bring back confidence in the beef is to stop this epidemic and prevent it happening in coming years. That help was not sought when the cattle started dying is very telling. I have said it before, and I will say it again, when humans get anthrax, it is the fault of the veterinary services, period.Successfully treating humans can be very difficult. Cutaneous lesions respond quickly and well to antibiotics; systemic infections are usually fatal unless you have a very experienced medical team. It is far more cost effective to prevent humans getting infected in the 1st place in spite of themselves, by preventing any and all livestock cases. The Sterne vaccine is very reliable and costs pennies; dead cows are expensive, both in lost income and in replacement costs. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/564>.]
