Oroville Mercury Register [edited]<http://www.orovillemr.com/general-news/20160714/health-warning-issued-about-lake-shasta-algae-bloom>Visitors to Lake Shasta [California] should take care if they go to the Pit River arm, where blue-green algae has bloomed and could sicken visitors, according to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.The algae, also known as cyanobacteria, produce toxins that can sicken people and animals with flu-like symptoms, according to a press release the board issued Thursday [14 Jul 2016].However, the state is still testing the water to see if the toxins are present.Until the testing is complete, visitors should avoid going in the water and keep pets from drinking the water in the area. They also should not eat or drink anything from the water.Normal water filtration techniques won't eliminate toxins, so cooking with the water should be avoided as well, the agency said.Anyone exposed should seek medical treatment immediately.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Lake Shasta, California, is a popular houseboating and recreation center [<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_Lake>]. The following has been extracted from Mod.TG's commentary in ProMED-mail post 20160617.4292648:""Blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) are the only group of algae to be toxic in freshwaters. They are microscopic bacteria living in water, and are capable of photosynthesising which is why they are often called algae. Though microscopic, when they form colonies and accumulate together they can become visible to the naked eye. Blue-green algae can produce potent liver and neurotoxins as well as skin irritants. However, not all blue-green algae are toxic, and even toxic species do not always produce toxins. But telling the difference in toxic and non-toxic species is challenging.""
