The Horse [edited]<http://www.thehorse.com/articles/38395/kentucky-confirms-two-new-equine-wnv-cases>The Kentucky state veterinarian's office has announced that 2 horses -- one from Logan County and one in Union County -- have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). These are the 5th and 6th equine WNV cases confirmed in the commonwealth this year [2016], Kentucky Equine Programs manager ES ""Rusty"" Ford said in a statement.In Logan County, a 10 year old Belgian mare with no WNV vaccination history began displaying signs of disease -- including lethargy, mild ataxia (incoordination, predominantly in the hind limbs), and loss of appetite -- on [31 Oct 2016]. As of [3 Nov 2016], the attending veterinarian reported the mare was showing signs of improvement.In Union County, a 2 year old American saddlebred colt with no WNV vaccination history began exhibiting muscle fasciculation (twitching) and mild ataxia on [31 Oct 2016]. As of [?1 Nov 2016], the colt was reported to be in a stable condition.In his statement, Ford said none of the 6 Kentucky horses that contracted WNV had been vaccinated.West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or ""just not with it""; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and ""spinal"" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the two-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.[byline: Erica Larson]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Tennessee: WNV (Dyer, Gibson counties) alert; EEE (Chester County)Date: Mon 7 Nov 2016 8:18 pm CETSource: WBRC Fox6 News [edited]<http://www.wbrc.com/story/33649521/tennessee-warns-that-livestock-need-to-be-vaccinated>State officials are asking residents of West Tennessee to continue to vaccinate their livestock against mosquitoborne illnesses. Recently 2 horses in Dyer County and Gibson County tested positive for West Nile virus [WNV]. A horse in Chester County tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]. Both are fatal diseases in horses.Sick horses cannot directly infect people, but if a mosquito bites a sick horse and then bites a human, it can pass either WNV or EEE to the human. While there are no effective vaccines for people against either disease, the equine vaccines are effective and can protect livestock against these fatal mosquitoborne illnesses.""We typically think of mosquitoes as a summer-time pest,"" state veterinarian Dr Charles Hatcher said. ""However, the record heat this fall [2016] has allowed mosquitoes to endure. It's critical that livestock are current on annual vaccinations for year-round protection."" In addition to vaccinating livestock, residents should eliminate standing water, wear long sleeves and pants while outside, and apply insect repellent.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For county maps see:Kentucky: <http://geology.com/county-map/kentucky-county-map.gif> Logan and Union counties are in western KentuckyTennessee: <http://geology.com/county-map/tennessee-county-map.gif> Dyer, Gibson, and Chester counties are in western Tennessee.The warm autumn has seriously extended the normal mosquito season. - Mod.MHJ]
