El Norte de Castilla [in Spanish, trans. Katherine Soderholm, edited]<http://www.elnortedecastilla.es/valladolid/201605/05/junta-pone-marcha-protocolo-20160505164350.html>The Territorial Health Service of Castilla y LeÌ n in Valladolid has implemented the established protocol due to the detection of an outbreak of tuberculosis related to 'Raimundo de Blas' School in Arroyo de la Encomienda (Valladolid), as published previously.The implementation of this protocol, established for situations like this by both the program for prevention and control of tuberculosis in Castilla and LeÌ n and the national surveillance network, focuses on reducing the risks of new cases and early treatment for those who could be diagnosed. So far, 3 cases of tuberculosis have been diagnosed, including the alleged 'index case' and 1 more under surveillance. Public Health technicians are maintaining epidemiological surveillance as this outbreak evolves.Indeed, epidemiologists of the Territorial Health Service in Valladolid and members of the Pisuerga Pediatrics and Nursing Health Center, also located in Arroyo de la Encomienda, have held a meeting this morning with school staff and parents of students related to detected cases, to inform them of the measures taken in this situation, address doubts and questions, and calm any anxieties. Among these measures is the implementation of tuberculin tests, used for the detection of infection and possible need for other diagnostic studies, a process that takes time and comprehensive long-term monitoring.Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and is spread through the air from a person with pulmonary tuberculosis in the contagious phase by talking, coughing or sneezing. It can fundamentally affect the lungs but also other organs. TB infection is usually asymptomatic in healthy people, because their immune system acts to form a barrier around the bacterium.The symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis are coughing, sometimes with bloody sputum; chest pain; weakness; weight loss; fever and night sweats; and it is treated with antibiotics.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Valladolid, with a population of 309 714 people in 2013, is a city in northwestern Spain and the capital of the autonomous region of Castile and LeÌ n [Castilla y LeÌ n] (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid>).Raimundo de Blas Saz is a public school in Valladolid, under the Junta de Castilla y LeÌ n, which educates students from infancy to primary education (<http://ceipraimundodeblassaz.centros.educa.jcyl.es/sitio/>).The news report above says that 3 cases of tuberculosis (TB) have been diagnosed at the school, including the alleged 'index case' and 1 more under surveillance. The index case is commonly the 1st patient that indicates the existence of an outbreak. The index case may or may not be the source case, i.e., the patient responsible for transmitting infection to others. We are not told the ages of the 3 or 4 patients, but if children, they are unlikely to be source cases.TB is usually spread by inhaling aerosolized droplet nuclei, about 1-5 microns in diameter, that contain one or 2 tubercle bacilli (<http://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/corecurr/pdf/chapter2.pdf>). Droplet nuclei are expelled from a person with active pulmonary, especially cavitary, TB during activities such as coughing or sneezing; the airborne particles can remain suspended in the air for several hours, depending on the environment, and can be carried by air currents.Young children are thought to uncommonly generate infectious TB aerosols to readily transmit TB to their contacts. Consequently children usually are infected from exposure to an adult with active pulmonary TB in their immediate environment, usually in the household, but also at school (<http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-S1-S4>). Investigation for active pulmonary TB in adults who are contacts of TB infected children is the most important activity when investigating TB in children. Other children exposed to active TB must be evaluated for latent TB infection (LTBI); children with LTBI are at high risk for progressing to primary TB and its sequellae.ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on the Raimundo de Blas Saz TB outbreak in this regard from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1468>.]
