The ministry will then aim to scrap ordinances relating to testing, the officials said.However, testing will continue for any cattle of 24 months and older that are seen to move oddly.Japan diagnosed its 1st case of BSE, or mad cow disease, in September 2001. The following month, it banned the use of meat-and-bone meal and introduced blanket testing for all cattle regardless of age.The measures worked, bringing down national BSE infection rates significantly. The extent of BSE testing has been shrunk 3 times.Of the more than 1.6 million cows tested since 2001, 36 were found to have the disease. No cow has tested positive in Japan since January 2009.Since July 2013, only cattle aged more than 48 months have been required to be tested. This category accounts for 20 percent of cows slaughtered for human consumption in Japan.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Japan's 1st BSE case was detected in 2001; the total number of cases identified since is 36, peaking in 2006 (10 cases), with the most recent confirmed case reported in 2009.When BSE was 1st identified in Japan, this damaged consumers' confidence and caused a sharp fall in meat consumption; severe control measures followed. One of the suggested sources of infected material by which the infectious agent could have been introduced was contaminated milk replacers for the feeding of bovine offspring, imported from a European country. This hypothesis has remained pending confirmation. In most BSE-affected European countries, the detection of BSE in local (endemic) cattle started much earlier; e.g. UK (earlier than 1987), Ireland (1989), Switzerland (1990), France (1991), Portugal (1994), Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg (1997), etc. (OIE's BSE data at <http://tinyurl.com/jz44rgr>). Japan's severe BSE-related measures were behind the ban upon the import of beef from the USA, just hours after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the 1st BSE case in Washington state, December 2003. The ban on imports from the USA of beef from cattle 20 months of age and younger was lifted on 27 Jul 2006. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.]
