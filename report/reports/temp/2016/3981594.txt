In the 1980s these studies were used to create biological weapons, and this research was the foundation used to make the vaccine that was presented in January 2016.According to Professor Mikhail Schelkanov at the Far Eastern Federal University, who was among the 1st group of specialists sent to Guinea in the summer of 2014 to set up a microbiological center, geopolitics is the primary reason for the vaccine's creation.According to Schelkanov, ""Nigeria, with its high population density, is close to the epidemic's epicenter; meanwhile, the Boko Harem terrorist organization is active in the country. Essentially, this is the West African arm of the infamous Islamic State. If a biological weapon based on the Ebola virus falls into the hands of religious fanatics, the consequences for the world will be very serious. ""The Gamalei Institute vaccine was created not only with the help of Soviet-era military research, but also with material that we collected in the past 18 months in Guinea.""[It would be helpful if Russian scientists published their vaccine studies in a peer-reviewed journal. - Mod.LK]Funding---- 31 Jan 2016, Oxfam: USD1.9 billion in Ebola aid not delivered by donors <http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_EBOLA_DONOR_FAILURES?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-01-31-07-42-16>[According to the UK-based charity, Oxfam, as reported on Sunday [31 Jan 2016], international donors have failed to deliver USD 1.9 billion in promised funds to help West African countries recover from the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic which killed more than 11 000 people and decimated already weak health care systems, the U.K.-based charity Oxfam said Sun [31 Jan 2016]. In addition, Oxfam said the remaining USD 3.9 billion pledged has been difficult to track because of ""scant information"" and a lack of transparency.According to Aboubacry Tall, Oxfam's regional director for West Africa, ""We're finding it hard to understand which donors have given what money, to whom and for what purpose.][This seems to be a common problem when large sums of money are donated, whether it be a disease outbreak, a flood, or an earthquake, among other dire events. - Mod.LK][Compiled by Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A zoonotic niche map of the countries where cases have occurred in the field or been imported is at <http://healthmap.org/ebola>.
