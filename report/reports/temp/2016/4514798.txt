Public Health Insider [edited]<https://publichealthinsider.com/2016/09/08/two-patients-at-local-hospital-test-positive-for-legionnaires-disease/>It has been 11 days since UWMC [University of Washington Medical Center] implemented corrective actions and enhanced precautions to protect patients from _Legionella_, and no cases have occurred. Cases of _Legionella_ [infection] typically occur 2-10 days after exposure to the bacteria. Although it is possible additional cases will be identified, the absence of new cases suggests that the steps taken by UWMC to eliminate _Legionella_ transmission are working.Although the investigation is active and ongoing, and additional results are pending, available evidence currently points to the water system in the Cascade Tower building as the most likely source of the outbreak.Hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease has been reported from many hospitals since the 1st outbreak in 1976. Although cooling towers were linked to the cases of Legionnaires' disease in the years after its discovery, drinkable water has been the environmental source for almost all reported hospital outbreaks. Infection is acquired when patients inhale small droplets of water that are contaminated with _Legionella_, for example when drinking, consuming ice chips, showering, or using water in sinks.Heater-cooler devices are often necessary during surgeries to warm or cool patients as part of their care. Part of our investigation focused on whether these units could have contributed to the spread of _Legionella_ infection at UWMC because water and swabs from several of these units were found to have _Legionella_ growth when tested. At this time, we do not believe the heater-cooler units are linked to _Legionella_ transmission for a number of reasons:- Not all the cases had exposure to a heater cooler unit: Only 2 of the 4 cases had surgical procedures in which heater-cooler devices were used.- One type of heater-cooler unit, the Sorin 3T, has been confirmed in other hospitals in Europe and elsewhere in the United States (but not locally) as a source of infections with another type of bacteria called nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). These were not lung infections, and to-date there have been no confirmed reports of _Legionella_ transmission from this or any other heater-cooler model.- Among the 4 identified _Legionella_ cases at the UW to date, all were cared for in parts of the hospital where _Legionella_ was recovered from water samples.- Since _Legionella_ was detected in the UWMC Cascade Tower plumbing, ice machines and faucets, recovery of _Legionella_ from heater cooler units, which were filled with tap water and ice, is not surprising.- Patients are on breathing machines (ventilators) during surgery, and their air supply is protected and separate from the rest of the operating room air (where the heater cooler units are).- The timing of the onset of _Legionella_ infection in the 2 patients that did have surgery in which heater cooler units were used was well outside of the typical incubation period for _Legionella_ in one case and at the end of that period in the other.Although we do not believe the heater-cooler units are involved in transmission of Legionella at UWMC, steps have been taken at UWMC to eliminate the potential risk of _Legionella_ growth in these machines.[Byline: Meredith Li-Vollmer]--Communicated by:Jeffrey S.

Denis Green sent in a similar news report.The news report above says that only 2 of the 4 cases had surgical procedures in which heater-cooler devices were used and that if the heater-cooler machines were the source for their infection, the incubation periods are longer than the typical incubation period for Legionnaires' disease. In addition, in prior infections linked with heater-cooler devices, the pathogens were non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and the infections were endocarditis, aortic root abscess, sternal wound infection and disseminated NTM infection that followed cardiothoracic surgery.However, ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information from knowledgeable sources:- Did all 4 patients have Legionnaires' disease?- Did any of the 4 patients have extra-pulmonary legionellosis?- Was the _Legionella_ species in all 4 patients _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, and if so, do the genotypes match? (Matching would confirm a common source outbreak.)- What are the species of _Legionella_ isolated from the heater-cooler units, ice machine and 2 sinks?- If any of the _Legionella_ species from the environment are the same as the species of the clinical isolates, do their genotypes match? - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>.]
