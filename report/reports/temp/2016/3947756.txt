A monkeypox virus outbreak has struck the region.Information about the disease in Mbomou has been circulating the past few days, where 2 deaths were recorded and several patients were put in quarantine. The Ministry of Health confirmed the outbreak. Ms Marguerite Maliavo Samba said that tests and investigations carried out by her department confirmed the disease in Mbomou. The government official gave details on disease patterns of contamination, saying ""there are 2 modes of transmission of this disease. The 1st mode is transmission of contaminated living or dead animals to humans. The 2nd mode is from a sick or dead person to another healthy person in close contact with body fluids including blood, urine, vomit, sweat, semen, or by handling objects contaminated by secretions."" [This is extremely rare. - Mod.TY]The disease was detected for the 1st time in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is the 3rd time it has occurred in the Central African Republic. The 1st time was in Mbomou in 2001, and the 2nd time in Haute Kotto in 2014.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There have been human cases of monkeypox virus infection previously in the Central African Republic (CAR). Dr Mirdad Kazanji director of the Institut Pasteur at Bangui, reported that in June 2010, 2 boys aged 14 and 15 years were found to have diffuse maculopapular lesions associated with pustules and crusts (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111129.3488). They had been living in a settlement in the deep forest area of the southern CAR. The cases were reported to the Institut Pasteur at Bangui. The lesions developed after the boys had hunted and eaten a wild rodent (bemba). They both presented to a health centre one week after eruption of the extensive lesions, which covered the face, torso, and limbs. Both boys were systemically well, with no fever or notable lymphadenopathy.Dr Kazanji indicated that the phylogenetic tree showed that the 2010 strain was identical to the Democratic Republic of the Congo strain circulating in central Africa. This reported strain was identical to one associated with an outbreak of monkeypox in 2001 in a Bantu family living on the border between the CAR and the DRC, 480 km [about 300 miles] from the 2010 cases.It would be of interest to know to which clade the current monkeypox virus belongs, and which wild animals are the reservoirs in the Central African Republic.The USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their cooperators have been conducting field and laboratory studies to determine which rodent species are reservoirs of the virus. The virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance in the Republic of the Congo. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ sp.; an arboreal rodent), and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_.Maps of the Central African Republic can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/cen_african_rep_pol01.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34458>. - Mod.TY]
