Hawaii Public Radio [edited]<http://hawaiipublicradio.org/post/doh-hepatitis-outbreak-linked-frozen-scallops-genki-sushi>The Hawaii State Department of Health has ordered all Genki Sushi restaurants on Oahu and Kauai to close immediately. State health officials say imported frozen scallops served raw at Genki Sushi are likely linked to the hepatitis A outbreak that has infected 168 people since June 2016.""It's a likely cause at this point,"" said Department of Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo by phone. ""We need to complete the investigation, but to prevent any further illness, we have ordered the closure.""Okubo said health officials have determined an epidemiological link between a Genki Sushi restaurant and the current hepatitis A outbreak. It's not yet clear who distributes the frozen scallops and whether other Hawaii restaurants may be affected.[Byline: Molly Solomon]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Because of the prolonged period of time during which this outbreak is occurring (more than the incubation of hepatitis A), either the more recent cases were secondary household cases or the vehicle is one that has a more prolonged shelf life as in one being frozen. An epidemiological curve for the former would generally show a double hump pattern (with primary and secondary cases) while the latter would show no such hump.It is interesting that scallops have been implicated, since most of the time it only suggests that more than the adductor muscle was ingested (that is, the whole scallops, including the gastrointestinal tract) and that whatever was eaten was not cooked. If the whole scallop was not ingested, then contamination of the adductor muscle occurred during processing from the other parts of the scallop or from a food handler or water source.The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than that of oysters, because they are active swimmers; scallops are in fact the only migratory bivalve.
