Sher Bahadur Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]On 2 Aug 2016, a 5-year old boy (from Bagbazar, Kathmandu district) visited the outpatient department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) with complaints of fever, body ache, nausea and rashes. Maculopapular blisters and scabbed lesions were present in all parts of the body. About 4 weeks earlier, similar signs and symptoms were first noticed in one of his family members, who is believed to have contracted chickenpox in school (located in Imadol, Lalitpur district). Since then, 7 members of the same family have also had chickenpox. His elder brother (21-year old) is also currently under treatment at STIDH on an outpatient basis. Most studies have shown a higher occurrence of chickenpox cases during winter months, contrary to this report.--Communicated by:Dr.Sher Bahadur Pun, MD,PhDClinical Research UnitSukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease HospitalKathmanduNepal[ProMED thanks Dr.Sher Bahadur Pun for submitting the report on Varicella cases in Nepal.Varicella zoster virus or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is one of 8 herpesviruses known to infect humans and vertebrates. VZV only affects humans, and commonly causes chickenpox in children, teens and young adults and herpes zoster (shingles) in adults and rarely in children. VZV also is known as chickenpox virus, varicella virus, zoster virus, and human herpesvirus type 3 (HHV-3).Kathmandu climate is classified as subtropical wet forest biome. In temperate and most tropical climates, varicella has a distinct seasonal fluctuation, with the highest incidence occurring in winter and early spring. However, a study conducted in Australia, a temperate region, found that in contrast to published data from temperate zones elsewhere, varicella infection in Victoria and South Australia had a peak incidence in summer months with a smaller peak in early winter. While the geographical differences in varicella epidemiology remain to be investigated, it is possible that geographic segregation of VZV genotypes may account for some of the differences seen. Socio-cultural and environmental influences on the scheduling of school terms, holiday activities and other events involving the congregation of susceptible populations may provide a more feasible explanation <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016344530800087X>.Possibly for the same reasons, differences in seasonal activity may be occurring in Kathmandu.
