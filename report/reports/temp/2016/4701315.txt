The Hans India [edited]<http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Andhra-Pradesh/2016-12-15/Mystery-disease-playing-havoc-with-tribals-lives/268793>Many Adivasis [Adivasi is an umbrella term for a heterogeneous set of ethnic and tribal groups considered the Indigenous people population of South Asia. Adivasi make up 8.6 percent of India's population or 104 million, according to the 2011 census <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi> - Mod.LL] living in Bheemuguda, which is a stone's throw away distance from Utnoor, are suffering from a mysterious disease. In the village inhabited by about 50 families, several Adivasis are affected by it.For 4 months, one man has been suffering from the disease and complained that one of the legs appears as though it was burnt, while the other leg has been swollen. He complained of severe pain as though someone was pulling his legs. Afterwards, he stopped walking. Although he was treated at the primary health center at Dantanpalli, there was no improvement in his condition. Flesh [skin? - Mod.LL] began coming off on this right leg, which has had an appearance of being burnt. The leg is becoming thin. In sharp contrast, the left leg was swollen making it difficult for him to walk.He was taken to the RIMS hospital, where doctors prescribed him some medicines. But, there was no let up in the pain. His daughter is also suffering from pain in her fingers. He is suspecting that those who were hostile to his family subjected them to some witchcraft.There are many welfare schemes introduced by the state and central governments for the senior citizens. It was 3 decades ago that the Integrated Tribal Development Authority came into being. Health security appears to be a distant dream for the Adivasis. In many Adivasi villages, several people are suspected to have died of mysterious diseases. These Adivasis have been appealing to the authorities to save them from their superstitions and provide better medical care to them.[Byline: Madaavi Manik Rao]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[From the information given in this lay post, it is difficult to surmise what illness the gentleman has and, indeed, if his daughter suffers from the same affliction. More information is needed which should include what were the signs and symptoms of others also ill. Earlier in 2016, ProMED posted about an undiagnosed fatal illness associated with leg swelling in Andhra Pradesh which is the state just east of Telangana (Undiagnosed illness - India (06): (AP) fatal, leg swelling, RFI 20160926.4514923). Whether there is any relationship between these illnesses is totally unclear. ProMED would appreciate learning more information including results of any diagnostic testing.The states of India can be seen on a map at: <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/map-of-india-political.gif>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42348>.]
