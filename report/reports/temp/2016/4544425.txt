Z News, IANS report [edited]<http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/japanese-encephalitis-death-toll-rises-to-38-in-odisha_1937426.html>The death toll due to Japanese encephalitis has reached 38 in Odisha's Malkangiri district while the disease continues to spread its tentacles to other districts.An 11-year-old boy of Bengama village in Brahmagiri area of Puri district died on Thursday [6 Oct 2016] after contracting the vector-borne disease.""As many as 105 persons have been afflicted by Japanese encephalitis, out of which 25 persons have been cured,"" said Health Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak.He said: ""Some doctors are camping in Malkangiri district, while some paediatricians will visit the affected areas to take stock of the situation.""Meanwhile, Union Minister of State [MoS] for Petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan has met Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda to discuss how to prevent the spread of disease.""The Health minister has assured to extend all possible support for identifying the causes of the disease and advise the state government regarding the effective steps for combating the clinical fallout of its spread and preventing the mortality associated with it,"" said Pradhan.The MoS also urged Nadda to send a high-level fact-finding team to investigate the causes for the outbreak of the disease and suggest preventive measures to contain the same.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case numbers related to this outbreak are a bit confusing in that we have received 2 other reports today (7 Oct 2016) indicating that the death toll is 32. In either situation, the number of fatalities in this area continues to increase. Health officials are becoming concerned with this trend and have focused preventive efforts on village pigs. Another report received today (7 Oct 2016) stated that the government is considering culling village pigs in an attempt to halt Japanese encephalitis virus transmission. No other information was provided. The presence of pigs in villages of the district is a reasonable worry, since pigs are amplifying hosts of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus. However, it seems curious that in all these recent reports no mention is made of vaccination. That would be the most effective measure for prevention of JE in this susceptible population.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>. - Mod.TY]
