AllAfrica, The Observer (Kampala) report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201604290595.html>The health ministry is to conduct a free yellow fever vaccination campaign for all people at risk in [Uganda's] Masaka and Rukungiri, districts where the disease has been confirmed.3 people with yellow fever have been admitted at Masaka regional referral hospital for treatment while one is at Kebisoni health centre IV in Rukungiri, forcing the government to intervene.""Procurement of vaccines is nearing completion and the vaccination exercise is expected to begin next month [May 2016]. This exercise is targeting people aged 6 months and above,"" a ministry statement said yesterday [28 Apr 2016].According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccination is the major preventative measure against the disease because it is highly effective, generally safe and relatively cheap.Currently, the vaccines are available at 4 recognized health facilities in the country and they come at a cost. These are: KCCA health centre IV at the City Hall, Norvic hospital, Kazuri clinic at Entebbe international airport and The Surgery in Naguru.Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the director general of Health Services, also advises people to always sleep under a mosquito net to prevent the disease. Yellow fever is an acute viral infection transmitted by infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Some of those infected can develop a high fever and jaundice resulting in yellowing of the eyes and skin.Meanwhile, the population of stranded travelers without yellow fever vaccination certificates continues to soar at the Busia border post in eastern Uganda as Kenyan and Ugandan authorities continue to turn away people without proof of vaccination.Scores have camped at the immigration office on the Ugandan and Kenyan sides for the last 2 weeks awaiting vaccination or expiry of the mandatory 10 days of no travel after the vaccination.[Byline: Racheal Ninsiima]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Cross-border movement in either direction requires proof of yellow fever (YF) vaccination. In Kenya, there are 4 vaccination posts, and there is an unspecified charge for the vaccination. In Uganda, apparently the vaccination will be without charge. A 21 Apr 2016 report indicates that hundreds of passengers have been stranded at the border posts for lack of the certificates. Some were forced to return to Nairobi to pick up the documents following a directive by the Health Ministry that all travellers in and out of the country must possess the certificates. Business people heading to different foreign countries have incurred huge losses because they could not make it to their destinations (<http://allafrica.com/stories/201604220714.html>). Other reports indicated that as the numbers of people have accumulated along the border for days, bribery and the issuing of false vaccination certificates have been occurring. This is a very serious situation and must be stopped at once.Sleeping under under a mosquito net at night won`t help because the urban yellow fever mosquito only bites by day.  Nets will, however, protect the bedridden and those who who have to go to bed in daytime, such as children, night staff and people in their homes ill from other causes like malaria.  Nets will also protect hospital staff from getting bitten by infected mosquitoes.Consideration should be given to spraying aerosol  insecticide inside cross-border ground and air traffic before arrival from an infected country  This is apparently not being done at Uganda`s forested SW borders with Rwanda & Congo DR, but should be done there and also at the Uganda-Kenya border. The vaccination campaigns in Uganda's Masaka and Rukungiri districts, where outbreaks are occurring, were earlier stated to begin this week [last week of April 2016] but have been postponed until next month [May 2016], with no specific dates given. Apparently the vaccine has not been procured yet.  When it is, hopefully there will be authorization and enough syringes of the smaller size to conserve vaccine supplies by using only 1/10th of a dose which has been shown to be effective.Every day's delay brings the risk of more cases, deaths, orphans and spread to other localities in Uganda and beyond.
