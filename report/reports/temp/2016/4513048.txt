The remaining case reported in Tchindjenje district in Huambo province is under investigation;- phase II of the vaccination campaign has been prepared and will begin shortly in 12 districts in 9 provinces.Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) epidemiological update (as of 18 Sep [2016]):- the last confirmed non-sylvatic case had symptom onset on 12 Jul [2016];- 9 new cases are under investigation, 8 in Kinshasa province, and one in Lingomono Health Zone in Tshuapa province. A total of 12 cases are under investigation including the 1st notified case reported in Sud Ubangi province in Bominenge Health Zone (reported in the situation report of 26 Aug [2016]).- the reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi and Mushenge Health Zones in Kwango province will begin soon.Republic of Congo is planning a pre-emptive vaccination campaign.AnalysisThe continuing detection and investigation of suspected and laboratory positive cases demonstrate that active surveillance is functioning well in some areas. Nevertheless, it is important to note the inherent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation capacities. It remains possible that detection of a case could be delayed in some remote areas. A strong and sustained surveillance effort is therefore more crucial than ever.Epidemiological situationAngola3 of the 4 laboratory positive cases reported in the last situation report have been discarded as having recent vaccination history. The remaining case is under investigation.From 5 Dec 2015-15 Sep 2016 (Fig. 1, Table 1 [figures and tables are available at the source URL above]):- 4120 suspected cases, with 373 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR [case fatality rate] : 9.1 percent);- 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 percent).Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces (Table 2). Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces.Luanda and Huambo provinces have reported the highest number of total cases. As of [15 Sep 2016], 2082 cases including 488 confirmed cases have been reported in Luanda and 642 cases including 128 confirmed cases have been reported in Huambo.Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)From 1 Jan-18 Sep 2016 (Fig. 2, Table 1):- 2770 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces;- 76 confirmed cases have been identified from 2345 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 percent);- of the 76 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces (Fig. 4), 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous, and 6 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak).9 new cases are under investigation, 8 in Kinshasa province and one in Lingomono Health Zone in Tshuapa province. A total of 12 cases are under investigation including the 1st notified case reported in Sud Ubangi province in Bominenge Health Zone. Sud Ubangui province, which borders the Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic, reported the potential case for the 1st time in the week to 25 Aug [2016].The 13 autochthonous cases were reported from 10 Health Zones in 3 provinces: Kinshasa (6 cases), Kongo Central (2 cases), and Kwango (5 cases).The most affected age group among men is 25 to 29 years of age (0.53 per 100 000) and 35 to 39 years of age among women (0.16 per 100 000) (Fig. 3).ResponseInformation on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website.In Angola, phase II of the vaccination campaign has been prepared and will begin shortly in 12 districts in nine provinces (Fig. 5).In DRC, the 10 day reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi and Mushenge Health Zones in Kwango province will begin soon.WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to DRC and Angola through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile and with additional vaccines from Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.As of 20 Sep 2016, 20.0 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for DRC (Table 3).The number of vaccines currently available for the emergency response is 5.7 million through the ICG (Table 4). The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Republic of the Congo's (Brazzaville) plan to pre-emptively vaccinate is prudent, since there has been active yellow fever (YF) virus transmission just across the river in Kinshasa of the DRC. There are 8 suspected YF cases in Kinshasa under investigation currently. Continuation of YF vaccination and intensified surveillance in Angola and the DRC is a good strategy in case there are undetected foci of transmission in more remote areas that have not been detected yet. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo and R Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>]
