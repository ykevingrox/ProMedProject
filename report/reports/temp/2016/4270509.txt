New Vision [edited]<http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1426252/yellow-fever-vaccination-kicks-kalangala>After a long wait for vaccination materials, yellow fever vaccination has started in all health centres in [Kalangala] district. Some locations have also been set up by the district health department for the exercise. As many as 54 000 people, starting from the age of 6 months, will be vaccinated.2 people were reported dead in 2 villages of Kalangala following the outbreak of yellow fever in the districts of Masaka [Central region], Rukungiri [Western region], and Kalangala [Central region].The vaccination exercise is expected to be over by Monday next week [13 Jun 2016] said Rose Tumusiime, a medic at Kalangala health center 1V. ""For all those that will miss out, it will be their responsibility to look for somewhere and be vaccinated. This exercise is free of charge but whoever misses out will have to pay for the vaccine,"" she said.Hillary Bitakaramire, the Kalangala district health officer [DHO] urged people to use this opportunity as the cost of yellow fever vaccination is very high in private health facilities. ""This vaccine costs about sh 100 000 Ugandan shilling [USD 30] in a private center so I call upon people even though they have a lot of work to do to spare some time and come to be vaccinated. Also, vaccination is for their benefit,"" said the DHO.[byline: Denis Mubiru]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is good to learn that the yellow fever (YF) vaccine is now available without cost to the vaccinees and the campaign is ready to begin throughout Kalangala district. One hopes that the campaign, which will last just a week, will achieve 80 per cent or more coverage of the district's population when the free vaccine is available. The limited time for the campaign will require an intensive public information effort prior to and during the campaign. Perhaps the prospect of having to purchase the vaccine if one misses out during the campaign will provide an incentive for individuals to comply during the week that the vaccine is free.The complication that the unavailability of free vaccine may pose is that, if less than 80 per cent of the population is covered, the relative high cost of purchased vaccine may discourage individuals from being vaccinated, leaving the unvaccinated component of the population at risk of infection. Should that create a situation where an outbreak could occur, halting transmission poses a public health, and ultimately expensive challenge. An outbreak is far better to prevent than to halt.
