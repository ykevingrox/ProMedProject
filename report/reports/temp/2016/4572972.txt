A man in Wichita Falls was recently diagnosed with tularemia - also known as Rabbit Fever. Health officials say it's a rare bacterial infection for this area that comes from tick and deer fly bites, skin contact with infected animals like rabbits and rats, and ingesting contaminated water.The Wichita Falls Health Department says they spoke to the man and got some background information including any contact he had with rodents or rabbits and any travel he did to areas in the USA that have the disease.Symptoms of the disease are normally flu-like - fever, swollen glands and general discomfort. Health officials say they are not sure how he got the disease. They will be meeting shortly to review the case. He told them he had accidentally run over some rabbits while mowing his yard and health officials say he may have come into contact that way.""The thing that we really want to impress on people - even if this isn't a local transmission - we have the rodent issue this year. There are a lot of rabbits in the area. So if you have a dead animal in your yard do not to handle that with your hands. Be sure to use a plastic bag, a shovel and to put that in the trash and be sure to wash your hands good if you come into contact with any dead animal.""Tularemia can be deadly if the symptoms aren't caught early and the disease progresses. Health department officials say the good news is it can be treated with antimicrobials. The disease cannot be transmitted from person to person - only animal to person. You have to have some contact with either a tick or fly bite or an infected animal.According to family members, the Wichita Falls man with the disease has been transferred to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas for further treatment.[Byline: Ava Van Valen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. In this case, aerosolization of organisms from the rabbits being run over may have caused tularemia pneumonia. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _Francisella tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1). A good review of the subject written by Thomas and Schaffner can be found in reference 2.References1. Foshay L: Cause of death in tularemia. Arch Intern Med. 1937;60: 22-38.2. Thomas LD, Schaffner W: Tularemia pneumonia. Infect Dis N Am 2010;24: 43-55.According to CDC data (<https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/index.html>), only 4 cases of tularemia were reported from Texas in the 10 year period from 2005 to 2014. Wichita Falls is located in Wichita county in north Texas, bordering on Oklahoma (in which 122 cases were reported in the same time period) and can be found on a map at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_Falls,_Texas#/media/File:Wichita_County_WichitaFalls.svg> - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
