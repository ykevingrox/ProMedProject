The News Minute (TNM) [edited]<http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/fungus-found-saline-bottle-hyderabads-state-run-niloufer-hospital-46111>Even as 7 people lost vision in one eye after a botched-up cataract surgery in Hyderabad's [Telangana] Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital (SDEH), another hospital in the city was in trouble on [Thu 7 Jul 2016], after fungus was found in a bottle of saline solution. The saline [that] was found in the city's Niloufer Hospital was supplied by the same company that supplied the saline to the SDEH.The Times of India [TOI] reported:Nagpur-based Haseeb Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, which supplied RL solution bottles to both the hospitals, is in trouble with Telangana Drugs Control Administration (DCA) seizing 28 000 bottles of the saline from state-run Niloufer Hospital on [Thu 7 Jul 2016]. The contents of the seized bottles have been sent for analysis.""These samples would be tested for both bacterial and fungal elements. In case of bacteria detection, it would take a week's time, while in case of fungal elements, it would take 15 days for the report to come,"" drug inspector K Anvesh told TOI.Many are now demanding that the Nagpur firm be blacklisted. The hospital has made other arrangements for saline after the DCA seized the bottles.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 7 Jul 2016Source: Nagpur Today [edited]<http://www.nagpurtoday.in/nagpurs-haseeb-pharma-refutes-charges-of-contaminated-solution-blinding-7-in-hyderabad/07071801>Even as the doctors at government-run Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital in Hyderabad passed the buck on Nagpur-based Haseeb Pharmaceuticals for the lost vision of 7 cataract patients, back home the company has rubbished the claims and termed it as negligence on the part of doctors. Even a report published in Indian Express supported the company's claims as it quoted hospital sources as saying that the medicines were not contaminated and that contamination took place inside the operation theatre. Meanwhile a case has been registered against doctors.It may be mentioned that 7 people who underwent cataract surgery at the Hyderabad based hospital had lost their vision in at least one eye after botched-up surgeries. 21 people had been operated on [30 Jun 2016] for cataract, of which 13 contracted infection in their eyes. They complained of unbearable pain and pus formation in their eye as well as incessant vomiting soon after the surgery, and were immediately taken for re-surgery. However, the matter came to light on [Wed 8 Jul 2016] when 7 people complained that they had still not recovered their vision.Talking to Nagpur Today, Managing Director of Haseeb Pharmaceuticals Yusuf Badar claimed that all the products that are manufactured and bottled undergo a series of quality control [procedures]. The stringent quality controls exist at the 3 levels, one during the production, before bottling/packing, at the warehouse, etc. He added that even before a good is supplied to any hospital, a test is carried by a laboratory and only when the test results come clear is the good supplied.Yusuf Badar said that during investigations, it had come to fore that the product was cleared for supply by the local laboratory, which performed tests on the product.The hospital records revealed that it had a stock of 540 bottles of RL solution at the time of the incident, all of which were procured from Haseeb Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd. The doctors said that the saline was used for washing the eyes of patients during surgery.However, one major point that clears the name of Haseeb Pharmaceuticals is that the saline solution, which was supplied was for intravenous use and is clearly mentioned in the label of the product.Even if the doctors have to use it for flushing (during surgeries), they are supposed to mix it (with antibiotics, etc.) in a technique known as aseptic technique. This technique is a method designed to prevent contamination from microorganisms and involves applying the strictest rules and utilizing what is known about infection prevention to minimize the risks of an infection. This technique was probably not followed by the hospital authorities.Andhra Pradesh government has also constituted a committee to conduct an enquiry into the botched up surgeries, while Health Minister C Laxma Reddy said his government will take action against the supplier.This isn't the 1st time that such an incident has occurred at the hospital. 3 years earlier, bacteria contamination in saline was blamed for an infection that affected about 15 people, reported The Hindu.Yusuf Badar also alleged that there have been previous similar cases reported of the hospital. He added that the hospital authorities do not sterilize the equipment, do not autoclave the essential equipment used in such a sensitive part.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Endophthalmitis is a bacterial or fungal infection inside the eye involving the vitreous and/or aqueous humors. Endophthalmitis can either be exogenous or endogenous: exogenous endophthalmitis occurs after a pathogen enters the eye from an external source, such as a contaminated irrigation solution, injection, intraocular lens implant, or piece of surgical equipment. Most cases of exogenous endophthalmitis occur as a complication of eye surgery or other invasive eye procedures, such as intravitreal injections. Exogenous endophthalmitis in general is very rare, occurring as a complication of cataract surgery in less than 0.1 percent of patients (<http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/media/pdf/AudioRounds_FE.pdf>). Endogenous endophthalmitis follows hematogenous dissemination of a pathogen to the eye.In exogenous endophthalmitis after cataract surgery, the usual source of the pathogen is the patient's own local microflora. In the USA and Europe, nearly all cases are caused by bacteria -- coagulase-negative staphylococci being the most common cause of post-cataract endophthalmitis, whereas in India, 10-20 percent of cases are caused by fungi for unknown reasons (Gupta A, Gupta V, Gupta A, et al: Spectrum and clinical profile of post cataract surgery endophthalmitis in north India. Indian J Ophthalmol. 2003; 51(2):139-45; available at <http://www.ijo.in/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2003;volume=51;issue=2;spage=139;epage=145;aulast=Gupta>).Exogenous endophthalmitis occurring after cataract surgery is a devastating complication. It is a medical emergency, because delayed or inadequate therapy may lead to irreversible loss of vision. The most important component of treatment is the intravitreal injection of antibiotics, along with vitrectomy in severe cases.The organism or organisms involved in the current outbreak in India are not stated. If the same species is isolated from both clinical specimens and the saline solutions, then genotyping the isolates can be used to establish that the contaminated saline is at fault.More information on what fungal pathogen(s) are involved, if the same pathogens are involved at both hospitals, if other medical centers are involved in this outbreak, if the saline solution was contaminated prior to distribution to the hospitals, and how the fungal contamination occurred and went unnoticed would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/43630>.Telangana is one of the 29 states in southern India, with the city of Hyderabad as its capital (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana>).
