Reporte EpidemiolÌ gico de CÌ rdoba [in Spanish, trans KS, edited]<http://www.reporteepidemiologico.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/REC-1736.pdf>Brazilian regions oriented towards ecologically sustainable tourism -- or ecotourism -- and apparently healthy, could favor the transmission of the parasite _Schistosoma mansoni_, which causes schistosomiasis, a chronic disease that affects the urinary or digestive systems.Researchers at the 'Evandro Chagas' Institute and the Foundation of the 'Oswaldo Cruz' Institute (FIOCRUZ), among others, analyzed 2 outbreaks of schistosomiasis in the state of Minas Gerais, in southeastern Brazil, identifying an infection rate of 59% among 34 individuals who bathed in natural water sources in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, the state capital. The symptoms included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. More detailed examinations noted the presence of parasite eggs in the feces of the patients.To analyze the 2nd outbreak, they collected 24 snails in the area of the Sierra del CipÌ  National Park, where a family had been exposed, noting that 2 snails eliminated larvae of the parasite _S. mansoni_.Exposure to contaminated water triggers different types of infections among residents of endemic areas and tourists traveling to those areas.The disease is transmitted by contact with fresh water, often in places without sanitation services, which are more likely to be contaminated with parasitic larvae.Upon contact with water, _S. mansoni_ eggs release larvae that breed in several species of snails. (In the study, researchers studied the snail _Biomphalaria glabrata_, which is endemic to the region.) Subsequently, the larvae return to the water, where they infect other persons by penetrating the skin, traveling through the bloodstream to reach the liver.The immune response to the parasite in tourists is different from that in residents of endemic areas, causing more severe symptoms among those first exposed to the parasite. ""Therefore, schistosomiasis is no longer just a rural disease, but rather peri-urban,"" said biologist Ronaldo Scholte, consultant to the Ministry of Health of Brazil.""The study reinforces the importance of health surveillance in those regions and reminds authorities that ecotourism provides benefits but also the risk of spreading disease,"" he said.For Eduardo Finger, of the faculty of Medical Sciences of Santa Casa de SÌ£o Paulo, the emergence of new foci of transmission is not the fault of ecotourism, but the consequence of environmental phenomena associated with poverty and lack of basic hygiene in many regions of the country.""There are cases of transmission in SÌ£o Paulo and new sources of transmission in Rio Grande do Sul. The problem is that when the disease is installed in an area, it is very difficult to remove,"" he said.In Brazil, the disease causes 1% of deaths from infectious diseases. Globally, there are 200 million people infected, according to the WHO.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Schistosomiasis is a risk from contact with fresh water in Brazil, and has been described before from Minas Gerais, related to tourism (Enk MJ, Amorim A, Schall VT: Acute schistosomiasis outbreak in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais: alert about the risk of unnoticed transmission increased by growing rural tourism.

Both the local population and tourists should be advised to avoid swimming in fresh water, like lakes and rivers. - Mod.
