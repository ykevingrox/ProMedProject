ECDC [edited]<http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?ID=1422&List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&Source=http%3A%2F%2Fecdc%2Eeuropa%2Eeu%2Fen%2FPages%2Fhome%2Easpx>ECDC has updated its rapid risk assessment on the outbreak of yellow fever with the latest developments, more comprehensive information on the current situation in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda, and an extended threat assessment for the EU. Some of the data used in the assessment were collected during a mission to Angola in May 2016.Current situationFrom 21 Jan - 22 May 2016, the Angolan Ministry of Health notified 2536 yellow fever cases, of which 747 were confirmed and 301 fatal. The number of new suspected and confirmed cases in Angola has been decreasing, and a mass vaccination campaign has already reached about half of the targeted population. However, the outbreak in Angola is not yet under control and is currently expanding to additional provinces, further challenging the ongoing mass vaccination campaign. Currently, all regions in Angola should be considered as areas at high risk of transmission of yellow fever.The yellow fever outbreak in Uganda is unrelated to the outbreak in Angola. Between 26 Mar - 19 May 2016, health authorities reported 60 yellow fever cases, including 7 deaths in 6 different districts.As of 23 May 2016, DRC has reported 590 cases of yellow fever, 41 of these had a recent travel history to Angola.Viraemic patients travelling to areas where suitable vectors and susceptible human populations are present pose a risk for local transmission. Such areas exist in most of the inter-tropical zones of Africa and the Americas and Asia. Therefore, the risk of international spread within Africa and beyond is currently high.In the EU/EEA, the risk of yellow fever virus being introduced is limited to unvaccinated viraemic travellers coming from areas with active local transmission. Given that outbreaks of yellow fever in urban settings have the potential for rapid spread and that significant yellow fever epidemics are ongoing in Angola, DRC and Uganda, a range of options for response by EU/EEA Member States are presented in the updated rapid risk assessment. These options emphasize the importance of vaccination of travellers and those leaving Angola, preventive measures against mosquito bites in affected areas, as well as awareness raising among clinicians to consider this diagnosis in returning travellers.Read the rapid risk assessment: Rapid risk assessment: Outbreaks of yellow fever in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, 1st update.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The case counts for Angola and Uganda are the same as those posted by the latest WHO situation report (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160528.4250752). The number of cases reported from the Congo DR has increased from 453 suspected on 2 May 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160502.4197790) to 590 cases reported above. It is not stated whether these 590 are suspected or confirmed cases or whether they are locally acquired within the Congo DR. This apparent increase is of considerable concern. Previous reports indicated that there were just 3 locally acquired cases. Local YF transmission raises serious questions about the response in the Congo DR, and whether there is sufficient vaccine to cover a large proportion of the population. For a discussion of the vaccine situation, ProMED-mail subscribers are encouraged to read <http://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/24/107/full/#.V04OdIQrLIU>, written by ProMED-mail co-founder Jack Woodall.International help is being provided in the Congo DR by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Matadi, the capital of Kongo Central, MSF teams on 26 May 2016 launched a vaccination campaign intended for its 350 000 residents, as part of the Congolese Ministry of Health (MoH) programme aimed at a target population of 2 million people. This single program covers 2 health districts in Kinshasa and 9 health districts in Kongo Central (<http://www.msf.org/en/article/angola-drc-msf-teams-help-curb-yellow-fever>). One hopes that surveillance in the Congo DR is adequate to detect new cases, especially in new locations, so that a timely response is possible.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the locations of the African countries mentioned can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3948>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Historical overviewDate: Sun 17 April 2016From: Steve Berger <steve@gideononline.com> [edited][It is easy to forget the significant and adverse social and economic impacts that previous yellow fever outbreaks have inflicted on society. Understanding them provides context for the concern the current YF outbreak in Africa is generating. The following summary provides an interesting overview of past outbreaks. - Mod.TY]Infectious diseases continually shape human history, often through their impact on leaders in science, politics, war, religion, industry and art. The death of a king, president or pope from plague or malaria can affect us all and serves as a useful paradigm in the appreciation of these conditions. For many, yellow fever (YF) remains a ""rare tropical disease"" which (as in the current Angolan outbreak) periodically erupts in the developing world. Few realize that major YF outbreaks were recorded in the United States, Spain, Italy and even England into the early 20th century. A chronology of outbreaks beyond the tropics appears below.A list of notables who died of YF includes Benjamin Latrobe, the architect who designed the United States Capitol Building, and Henry Lehman, the financier who founded Lehman Brothers. Both contracted the disease in New Orleans, respectively, in 1820 and 1855. Heads of state who died of YF included Haitian president Alexandre Petion (died 1818) and Thomas Dundas, governor of Guadeloupe (died 1794). Non-fatal attacks appear in the biographies of American president Zachary Taylor, Texas president Anson Jones and Chilean Supreme Director, Bernardo O'Higgins.Other victims of YF included Cyrus McCormick, Thomas Nast, Donald Meek, John James Audubon and Alexander Selkirk. McCormick, inventor of the mechanical reaper, acquired the infection in Virginia at the age of 5. Nast, a legendary political cartoonist, was stricken in Ecuador in 1902; and Meek an iconic character actor, was rendered permanently bald after surviving yellow fever during the Spanish American War. Audubon survived an attack of YF in 1803, after emigrating to Philadelphia from Haiti. That year, outbreaks of the disease were reported in both. Alexander Selkirk, the Scottish castaway who served as inspiration for Robinson Crusoe, died of YF during navy service in West Africa (1721). Indeed, military activity often exposes famous people to ""exotic"" diseases. Thus, British war hero Horatio Nelson suffered a nonfatal attack of YF in Cuba in 1780; and Samuel Nicholas, 1st Commander of the United States Marines, died during an outbreak in Philadelphia in 1790. A number of former Civil War Generals succumbed to the disease, including Charles Griffin (1867), Cyrus Hamlin (1867), John Bell Hood (1879) and Edward Ord (1883).To date, over 500 health-care workers have died during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and it is no surprise that several notable victims of yellow fever have been scientists working with the disease itself. Physicians John Conrad Otto, Philip Syng Physick and Benjamin Rush all survived attacks of YF while working in Philadelphia. Medical personnel who died of YF included doctors Jesse Willam Lazear (1900) and James Carroll (1907), and nurse Clara Maass (1901), who succumbed after purposely exposing themselves to the bites of infected mosquitoes in Cuba. Other physicians who died of YF (country - year of death) included Francois Carlo Antommarchi (Cuba - 1838), personal physician to Napoleon Bonaparte; Richard Bayley (New York -1801), the 1st Chief Health Officer of New York City; and Paul A. Lewis (Brazil - 1929). In 1928, Hideo Noguchi and William Alexander Young both died of yellow fever while studying the disease in Ghana.Notable victims of yellow fever have also included 3 painters, a chess master, 4 authors/journalists, and 2 co-conspirators in the Lincoln assassination.

Fortunately, many localities today do not support the abundant populations of _Aedes aegypti_ necessary to trigger a YF outbreak. However, when one considers those areas where this vector mosquito population is present and transmitting dengue viruses, the specter of initiation of YF outbreaks is real, and contingency plans should be in place. - Mod.TY]
