The Safe Drinking Water Act requires that all medium to large Public Water Suppliers in the US test for lead and other metals at a regular frequency.--Steve RhodeMassachusetts Water Resources Authority<steve.rhode@mwra.com>[While the Safe Drinking Water Act requires that all medium to large public water suppliers in the USA test for lead and other metals at regular frequency, it appears to completely leave out small towns which may not have the financial means to test and consequently may not be testing. If they are testing then are they notifying their residents in a timely fashion?While levels are set by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the notification of problems seems a bit tardy. For example, the Act states that public education is by poster or pamphlet within 60 days of exceeded limits. 60 days is a long time to drink contaminated water. The article in the previous ProMED-mail post indicates several cities having problems with lead, but in Flint, Michigan, it seems that it was likely as long or perhaps longer than 60 days.Furthermore, an article in the New York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/us/regulatory-gaps-leave-unsafe-lead-levels-in-water-nationwide.html?_r=0> states: ""In Sebring, Ohio, routine laboratory tests last August [2015] found unsafe levels of lead in the town's drinking water after workers stopped adding a chemical to keep lead water pipes from corroding. Five months passed before the city told pregnant women and children not to drink the water, and shut down taps and fountains in schools.""The article continues: ""In 2001, after Washington DC changed how it disinfected drinking water, lead in tap water at thousands of homes spiked as much as 20 times the federally approved level. Residents did not find out for 3 years. When they did, officials ripped out lead water pipes feeding 17 600 homes and discovered 3 years later that many of the repairs had only prolonged the contamination.""Please note that it says 5 months, and 3 years far exceeds the 60 days the SDWA requires for notification.This same article states: ""Unsafe levels of lead have turned up in tap water in city after city -- in Durham and Greenville, North Carolina in 2006; in Columbia, South Carolina in 2005; and last July 2015 in Jackson Miss [presumably Mississippi. - Mod.SH], where officials waited 6 months to disclose the contamination -- as well as in scores of other places in recent years.""So while there may be requirements, are municipalities effectively notifying residents and taking action when the levels are outside of recommended bounds? Is corrective action being taken in a timely fashion? Articles like the above suggest that there is a problem. Regardless of what the SDWA says, it appears that not everyone is following the rules, certainly when it comes to notifying those consuming the water.While the Act may specify levels, are labs testing to those levels? People may need to consider what is being done in their municipalities and to become actively involved in their local government issues that impact their personal health. Regardless of what the Act says, there appear to be towns and regions where lead in water is an ongoing problem. - Mod.TG][See Also:Lead, water - USA (04): schools 20160413.4157719Lead, water - USA (03): (NY) 20160305.4071887Lead, water - USA (02): (MI) 20160130.3980556Lead, water - USA: (MI) 20160126.3965610].................................................tg/msp/sh"
