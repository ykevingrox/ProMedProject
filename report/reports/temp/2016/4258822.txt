Marin Independent Journal [edited]<http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20160526/NEWS/160529839>Two young children including a 2-year-old Fairfax (CA) [in Marin County, north of San Francisco - Mod.LL] resident, have been diagnosed with a toxin-producing form of _E. coli_, and Marin public health officials are investigating the possibility that the source of the bacteria was a creek that runs through Peri Park in downtown Fairfax. A 3rd child, a 3-year-old San Anselmo resident, has also displayed symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of _E. coli_, but tests results are still pending. The 2nd confirmed _E. coli_ case is a 3-year-old resident of Truckee. All 3 children played in Peri Park's Fairfax Creek not long before becoming ill.""We have not yet confirmed that water contamination is the source,"" said Dr. Lisa Santora, Marin County's deputy public health officer. Rebecca Ng, deputy director of Marin County's environmental health department, said, ""We took water samples this morning."" Test results from those samples weren't available Thu 26 May 2016; but Santora said they will show only whether there is coliform bacteria in the creek, not whether the type of _E. coli_ that caused these illnesses is present there. Coliform bacteria are found in the intestinal tract of humans and other animals.Fairfax Town Manager Garrett Toy said the creek is polluted from storm drain runoff and could contain feces from dogs, deer or other animals. ""It's a creek; there is always going to be bacteria in the creek,"" Toy said. ""You really shouldn't be consuming water from the creek even if it is by accident.""Santora said the Truckee child was the 1st to become ill and was hospitalized 8-9 May 2016 at Marin General Hospital. The Fairfax child became ill on 15 May, and the San Anselmo child became ill on 21 May. Neither of the Marin County children has been hospitalized. Santora said she didn't have current information on the medical condition of any of the children.The illnesses have caused a flurry of postings on the social media site Nextdoor. According to 1 posting, the Truckee child was transferred to the University of California at Davis Medical Center in Sacramento after his kidneys began to fail and is responding well to intravenous therapy and blood transfusions. Santora confirmed that the child is now at UC Davis Medical Center; but she couldn't confirm whether any of the children have developed a potentially life-threatening complication involving the kidneys, known as hemolytic-uremic syndrome.The symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ or EHEC - Mod.LL] include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), vomiting and sometimes fever. Most people recover within 5 to 7 days. Santora said the illness is more dangerous in young children than healthy adults. While Fairfax Creek is highly suspect, health officials are also looking into the possibility the children were exposed to the bacteria through something they ate. The Fairfax child consumed raw cream before becoming ill, and the San Anselmo child ate at a Marin restaurant, Ng said.Santora said health department employees have conducted a visual inspection of the stretch of the creek the children were playing in and found no evidence of people camping along the creek or unapproved sewage systems. Ross Valley Sanitary District director Frank Egger said that after he heard about the illnesses he confirmed that the sanitary district has had no recent spills in the Fairfax Creek watershed.The county's environmental health department regularly tests the water at a number of Marin beaches, including the swimmable pools along Lagunitas Creek in Samuel P. Taylor State Park. If levels exceed state water standards, warning signs are posted. The California Department of Public Health advises beachgoers not to enter the water where warning signs are posted. Signs are currently posted at the Inkwells, at Lagunitas Creek in West Marin, and have been since 9 May 2016 due to unsafe levels of _E. coli_.Ng said the water in Fairfax Creek is not tested, however, because people do not bathe there regularly. Regardless of the test results on the Fairfax Creek water samples taken, Ng said her department won't post the typical beach warning signs in Peri Park. Toy said Fairfax is designing its own signs. ""I'm not sure what the wording is going to be yet,"" he said. ""The reality is people just need to be mindful, don't drink the water.""[Byline: Richard Halstead]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The serotype(s) of EHEC in this series of cases with an epidemiological link to a creek in a northern California park is not reported.Water for drinking, from wells or even municipal water sources, as well as recreational water for swimming has been sources for enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. With wells, especially if they are not well constructed, the water can be contaminated with fecal material from the animal hosts of the zoonotic bacillus. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, and other livestock or wild animals. - Mod.LL][A county map can be seen at <http://geology.com/county-map/california-county-map.gif>. - CopyEd.AOA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
