WHO Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/28-april-2016-salmonellosis-usa/en/>Salmonellosis -- United States of America-----------------------------------------On 20 Apr 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of an ongoing investigation of 4 multistate outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to exposure to small turtles (with shell length less than 4 inches/10 centimetres) or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat) in the USA.A total of 124 cases with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 22 states. Of these, 33 percent of patients have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. Of the total, 51 cases (41 percent) were aged less than 5 years. The earliest illness associated with the 4 outbreaks began on 1 Jan 2015. Initial investigations have identified 4 turtle farms in Louisiana as potential sources of the turtles linked to these 2015 outbreaks. Pond water testing from the 4 farms resulted in the identification of additional non-outbreak _Salmonella_ isolates.Public health response----------------------The CDC is investigating these outbreaks and the identified turtle farms which may have exported turtles with _Salmonella_ internationally. Results of the epidemiologic, laboratory and environmental investigations indicate exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat) as the sources of these outbreaks.WHO risk assessment-------------------Despite the sale and distribution of small turtles in the USA has been banned since 1975, _Salmonella_ outbreaks linked to pet turtles have been recorded in the USA. Turtles are a known cause of human salmonellosis in the USA, particularly in infants and young children -- in this outbreak most illnesses are infants and young children.Since the infection is linked to exposure to small turtles that have been exported internationally, there is a risk to pediatric populations in other countries. The risk of morbidity and mortality is higher in patients with severe immunosuppression. PAHO/WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.WHO advice----------Countries that import reptile or amphibian pets, including small turtles, should pay attention to potential imports of infected pets and potential outbreaks of salmonellosis in local turtle populations, and inform local health authorities to consider exposure to small turtles and other reptile or amphibian pets when investigating cases of salmonellosis, especially in the pediatric population.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The last CDC report on its outbreak reporting site is from October 2015 (<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/small-turtles-10-15/index.html>). Both _S._ Poona and _S._ Sandiego were outbreak strains.In 2008, CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC: _Salmonella_ Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles -- USA, 2007-2008. Morbid Mortal Weekly Rep 2008; 57(03): 69-72; <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm>. Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below:""The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86 percent to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.""Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90 percent (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might recontaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).""Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6 percent of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20 percent of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.References----------1.
