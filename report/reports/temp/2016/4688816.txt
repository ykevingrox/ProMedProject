Since then, they have flourished in south-east Queensland and are now estimated to be within 50 km (30 miles) of the New South Wales border.The aggressive insect is known to bite humans and livestock en masse. Its venomous sting can cause blistered spots or even trigger a deadly allergic reaction.In the United States, more than 80 deaths have been attributed to the species.Invasive Species Council CEO Andrew Cox said unless Australia ramped up its eradication programme, it could suffer a damage bill worth billions of dollars.""Fire ants will be a massive hit to our economy, our environment, our healthcare system, and our outdoor lifestyle if we do not act now,"" he said in a statement.""Eradication is still possible and in our nation's interest but the time to act is rapidly diminishing.""The species could become more damaging than any other feral animal, he said.State and federal authorities have faced criticism for not doing more to control the outbreak.A spokesman for federal Agricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce said AUD 328m [about USD 244m] had already been spent on eradication efforts. Further investment would be considered at the next ministers' meeting in May.""The Agricultural Ministers' Forum has agreed with the findings of independent review that eradication remains technically feasible, cost-beneficial and in the national interest,"" he said in a statement to the BBC.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Most people who have encountered the red imported fire ant (RIFA) would consider it a menace, a pain (quite literally as the sting is painful), and expensive, as control measures can be costly but worth it when it comes to your health and that of your animals.The upside is that where RIFA is, there are fewer ticks.However, the small ants pack a powerful punch and their encounter has had impact on the enjoyment of outside activities, decrease in small mammal and bird populations, and expensive efforts to get rid of them. Every rain seems to reveal new mounds.If they can be eradicated, then it may well be worth it to do it._Solenopsis_ spp of red fire ant is the most common genus with several species within the group that is so problematic. Most notorious is _Solenopsis invicta_ Buren, the red imported fire ant (RIFA).Mounds are built of soil and are seldom larger than 46 cm (18 in) in diameter. When a mound is disturbed, ants emerge aggressively to bite and sting the intruder. A white pustule usually appears the next day at the site of the sting (Cohen 1992).Since the introduction of the RIFA, it has become a major agricultural and urban pest throughout the southeastern [U.S.] states. In addition, fire ants cause both medical and environmental harm (Stimac and Alves 1994).In agriculture, the RIFA frequently invades soybean crops and heavy infestations invariably yield fewer soybeans (Lofgren and Adams 1981). In Georgia and North Carolina, it has been reported that RIFA mounds caused direct interference with combine operation resulting in 16.8 to 49.1 kg/ha of soybeans to not be harvested (Adams et al 1976, 1977). Banks et al (1990) reported that the RIFA could cause as much as USD 156.4 million dollars in losses for soybean crops. Opportunistic feeding on the young tender growth by red imported fire ant occurs throughout the year and can cause significant damage not only to soybean crops, but citrus, corn, okra, bean, cabbage, cucumber, eggplant, potato, sweet potato, peanut, sorghum, and sunflower (Stimac and Alves 1994). Monetary losses occur when RIFA interfere with the root system of the plant, mechanically disable combine operation, or feed on the young growth of plants to reduce stands (Stimac and Alves 1994).In urban settings, the RIFA may nest under patio slabs, in lawns, under edges of sidewalks, foundations, concrete driveways, and electrical boxes. After a heavy rain, the colony may move to higher ground or inside homes to take refuge from saturated soil. If nesting under patio slabs or concrete walkways, the nest cavity may cause the concrete slab to fall and cause damage to the sidewalk (Vinson and Sorenson 1986).Red imported fire ants have been reported to reduce ground-nesting populations of rodents and birds. In certain instances, the RIFA may completely eliminate ground-nesting species from a given area (Vinson and Sorenson 1986). Because there is a 10 to 20 year lapse before reductions in bird populations are observed, it has been suggested that actual effects of the RIFA on animal populations may be underestimated (Mount 1981).The human toll from RIFA stings is an important public health concern. Stings may produce a large range of reactions from localized pain and swelling to anaphylactic shock, making it hard to estimate the cost to public health.The cost associated with the control of the RIFA is significant. An estimated cost of about USD 36 per household is associated with the presence of fire ants (Diffie and Sheppard 1990). State and federal agencies have spent more than USD 250 million in total in order to control or eradicate the fire ant. Private agencies and individuals spend USD 25 to 40 million yearly for chemical pesticides for fire ant control (Stimac and Alves 1994).Fire ants frequently invade home lawns, school yards, athletic fields, golf courses, parks, and other recreational areas. Additionally, electrical equipment and utility housing, home gardens, compost piles, mulched flowerbeds, pavement cracks, and the perimeter of bodies of water must all be considered when choosing a method of control.Two approaches can be taken to effectively manage imported fire ants. Single mound treatments or area-wide broadcast applications usually manage red imported fire ant populations.Additional in formation may be found at <https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/1999/red-imported-fire-antsstill-going/>.References----------1.
