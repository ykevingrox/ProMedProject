The News Tribune [edited]<http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article115556793.html>Syphilis is surging in Pierce County. When Madeline Meisburger warns her clients at the needle exchange about syphilis, many don't know much about the disease except that it was the downfall of a legendary gangster. ""I've had a lot of people say, ""Oh that's the one that makes you crazy,"" or they'll say ""Is that what Al Capone had?,"" said Meisburger, a community outreach worker with the Point Defiance AIDS Project. ""I'll say yes, but they had very late stages of syphilis, and I always tell them this is what it looks like, this is how you get it, and this is how it's treated.""As part of Meisburger's job, she administers free HIV, hepatitis C and syphilis tests to intravenous drug users who come to the needle exchange seeking clean syringes. She's started talking to them more lately about syphilis and recently began testing for it, she said, because rates of new infections are booming.[Byline: Candice Ruud]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In the mid-1980's, the CDC reported that in many areas of the United States, rates of primary and secondary syphilis had greatly increased, and in the states of Connecticut and Pennsylvania, the increased incidence of syphilis that occurred among female prostitutes and their heterosexual male contacts was associated with illicit drug use. These findings in Connecticut and Pennsylvania were thought to reflect real changes in the epidemiology of syphilis in the U.S. in general (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001315.htm>).More recently in 2010, syphilis was similarly reported to be significantly greater in female sex workers along the U.S./Mexico border who inject drugs than those who don't (<http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp>).Sale of sex to support illicit drug use may exacerbate the spread of HIV as well syphilis, as syphilis is frequently a co-factor for HIV infection. Prostitutes tend to have large numbers of anonymous sexual partners who are difficult to locate by traditional methods of partner notification, which compounds the problem. The news report above, however, fails to say what proportion of syphilis cases in Pierce County, Washington are occurring in illicit drug users or characterize the clients of the needle exchange program who develop syphilis as to gender and whether sale of sex to support illicit drug use was a factor.Pierce County, home to Mount Rainier, the tallest mountain in the Cascade Range, is in the U.S. state of Washington. The county seat and largest city is Tacoma. With a population of 795 225 in 2010, Pierce County is the 2nd-most populous county in Washington behind King County (Seattle) and is in the Seattle metropolitan area (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_County,_Washington>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
