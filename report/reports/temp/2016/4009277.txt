Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/florida-reports-5-leprosy-cases-in-first-5-weeks-of-2016/>Florida reports 5 leprosy cases in 1st 5 weeks of 2016. After reporting 27 confirmed leprosy, or Hansen's disease, cases in 2015, significantly higher than the average of 10 cases seen most years, the start of 2016 appears to be a continuation of last year [2015] as Florida health officials report seeing 5 confirmed cases during the 1st 5 weeks of the year. From the beginning of the year through today [8 Feb 2016], confirmed cases have been reported from Martin County (Stuart), Bay County (Panama City), and 3 in Brevard County (Merritt Island (2) and Titusville (1)).The Florida Department of Health case definition for a confirmed case of leprosy is a clinically compatible illness in a person with confirmatory laboratory evidence. During the 10-year-period of 2004 to 2014, Florida reported 92 cases, averaging less than 10 per year.Newly published research in the journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases shows that the 9-banded armadillos (_Dasypus novemcinctus_), animals that naturally carry the leprosy bacterium, _Mycobacterium leprae_ and have been linked to zoonotic infections, have spread their geography to affect more areas of the southeastern United States [1]. According to the National Hansen's Disease Program, 294 new cases were reported in the US in 2010 (the most recent year for which data are available).Leprosy is a chronic bacterial disease that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves and upper airway. Feared as a highly contagious and devastating disease, it is well established that Hansen's disease (leprosy) is not highly transmissible, is very treatable, and, with early diagnosis and treatment, is not disabling. Leprosy remains the most misunderstood human infectious disease. The stigma long associated with the disease still exists in most of the world and the psychological and social effects may be more difficult to deal with than the actual physical illness.[Byline: Robert Herriman][Reference----------1.

It would be interesting to learn whether genotyping _M. leprae_ from the 5 recent Florida patients in the news report above reveals the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ (3I-2-v15) found in South Florida or the other unique strain (3I-2-v1) found in southeastern states, or whether the patients had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions and, if so, whether _M. leprae_ genotypes reflective of that particular region were found. Information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Florida can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212> and map of Florida counties can be found at <https://www.mapwise.com/maps/florida/florida-counties-map.php>. - Mod.ML]
