Local 15 News, a WPMI report [edited]<http://local15tv.com/news/local/patient-recovering-from-vibrio-vulnificus-in-local-hospital>A 71 year old man from Mobile County has been diagnosed with the bacterial organism _Vibrio vulnificus_ which was contracted in waters around Dauphin Island and is recovering in a local hospital, officials with the Mobile County Health Department (MCHD) said Fri 9 Sep 2016. Because of patient privacy rights, no additional information has been released._V. vulnificus_ occurs naturally in coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico and in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It is not caused by pollution or improper food handling, health officials said. Infections from the bacteria most often are caused by exposure of open wounds or sores to seawater and raw oyster consumption, but can also result from consumption of other undercooked or raw shellfish, health data shows. Those considered to be at highest risk of infection include people who suffer from liver or kidney disease, iron or immune disorders, diabetes, cancer or digestive problems. Older adults, long-term corticosteroid users and regular antacid users are also at higher risk, health officials said.Protection from _V. vulnificus_ is best achieved by avoiding exposure of broken skin to seawater and thoroughly cooking shellfish. Symptoms of the infection include chills, vomiting, fever, painful sores, diarrhea and blood poisoning. People who think they have been exposed to _V. vulnificus_ should seek immediate medical attention from a qualified health care provider.[byline: Taren Reed]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination); and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. Basically healthy individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12238>.]
