Ronald St John MD, MPH [ronaldstjohn@gmail.com]In his defence of WHO and its response to Ebola [Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, update, vaccine 20160218.4030271], Dr Woodall has clearly identified limitations imposed on WHO by its member states for effective global response to a major health event. As he points out, member states set the program agenda while denying any growth in the budget. In WHO's PROPOSED PROGRAMME BUDGET 2014--2015, the director-general (Dr Chan) states, ""The currently proposed budget is USD 3977 million, which aligns with (member states') requests for a realistic budget based on income and expenditure over the past 3 bienniums. In the proposed budget, assessed contributions remain at their 2012--2013 level, representing zero nominal growth, and accounting for 23 per cent of the programme budget. The remaining 77 per cent will need to be financed through voluntary contributions."" (1) Since ""voluntary contributions"" are usually earmarked for specific programs, less than a quarter of WHO funds are discretionary.While there is GOARN and its successes, and a state-of-the-art Emergency Operations Centre at HQ, 1 missing ingredient for effective response from the member states right on up through the WHO country, regional and HQ offices is an integrated management system [IMS] for major health events such as Ebola and now possibly Zika. I am aware of 2 WHO Regional Offices (PAHO and WPRO) that have begun to utilize the IMS.The emergency response to major health events often involves multiple players, often operating under their own authority, even outside the control of the affected state's institutions. In the absence of IMS, the response becomes disjointed and uncoordinated. An effective IMS provides a way to coordinate the disparate components of the response.I just noted that the EU has launched a ""European Medical Corps"" to respond to ID outbreaks. (2) If the ""Corps"" is parachuted into an event without some overlying management structure -- for example, IMS, its effectiveness will be compromised in many ways.The installation of IMS capacity in the organization and its member states is a huge undertaking because the IMS requires trained personnel, endorsement and acceptance. And significant funding, which Dr Woodall points out is in short supply. I hope WHO and its member states take the challenge seriously.References:1. <http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/A66_7-en.pdf>2. <http://leadership.ng/news/501476/eu-launches-emergency-medical-corps-wake-ebola-outbreak>--communicated by:Ronald St John, MD, MPHFormer Director GeneralCentre for Emergency Preparedness and ResponsePublic Health Agency of Canada[ProMED-mail thanks Dr St John for his response.

The last day of the enhanced measures was Thursday (18 Feb 2016). In the 16 months the enhanced measures were in place, the DHS (Department of Homeland Security) screened over 42 000 travelers from Ebola-affected countries, largely in 5 major airports (New York's JFK, Newark, Dulles, Atlanta, and Chicago). Over the 16 months the enhancements were in place there were 0 travelers who entered the USA, exhibiting EVD symptoms, who entered the USA undetected.CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) said people departing Guinea will still be subject to inspection for the disease.]Funding---- 19 Feb 2016 UK: NHS volunteers being denied GBP 4000 payment<http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/hs-volunteers-being-denied-4000-payment/>[About 200 NHS workers and academics, who risked their lives in combating the deadly Ebola virus disease in West Africa, are being denied a more than 4GBP 4000 (USD 5744) bonus paid to colleagues working for Public Health England (PHE).

Russian health minister Veronika Skvortsova announced that an Ebola vaccine developed in that country did well in Phase I and II trials, and will enter further testing in Guinea, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.According to AFP, the vaccine, dubbed GamEvac-Combi, was developed at a government vaccine research institute and showed ""encouraging"" results in early trials. Further details about the vaccine were not disclosed
