Individuals from W Africa, however, had one thing on their side: the Ebola contagion.The 2014-15 epidemic that ravaged Liberia made them eligible for a humanitarian program of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which deferred their deportation and gave them permission to work. After paying the USD 515 application fee, they could obtain Temporary Protected Status [TPS] to be documented again.Since then, Ebola in West Africa has abated. Now, West Africans are being told they must leave the U.S. by 21 May 2016, the day their work permits expire, and they become undocumented again.

It is estimated that more than 10 500 people were infected with the disease, and 4800 people died.Even those who weren't directly affected by the EVD outbreak were impacted. Social activities, such as attending church and visiting with friends, ended....with awareness [of EVD] came isolation. People stayed away from one another. They didn't visit each other, nor did they attend work or social functions. Children were especially impacted by the EVD outbreak because schools closed, sports programs stopped, and they were not allowed to see their friends. In short, the children could not just be children.With the end of the EVD outbreak, it was time to rebuild, physically and psychologically. This was especially true for the traumatized children.According to Joseph Kettor, the Samaritan's Purse active fellowship program manager: ""We use sports to train children with life skills. We train them on how to respect their parents, how to respect older ones, how to avoid bad friends. We have a lot of things that we are teaching the children.""]28 Nov 2016: PREVAIL extends Ebola research to Monrovia slum community<http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/news/2655-prevail-extends-ebola-research-to-monrovia-slum-community>[Less than a week after a tour of parts of Margibi County, the Liberia Crusaders for Peace and partner PREVAIL [Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia] last Wed [30 Nov 2016] visited the slum community of Battery Factory along the Somalia Drive discussing with residents the significance of the study.The Ebola Natural History Study is a 5-year research program for [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] survivors and their close contacts which is being conducted in Liberia by PREVAIL.Speaking at the program, the Advocacy Lead of PREVAIL, Joseph Boye Cooper, encouraged residents to reach out to survivors and their close contacts in the community that have not enrolled in the study.Cooper explained the various initiatives of PREVAIL since they came to Liberia almost 3 years ago.He said that up to the present, PREVAIL has already concluded clinical trials for the EVD preventive vaccine with about 1500 volunteers taking part in the trial at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town.According to Cooper, the ongoing Ebola Natural History Study has so far enrolled 1200 participants, a number that is still short of the 7500 participants needed for the 5-year research study.The Ebola Natural History Study named as PREVAIL III, is targeting 1500 EVD Survivors and 6000 of their closed contacts.One of the goals of this far-reaching program is meant to look at the root causes of some of the medical complications being suffered by survivors and advance possible treatment solutions to the government of Liberia, through the Ministry of Health.Cooper said the close contacts (people who took care of survivors when they were sick) were also being examined to investigate why they did not come down with the virus.Other sub studies taking place as part of the Ebola Natural History Study include birth cohort, semen collection, breast milk testing, and eye testing, among others. ...more...]30 Nov 2016: Nigeria asks US for Anti-Ebola Serum<http://gnnliberia.com/2016/11/30/nigeria-asks-us-anti-ebola-serum/>[The Nigerian government has reached out to United States health authorities for access to the new experimental drug, ZMapp, that was used to treat 2 U.S. volunteer doctors who were infected with [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] while treating patients in Liberia who the virus had infected.ZMapp is made by San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. and had only been tested on infected animals before it was given to the 2 U.S. health workers.

The mutation occurred in the Ebola virus glycoprotein and is located in the receptor binding domain of the protein. This is the 1st 'natural' mutation in the receptor domain of the virus; prior to this epidemic, this part of the virus had always been fully conserved. In a series of experiments, we show how this single mutation -- GP-A82V -- led to an increased ability of the virus to infect primate cells, but not other mammalian cells. A separate study published back-to-back also showed that this mutation decreased the ability of the virus to infect bat cells, bats being the presumed reservoir of Ebola virus. These studies provide evidence to suggest that the GP-A82V is a human adaptive mutation and a separate study in Journal of Virology adds to this picture by showing that viruses carrying the derived (GP82V) allele have a fitness benefit over the ancestral (GP82A) form....more...Citation.Diehl W, Lin A, Grubaugh N, et al.

(11 Nov 2016) Microreact: visualizing and sharing data for genomic epidemiology and phylogeography. Microbial Genomics, 2016 2. doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000093Abstract.Visualization is frequently used to aid our interpretation of complex datasets. Within microbial genomics, visualizing the relationships between multiple genomes as a tree provides a framework onto which associated data (geographical, temporal, phenotypic and epidemiological) are added to generate hypotheses and to explore the dynamics of the system under investigation. Selected static images are then used within publications to highlight the key findings to a wider audience. However, these images are a very inadequate way of exploring and interpreting the richness of the data. There is, therefore, a need for flexible, interactive software that presents the population genomic outputs and associated data in a user-friendly manner for a wide range of end users, from trained bioinformaticians to front-line epidemiologists and health workers. Here, we present Microreact, a web application for the easy visualization of datasets consisting of any combination of trees, geographical, temporal and associated metadata. Data files can be uploaded to Microreact directly via the web browser or by linking to their location (e.g. from Google Drive/Dropbox or via API), and an integrated visualization via trees, maps, timelines and tables provides interactive querying of the data. The visualization can be shared as a permanent web link among collaborators, or embedded within publications to enable readers to explore and download the data. Microreact can act as an end point for any tool or bioinformatic pipeline that ultimately generates a tree, and provides a simple, yet powerful, visualization method that will aid research and discovery and the open sharing of datasets.]30 Nov 2016.
