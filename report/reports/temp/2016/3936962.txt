Arizona Daily Sun [edited] <http://azdailysun.com/news/local/officials-confirm-hantavirus-death/article_9542f93e-6fb6-57c5-a401-6a19dfe9b1c1.html>A resident of the Navajo [indigenous] Nation who lived in the east central part of Coconino County [Arizona] has died of complications of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS]. The rare but potentially fatal disease, which has no vaccine or cure, is spread by infected rodent droppings.It is the 4th confirmed case of hantavirus reported in Coconino County since 2006, with 2 of those cases resulting in death.It is not known at this time where the recently deceased individual contracted hantavirus [infection].Studies show that wild [deer] mice throughout Arizona have been infected with [Sin Nombre] hantavirus. It is transmitted to humans when they breathe air contaminated with the virus. If fresh rodent droppings, urine or nesting materials from infected animals are stirred up, tiny droplets containing the virus get into the air. Exposure to mouse droppings in enclosed areas such as cabins, sheds and outbuildings poses the greatest potential risk for contracting hantavirus.The disease is not transmitted from human to human.The illness starts with flu-like symptoms including fever, headache and muscle aches, and progresses rapidly to a severe respiratory disease that has proven fatal in many cases.Proper clean-up methods for areas that may have rodent activity can reduce the risk of contracting the disease. Those steps include:- Open all door and windows for 30 minutes before cleaning.- Do not stir up dust by vacuuming, sweeping, or any other means.- When rodent droppings or nests are found in and around the home, spray them liberally with a household disinfectant and allow them to soak for at least 15 minutes. Any rodent droppings and rodent nests should be sprayed with a pesticide to kill fleas before disinfecting or disposing the carcasses. [Fleas may transmit the bubonic plague organism, _Yersinia pestis_, but do not transmit hantaviruses. - Mod.TY]- After disinfecting, wear rubber gloves and clean up the droppings with disposable materials such as paper towels, rags or disposable mop heads.- Seal all materials, droppings or nests in double plastic bags and dispose of them in the trash.[- Wearing a mask covering nose and mouth while cleaning is also advisable. - Mod.TY]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The hantavirus responsible for this case was not specified but undoubtedly was Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) there. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as the 4 HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] deaths in Colorado last year (2015) indicate. The public needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important during spring and summer, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts.An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.The US state of Arizona can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/207> and a map showing the location of Coconino County in Arizona at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/states/arizona/arizona-county-map.html>. - Mod.TY]
