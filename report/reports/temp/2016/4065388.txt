Independent Catholic News (ICN) [edited]<http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=29539>The number of people being diagnosed with leprosy has risen in Sri Lanka, prompting the government to promise extra funds to control its spread.In 2014, there were 2157 new cases diagnosed in the island country -- a rise from the previous year's 1990. Minister of Health Dr Rajitha Senaratne said during the past decade around 2000 new leprosy patients had been detected in the country annually.The rise [is] reflected more so in the northern province of Mannar [Mannar is a district in the Northern Province], which has a population of around just 25 000, where 17 new cases of leprosy were diagnosed in 2014 -- a steep rise from the solitary case in 2011. James Pender, programmes officer for The Leprosy Mission England and Wales said: ""The 17 cases are the ones we know about, and that's without having actively looked for them. We believe that once we start looking we will discover many more. What is worse, is that quite a number of the cases are children, which indicates that the rates of transmission are high. It is vital people are treated as quickly as possible to stop transmission.""Mannar is part of the predominantly Catholic belt that stretches from Negombo to Jaffna, which was colonised by the Portuguese, who brought the 1st Catholic missionaries. More than 33 percent of the region's population of over 200 000 are Catholic. A Tamil Tiger stronghold, the area was heavily involved in the 26-year civil war, which ended in 2009. A man who is coordinating a project to tackle leprosy in Mannar said: ""The area had high levels of healthcare at the start of the conflict, but since then it has declined. As a result leprosy has been overlooked in recent years.""The rocketing number of new cases in just 3 years has prompted The Leprosy Mission to extend to Mannar the work it does in Jaffna, where leprosy cases have also been high, and where it works with local partner Kaveri Kala Manram (KKM). Called the Community Mobilisation, the Mannar project, which started in December last year [2015], will replicate the leprosy work done in Jaffna and will include: raise awareness within communities; strengthen existing government health systems; increase detection through leprosy-screening and a network of people trained in understanding the disease; provide access to appropriate healthcare and rehabilitation; [and] start a Clean Water Project by installing water pumps and digging wells in neighbourhoods.The project will also aim to reduce stigma and exclusion associated with the disease, which results in people hiding their symptoms for fear of being ostracised. ""In Jaffna KKM has worked with community groups to increase detection and reduce stigma,"" James said. ""It has included improving standards of hygiene and access to clean water. We are hoping to do the same in Mannar.""Also known as Hansen's disease after Norwegian scientist Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen who discovered _Mycobacterium leprae_ in 1873, leprosy is not hereditary or contagious and can only be caught by close, repeated contact with nose and mouth droplets from someone with untreated leprosy. It is prevalent usually in places of extreme poverty and poor hygiene. The disease affects mainly the skin, peripheral nerves, upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. It damages the nerves on the skin's surface leaving it without sensation or pain. As no pain is felt, burns to fingers and ulcers caused by stepping on stones or glass go unnoticed and can lead to amputation, muscle paralysis, and other disabilities. Blindness is also a common consequence caused by the inability to detect grit in the eye. It is one of the oldest diseases known to mankind and people with leprosy have been stigmatized and considered to be at the extreme margins of the society. Changing those attitudes and increasing public awareness of the fact that leprosy can now be easily cured with multidrug therapy -- a combination of rifampicin, clofazimine and dapsone -- remains a challenge.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Sri Lanka is an island country in South Asia near southeast India. Mannar District is located in the northwest of Sri Lanka and is one of the 5 districts in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka; the capital of the district is the town of Mannar, and the capital of Northern Province is Jaffna (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Province,_Sri_Lanka>). Over 93 percent of the population of over 1 million people in the Northern Province in 2012 are Sri Lankan Tamil and about 75 percent are Hindu (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Province,_Sri_Lanka>). However, in Mannar District over 80 percent of the population of almost 100 000 people are Sri Lankan Tamil and about 57 percent are Christian (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannar_District>).When WHO says that leprosy has been ""eliminated"" in a region, they do not mean eliminated completely. WHO defines elimination of leprosy as a public health problem if the prevalence is less than one case per 10 000 population. The national prevalence rate in Sri Lanka dropped below 1 per 10 000 population in 1995, which meets the WHO definition for the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem (<http://www.who.int/lep/resources/Learning_from_Success1.pdf>). However, there continues to be apparently a large number of previously undetected leprosy cases in certain communities, especially in displaced Tamil refugees in areas ravaged by the civil war that ended in 2009: among 900 displaced Tamil refugees, a survey found 60 leprosy cases, of which 1/3 were children, which indicates recent ongoing transmission in that community (<https://www.fairmed.ch/en/current_issues/news/?37/Leprosy-has-returned-to-Sri-Lanka>).In 2013, WHO reported that Sri Lanka had 1990 new cases, 947 (48 percent) were multibacillary, the contagious form of leprosy, 182 (9 percent) were children, which indicates ongoing transmission in the community, and 133 (6.7 percent) had disability, which indicates long-standing leprosy that missed prior detection (<http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8936.pdf>). In 2014, the numbers were 2157 new cases, 1014 (47 percent) multibacillary, 213 (9.9 percent) children, and 147 (6.8 percent) had disability (<http://www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9036.pdf>).A discussion of leprosy can be found in my comments in the ProMED-mail leprosy post listed below. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/144>.]
