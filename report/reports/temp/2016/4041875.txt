CDC [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/muenchen-02-16/index.html>CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Muenchen infections. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC, is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.A total of 13 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Muenchen have been reported from 4 states. The number of ill people identified in each state is as follows: Kansas (5), Missouri (3), Oklahoma (3), and Pennsylvania (2). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 1 Dec 2015 to 21 Jan 2016. Ill people range in age from 18 years to 73, with a median age of 51. 92 percent of ill people are female. Among 13 ill people with available information, 5 reported being hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.Investigation of the Outbreak-----------------------------Collaborative investigative efforts of state, local, and federal public health and regulatory officials indicate that alfalfa sprouts produced by Sweetwater Farms of Inman, Kansas are a likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of the 12 ill people who were interviewed, 10 (83 percent) reported eating or possibly eating sprouts in the week before illness started. When asked about the type of sprouts eaten, 9 (90 percent) of these 10 ill people reported eating alfalfa sprouts. One ill person reported purchasing Sweetwater Farms brand alfalfa sprouts from a grocery store.State and local health and regulatory officials performed traceback investigations from 5 different restaurant locations where ill people ate sprouts. These investigations indicated that Sweetwater Farms supplied alfalfa sprouts to all 5 locations. Laboratory testing isolated _Salmonella_ from samples of irrigation water and alfalfa sprouts collected during a recent inspection at Sweetwater Farms. Further testing is ongoing to determine the type and DNA fingerprint of _Salmonella_ isolated in these samples.The information available to date indicates that alfalfa sprouts produced by Sweetwater Farms may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and are not safe to eat. On 19 Feb 2016, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued a press release warning consumers not to eat these products. We recommend that consumers do not eat and restaurants and other retailers do not sell or serve alfalfa sprouts produced by Sweetwater Farms at this time.This investigation is ongoing, and we will update the public when more information becomes available. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview those people about foods they ate before they got sick.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A variety of enteric pathogens has been linked to transmission from a variety of sprouts, as can be seen in the ""see also"" list below, including _Listeria_, enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and a variety of serotypes of salmonellosis. We await the scope of this newly reported outbreak. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
