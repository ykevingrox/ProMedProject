Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/taipei-city-child-diagnosed-with-acute-flaccid-paralysis-tests-positive-for-enterovirus-d68-41775/>Taiwan health officials reported the case of a toddler diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) who tested positive for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). The case is a 5 year old boy who resides in Taipei City and has no recent travel history. On 14 Aug 2016, he sought medical attention at a clinic after developing weakness in his left arm.When his symptom persisted, on [17 Aug 2016], he sought further medical attention at a hospital, and was hospitalized for treatment and reported to the health authority.The case was confirmed to be an AFP case by the AFP surveillance investigation expert. His specimen was tested positive for EV-D68 by the Taiwan CDC laboratory and identified as the same virus strain detected in the United States.As of now, the case's symptoms have abated, but the case is still hospitalized for observation. The investigation by health authorities revealed none of the family members residing in the same household with the case and the close contacts at school had recently visited the US or developed symptoms.This is also the 1st AFP case associated with EV-D68 since the implementation of active surveillance of AFP cases in Taiwan.EV-D68 is transmitted through the same route as other enteroviruses. Taiwan CDC reminds the public to practice good personal hygiene both at home and when outside and wash hands frequently with soap and water. In addition, it is important to lather hands with soap and scrub for at least 20 seconds in order to effectively prevent enterovirus infection. Infants and children are at an increased risk for severe enterovirus infection. When a child is diagnosed with enterovirus infection, parents and child caregivers are urged to refrain the sick child from close contact with other children to prevent further spread of the disease.--communicated by:PRO/MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[""An outbreak of acute flaccid paralysis among children in the United States during summer 2014 was tentatively associated with enterovirus D68 infection.

The Western Pacific Region was certified polio free on 29 Oct 2000. Since certification in 2000, the Region has experienced 3 wild poliovirus importations. Due to the efforts of public health workers, the transmission of wild poliovirus following the importation was rapidly stopped.The polio endgame-----------------An unprecedented intensity of polio eradication activities between 2010 and 2012 resulted in significant progress towards the global eradication of poliomyelitis. Acknowledging the progress, in May 2012, the World Health Assembly declared the completion of polio eradication a programmatic emergency for global public health and requested the WHO director-general to rapidly finalize a comprehensive eradication and endgame strategy. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) developed the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018, a comprehensive, long-term strategy for the eradication and containment of all polioviruses (wild and vaccine-related). At the 66th session of the World Health Assembly, member states reviewed and endorsed the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 <http://www.wpro.who.int/topics/poliomyelitis/en/>.For the map of Taiwan, see: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>. - Mod.ST][ProMED-mail thanks ST for submitting this report on enterovirus D68 in Taiwan. - Mod.LK]******[2] Canada (Alberta): acute flaccid paralysis - enterovirus D68From: Raymond Tellier <Raymond.Tellier@albertahealthservices.ca> [edited][Additional contributing authors in alphabetical order by organization and last name: B Berenger, K Fonseca, S Forgie, K Gill, J Oda,K Pabbaraju, E Spinelli, G Tipples, S Wong, J Yager]Human Enterovirus 68 -- Canada (Alberta)----------------------------------------Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was responsible for outbreaks of respiratory infections of varying severity across the USA and Canada in the summer and fall of 2014. This virus was also reported in some patients with acute flaccid paralysis (Greninger et al, 2015). Canadian data showed that 2.4 per cent of the respiratory samples tested for the period from October to December 2014 from the 3 Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec were positive for EV-D68 (Skowronski et al, 2015). In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health laboratories detected EV-D68 in 1153 cases of respiratory illness from 49 states and the District of Columbia from August 2014 to 15 Jan 2015 (<http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html>). However, this virus has only been intermittently detected since then in the USA, and was recently reported from British Columbia, Canada in late August 2016.We report here the detection of EV-D68 in a hospitalized child with acute flaccid paralysis.Case report-----------An otherwise healthy, fully immunized 2 year old presented with vomiting and right-sided facial paralysis in Alberta, Canada. This child had no recent history of travel, but did have upper respiratory symptoms approximately 3 weeks earlier, which had resolved and then a 2-day episode of non-bloody diarrhea approximately 10 days earlier. The child recovered, but then developed coryza and was warm to touch (no fevers documented) one day prior to presentation. On the day of presentation, the parents noted in the morning, that the right side of the child's face, including the forehead, appeared to droop and they felt there was some right arm weakness, but the symptoms resolved. However, the facial symptoms then reappeared and the parents commented that the child appeared tremulous and weak. Medical assessment showed that the child was awake and alert, with a normal exam other than a right-sided facial palsy. There was no right arm weakness. Computed tomography (CT scan) revealed no parenchymal brain abnormalities, but there was evidence of chronic sinusitis and a small mastoid effusion. A diagnosis of Bell's palsy secondary to sinusitis was made. Symptoms progressed over the next 24 hours with recurrence of proximal right arm weakness with eventual flaccid paralysis of the right arm, left arm weakness, bilateral ptosis and progressive bulbar weakness.Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 14.1 x 109/l, Hb 112 g/l, plt 491 x 109/l and C-reactive protein of 0.4 mg/L (Reference normal ranges, wbc 6 to 16x109/L, Hb 106 to 145 g/L, plts 150 to 400 x 109/L, C-reactive protein 0.0 to 8.0 mg/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a red blood cell count of 126 cells/  L, white blood cell count of 166 cells/  L ( 60 per cent neutrophils, 16 per cent lymphs, 24 per cent mono/macrophages), protein 0.7 g/L(reference range 0.15-0.45 g/L), and glucose 4.3 mmol/L (reference range 2.2-4.4 mmol/L); Gram stain revealed no organisms and bacterial culture was negative; viral RT-PCR for enteroviruses (EVs), parechoviruses, herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus, were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the intramedullary T2 signal was increased within the cervical spinal cord, involving both the dorsal and ventral aspects of the cord. The enhancement extended from the craniocervical junction to T1. No abnormalities of the brain were noted. The diagnosis of acute myelitis and aseptic meningitis was made.A nasopharyngeal swab collected at admission was positive for EV/RV using the xTAG Respiratory viral panel assay (RVP, Luminex, Austin, TX) which detects both EVs and RVs, but does not distinguish between them. An in-house real-time RT-PCR assay that specifically targets the 5' non-coding region (NCR) of EVs without cross detecting RVs confirmed it as an EV (Pabbaraju et al, 2015). Typing was performed by amplification and sequencing of the 5'NCR (293 bp), VP4 (207 bp) and VP2 (250 bp) regions using published primers (Pabbaraju et al, 2013; Coiras et al, 2004). Comparison of the VP2 sequence to the GenBank database together with phylogenetic trees constructed using the VP2 region from prototype strains, showed that this isolate is most closely related to contemporary isolates recently reported from the USA (KX675261, KX675262 and KX675263 from Florida, New York and Texas respectively). It is also related to previously reported isolates from Alberta (KP114662, KP114663 and KP114664) (Pabbaraju et al, 2016) which belong to clade B based on analysis of the VP1 gene. EV-D68 isolates associated with acute flaccid paralysis have recently been shown to cluster within the clade B1, a subset of clade B (Greninger, 2015); further sequence analysis of the current strain will need to be performed to identify the Clade B1 specific mutations.This case report illustrates the need for comprehensive testing and surveillance for this agent, notably when cases of flaccid paralysis are identified in young children.References:Greninger AL, Naccache SN, Messacar K, et al.

They can cause many types of illnesses that can range from mild to severe. These include mild cold-like illnesses (runny nose, cough and sneezing), fever and rash illnesses, severe respiratory illnesses (difficulty breathing), and severe neurological illnesses (encephalitis or meningitis) [and occasionally acute flaccid paralysis as reported above]. Most people who get infected by enteroviruses will not get sick. Infants, children and teenagers are more likely to get infections because they have not developed as much immunity to these viruses as adults.EV-D68 is related to the common cold virus and can spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing, close contact with an infected person, or by touching contaminated surfaces.Enteroviruses such as EV-D68 are commonest in the summer and fall months. Recently in Canada and the United States, there have been several cases of severe respiratory illness in hospitalized children due to EV-D68 infection.Excerpted from <http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthfeatures/enterovirusd68.html>Another case report of a child infected with enterovirus D68 can be found in MD Sherwood, S Gantt, M Connolly, S Dobson, Acute flaccid paralysis in a child infected with enterovirus D68: A case report, BC Medical Journal 2014; 56(10), bcmj.org:Abstract. Enterovirus D68 is increasingly being reported as a cause of severe respiratory illness across North America, with several children in Canada testing positive for this virus and experiencing concurrent polio-like symptoms. In one recent case in British Columbia, a 9 year old patient presented with acute flaccid paralysis of his left arm following a respiratory illness and fever. Enterovirus D68 was eventually isolated in a nasopharyngeal specimen and the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. To date the patient has experienced only slight improvement in his left arm function. This case illustrates the importance of appropriate screening for polio and nonpolio enteroviruses. Clinicians faced with a case of acute flaccid paralysis should contact their regional health authority or the BC Centre for Disease Control for early guidance on how to collect specimens for testing. While there is no established treatment protocol for enterovirus D68 infection, we do know that hand washing and avoiding close contact with ill people can prevent transmission.For a map of Canada (Alberta), see <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/263>. - Mod.LK]
