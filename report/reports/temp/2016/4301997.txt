The rising incidence of dengue fever in [the Asean countries] has prompted health experts to call for a collective regional action to fight the fastest-growing mosquito-borne disease. Given the scale of migration within the 10-nation bloc [Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Viet Nam, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia], the best efforts to curb the spread of the virus in one country can be undone by slow notice of outbreaks across the border, they said on the sidelines of a conference in Bangkok to mark the annual Asean Dengue Day [on 15 Jun 2016]. One of the hardest-hit countries last year [2015] was the Philippines, which saw a 64.8 per cent spike in suspected cases -- to 200 415 -- and 598 deaths. It has recorded 49 904 cases up to [4 Jun 2016]. In April [2016], it became the 1st Asean country to start mass vaccinations against dengue. Thailand, which had earlier warned of an outbreak exceeding 166 000 cases this year [2016], recorded 18 337 cases and 16 deaths from 1 Jan to 7 Jun 2016. Malaysia has recorded 46 856 cases up to 14 May 2016, an increase of 8.6 per cent compared to the same period last year [2015]. The fever has caused 109 deaths in that period. In Singapore, where 8575 cases have been reported, 5 people have died. The region's health authorities had earlier warned that the hot weather brought on by the El NiÌ±o phenomenon may worsen dengue outbreaks by accelerating the breeding of _Aedes_ mosquitoes. To help spread awareness, the Asian Dengue Vaccination Advocacy has launched an online quiz and barometer on its website (<http://denguemissionbuzz.org/>)<http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/asean-urged-to-fight-dengue-together>[A map of the ASEAN region can be seen at <http://aseanup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ASEAN-map.jpg>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[See Also:Dengue/DHF update (18): Asia 20160615.4285786Dengue/DHF update (16): Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160602.4259981Dengue/DHF update (15): Asia, Pacific 20160519.4232403Dengue/DHF update (14): Asia 20160509.4209864Dengue/DHF update (13): Australia (QL) sylvatic, 2015 20160507.4207603Dengue/DHF update (12): Asia, Pacific 20160426.4185103Dengue/DHF update (11): Asia, Pacific 20160417.4164856Dengue/DHF update (10): Asia 20160410.4150514Dengue/DHF update (09): Asia, Pacific 20160403.4134321Dengue/DHF update (08): Americas, Pacific 20160326.4120839Dengue/DHF update (07): Americas, Asia 20160320.4106717Dengue/DHF update (06): Americas, Asia, Indian Ocean, Africa 20160303.4065700Dengue/DHF update (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160225.4049661Dengue/DHF update (04): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Middle East 20160217.4028506Dengue/DHF update (03): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160207.4001446Dengue/DHF update (02): Americas, Asia, Middle East, Africa, Pacific 201601Dengue/DHF update (01): Americas, Asia, Middle East, Africa 20160108.3921315 27.39709622015----Dengue/DHF update (35): Americas, Asia, Africa 20151124.38168182013----Dengue/DHF update (84): Americas 20131016.20056562008----Dengue/DHF update 2008 (17) 20080429.1477].................................................sb/uba/mj/lm"
