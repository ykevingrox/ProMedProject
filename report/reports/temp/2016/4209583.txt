This seems to imply perhaps vomiting, but it may mean a more serious condition.The suddenness and serious nature of this illness seems to imply a poisoning instead of a foodborne illness, such as salmonella in the milk. But hopefully, the investigation will continue and we will learn more about the causative agent of this sickness. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/941>.]
