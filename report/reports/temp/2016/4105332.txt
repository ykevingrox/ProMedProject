According to him, the 10 new cases were recorded in a single family at Jaye village in Tafawa Balewa local government area of the state, Vanguard Gamawa revealed that the fresh Lassa fever outbreak started after a 78-year-old man died of the disease without seeking professional medical treatment.Gamawa said: ""Investigations revealed that the deceased contracted the virus from Liman Katagum, where some cases of Lassa Fever were found in November last year [2015]. ""The victim was put on traditional treatment from patent medicine stores for a number of days before he died. 10 persons contacted the virus and samples of their blood were taken to Irrua laboratory in Edo State, where they were confirmed positive. ""They are now on admission at the state isolation centre of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching hospital, Bauchi.""Following the fresh outbreak, Governor Mohammed Abubakar of Bauchi state has approved the construction of infectious diseases centre in Bayara Hospital in Bauchi, where cases of infectious diseases will be treated, while federal government will assist with equipping the hospital with facilities.Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) statistics showed that reported cases of the Lassa fever disease, confirmed and suspected have risen above 180 with a total of 101 deaths since August 2015. Deaths from the virus were recorded in the nation's political capital, Abuja, Lagos, and 14 other states, according to the NCDC. The Lassa fever outbreak was announced in January [2016], months after the 1st case occurred in August 2015, with subsequent deaths reported in 10 states, including Abuja.[Byline: Nomso Obiajuru]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Lassa fever reports are coming in from new locations, such as these new cases in Bauchi state, this year (2016). Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. This may account for the 10 familial cases mentioned above. Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3741>. - Mod.TY]
