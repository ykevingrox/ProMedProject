The Orange County Register [edited]<http://www.ocregister.com/articles/children-730323-agency-infection.html>Pediatric dental infections contracted at an Anaheim [California] clinic increased to 22 on [Tue 27 Sep 2016], as Children's Dental Group said most of the 500 children who underwent root canals there have been examined for signs of illness.A pulpotomy, sometimes called a baby tooth root canal, treats a cavity that has spread too deeply into a molar to be treated with a traditional filling. It is done to preserve a baby tooth, which is needed to save space for the permanent tooth to come in. Saving the baby tooth also helps a child to eat and speak. The procedure removes decay and infected pulp, fills the inside of the tooth with protective material and then covers the tooth in a stainless-steel crown. Local pediatric dentists have described the procedure as common and normally very safe. However, unlike during the filling of a cavity, soft tissue is exposed when the chamber of the tooth is exposed, increasing the risk of infection.Outbreak timeline-----------------6 Sep 2016: Children's Dental Group in Anaheim voluntarily stoppped performing baby tooth root canals following reports of dental infections after the procedure.12 Sep 2016: Health Care Agency alerts physicians that 8 children treated at the clinic have developed infections, with 7 hospitalized.15 Sep 2016: Health Care Agency orders the clinic to stop using water for dental procedures and to replace its water system. 2 more children are hospitalized for a total of 10 cases.20 Sep 2016: Number of reported cases grows to 14 children.
