Syracuse.com [edited]<http://www.syracuse.com/health/index.ssf/2016/03/three_children_at_syracuse_daycare_center_infected_with_salmonella.html>Two children at the Rothschild Early Childhood Center in Syracuse, NY have been diagnosed with salmonellosis, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea. Alicia Gross, the center's director, said the Onondaga County Health Department does not believe food served at the center was the source of the infection. She said it may have been spread person to person. The health department is still investigating, and said it is monitoring the situation on a daily basis to make sure the infection has not spread further.Salmonella is spread by eating or drinking infected food or water. It also may be spread by direct contact with an infected person or animal. People with salmonella have the bacteria in their feces. That's why it may be spread person-to-person in daycare centers where there are infected children in diapers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While anyone can get salmonella, infants and young children are more likely to get it.The infected children are infants. A 3rd suspected case involving one of the infant's siblings has not been confirmed yet, Gross said. After the 1st first child was diagnosed, any children with diarrhea were excluded from the center and not allowed to return until they tested negative for salmonella, Gross added.The center serves 150 preschool children from ages 6 weeks to kindergarteners. It also provides before and after school care for children in kindergarten through age 12. The center is taking all the steps recommended by the county health department to minimize the spread of germs, Gross said. The center notified parents whose children were in close proximity to the infected children, she added.[byline: James T Mulder]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Non-food/water transmission of salmonellosis is underappreciated but despite the need for a relatively higher inoculum to achieve infection than occurs with, for example, _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 or _Shigella_ spp., does occur and the daycare setting is a good example of this, where there is a cohort of children who are not yet toilet trained, who are relatively achlorhydric, and consume considerable quantities of milk or formula with acid-buffering capacities. A 2010 report highlights this risk for salmonellosis: Younus M, Wilkins MJ, Davies HD, et al. Case-control study of disease determinants for non-typhoidal Salmonella infections among Michigan children. BMC Res Notes. 2010 Apr 16; 3:105; available at: <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862038/>""Abstract---------""Background: Infections with salmonella serotypes continue to be a significant global public health problem. In addition to contaminated foods, several other sources contribute to infections with salmonella serotypes. We have assessed the role of socioeconomic factors, exposure to food, and environmental sources in the etiology of non-typhoidal salmonella infections in Michigan children.""Findings: A case-control study among Michigan children aged 10 years or younger, was conducted. A total of 123 cases of children with laboratory-confirmed salmonella infections and 139 control children, who had not experienced symptoms of gastrointestinal illness during the month prior to the interviews, were enrolled. The cases and controls were matched on age-category (younger than 1 year, from 2 to less than 6 years, and 6 to 10 years). Data on socioeconomic status, food intake, and environmental exposures, were collected on the queried case and control subjects. After adjusting for race and household-income the final regression multivariable model revealed that salmonella infections were significantly associated with attendance of a daycare center (adjusted matched odds ratio [MOR] = 5.00, 95 per cent CI [confidence interval]: 1.51-16.58), contact with cats (MOR = 2.53, 95 per cent CI: 1.14-5.88), and contact with reptiles (MOR = 7.90, 95 per cent CI: 1.52-41.01), during the 3 days prior to the onset of child's illness.""Conclusions: Study results suggest that exposure to environmental sources may play an important role in sporadic infections with salmonella serotypes in children. Additional efforts are needed to educate parents and caretakers about the risk of salmonella transmission to children from these sources.- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1060>.]
