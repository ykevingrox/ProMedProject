Any information on whether the patients were exposed to the heater-cooler units while undergoing cardiac surgery would be greatly appreciated.Patients were exposed prior to and after surgery with likely incidental exposure during surgery.2. Also, did the affected patients have just pulmonary infections or did they have extrapulmonary _Legionella_ infections; were the environmental isolates _L. pneumophila_, as were reportedly the clinical isolates; and was genotyping done to help delineate transmission pathways?The affected patients had _Legionella_ infections.I have no information on whether genotype get was done and any results.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member[ProMED thanks the Epicore members for their prompt reply to an RFI for more information on this outbreak.ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding the location of the _Legionella_ infection in the 4 patients (pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary), the species of _Legionella_ isolated from the patients and the environment, and the results of genotyping the _Legionella_ isolates, if done. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>.][See Also:Legionellosis - USA (11): (WA) nosocomial, fatal, susp. heater-cooler units, RFI 20160921.4506105Legionellosis - USA (09): (WA) nosocomial, fatal 20160918.4496934Legionellosis - USA (08): (WA) fatal, nosocomial 20160916.44928232015----Non-TB mycobacteria - USA: (PA) nosocomial, susp heater cooler machine, 2011-15 20151028.3748624Mycobacterium chimaera - Europe: post-open heart surgery infections 20150513.3358596].................................................mpp/ml/ao/mpp"
