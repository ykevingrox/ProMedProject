Uutiset [edited]<http://yle.fi/uutiset/professor_lyme_disease_cases_likely_underreported/8769258>According to the National Institute for Health and Welfare THL, there were a bit less than 2000 cases of Lyme disease reported in Finland in 2015, but an infectious disease specialist says the actual number of cases could be as high as 8000.Lyme disease, which is also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease spread by bacteria-carrying ticks. When a person is infected, a circular rash develops around the bite area of the skin about a week after the bite. Milder, early symptoms can include headache and fever, but left untreated, the disease can cause partial facial paralysis, joint pain and a variety of other symptoms. There is also ongoing research that left untreated, the disease has the potential to develop into a chronic illness.Jarmo Oksi, a specialist in infectious diseases and professor at the University of Turku, says that THL's figure of some 1900 incidents of Lyme disease last year [2015] only reflects cases where diagnoses were reached through blood tests. When patients have the telltale ring-shaped skin rash that marks the onset of the illness, physicians usually just skip the blood test. ""And in most cases, that's what happens,"" Oksi says.The doctor makes a diagnosis of Lyme disease and prescribes the patient antibiotics. Additionally, when the malady is still its early stages, sometimes a blood test cannot confirm Lyme, he says. ""This means we should take THL's figures and multiply them by 4,"" Oksi estimates.Jussi Sane, an epidemiologist at THL agrees with Oksi's assessment that the agency's statistics don't reflect the real number but says the number is likely closer to between 4 and 5000 cases. ""THL only records more advanced cases of Lyme disease, when the illness has spread throughout the body,"" Sane says, adding that the agency is currently examining exactly how widespread Lyme disease actually is. Oksi says he thinks the increased incidents of Lyme disease in Finland is directly related to an increase in tick populations, which is caused by an increasingly milder climate.A colder winter this year [2016] has some people wondering whether the tick population would be diminished this summer, but Oksi says probably not. They'll be back this summer. ""This past winter won't affect them. Ticks can survive harsh winters, and this winter just hasn't been harsh enough to have had an effect,"" he says.There are 2 species of ticks in Finland, the common tick and the taiga tick, both of which can spread Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. It's thanks to research at the University of Turku that experts know there has been an increase of at least taiga tick populations in Finland. As part of a study in 2015, people from across the country sent the university some 20 000 ticks, and researchers learned that there were even more taiga ticks in Finland than they previously thought. Anecdotal evidence points to an increase in ticks in general, but there are currently no official figures on how much tick populations have changed, Oksi says.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato is a group of genetically and phenotypically distinct spirochetal bacterial species, not all of which are known to cause human disease (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/633.long>). _Borrelia_ species are differentially distributed worldwide. In Europe, most commonly _B. garinii_, and _B. afzelii_ cause Lyme borreliosis in humans; whereas, in North America, _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto causes Lyme borreliosis. (A new _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies (candidatus _B. mayonii_) has been reported to occur in patients with Lyme disease in the upper Midwestern US. See ProMED-mail post Lyme disease - USA (02): (upper Midwest region) new Borrelia species 20160222.4040006.)Different clinical manifestations are often associated with these different genospecies. Erythema migrans (EM) and Lyme arthritis are more common in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., as many as 80-90 percent of patients with Lyme disease develop the characteristic EM rash (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html>). Whereas neuroborreliosis [or Lyme affecting the nervous system], borrelial lymphocytoma [bluish-red nodular swelling], and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans occur more frequently in Europe.Genetic differences between species within the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex may result in problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, especially in regards to immunoblot assays, although it may be less important for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/169/2/313.abstract?ijkey=575b92fb19da9611b73c374a6947577b14843bee&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>). However, ELISAs using the C6 peptide are reported to overcome these problems (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/333.long>).However, laboratory testing is not indicated for the diagnosis of EM, because EM is an early manifestation of Lyme disease, which usually begins one to 2 weeks after a tick bite, often before serologic tests become positive. Clinical findings are sufficient for the diagnosis of erythema migrans (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>). Laboratory-based reporting will fail to capture EM, and when clinicians fail to report EM, Lyme disease will be underreported, the extent of which will depend on the frequency of EM in the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in that region of the world.In North America, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of the hard-bodied tick species _Ixodes scapularis_ and _Ixodes pacificus_. In Europe, the vectors are _Ixodes ricinus_ and the taiga tick (_Ixodes persulcatus_). - Mod.MLTick pics at <https://hnhu.org/wp-content/themes/hnhu/_common/images/tick-differences.jpg>. - Mod.JWA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/118>.]
