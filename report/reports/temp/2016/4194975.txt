KRON4 [edited]<http://kron4.com/2016/04/27/overdose-outbreak-on-fake-norco-pills-hits-san-francisco-bay-area/>Since late March 2016, there have been at least 7 overdose cases where people have taken Norco, which is prescription pain medication that contains acetaminophen and hydrocodone. The overdoses have happened in Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara and San Francisco counties. However, the fake Norco pills also contain fentanyl. According to the CDC fentanyl can be a dangerous chemical.From the CDC:Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid analgesic that is a full u-opioid receptor agonist (one of the 3 opioid receptors through which opioids exert their pharmacologic actions) and has 100 times the potency of morphine (2). Fentanyl is available in many formulations, and its unique physicochemical properties, particularly its high lipophilicity, allow it to quickly enter the central nervous system and are responsible for its high potency (2) and high potential for abuse. Fentanyl is not currently formulated for oral administration in pill or tablet form, however, and its presence in pill form is a marker for an illicitly produced product.In the Contra Costa County cases, there were 2 Norco overdoses in March [2016]. According to officials, both people ended up in the hospital with ""nausea, vomiting, central nervous system depression, and respiratory depression 30 minutes after ingesting what appeared to be Norco.""In addition, there have been a number of deadly overdoses in the Sacramento area due to the fentanyl laced Nocro pills.[Byline: Aaron Pero]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is another form of drug overdose from an adulterated drug. A 2nd drug is being added, likely without the user's knowledge or consent. This highlights the issue that using ""legal"" drugs can still result in death from adulteration of the product and/or from overdose of the product and that these products have a specified use, and any other use can result in death.Normally, Norco contains a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Hydrocodone is an opioid pain medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic.""Most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose, and death in the U.S. are linked to illegally made fentanyl. It is sold through illegal drug markets for its heroin-like effect. It is often mixed with heroin and/or cocaine as a combination product, with or without the user's knowledge, to increase its euphoric effects. And this appears to be the situation with Norco as well.Overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, which includes fentanyl, increased by 80 percent from 2013 to 2014. Roughly 5500 people died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids in 2014.Reports from law enforcement indicate that much of the synthetic opioid overdose increase may be due to illegally made fentanyl. According to data from the National Forensic Laboratory Information System, confiscations, or seizures, of fentanyl increased by nearly 7x from 2012 to 2014. There were 4585 fentanyl confiscations in 2014. This suggests that the sharp rise in fentanyl-related deaths may be due to increased availability of illegally made, non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, and not prescribed fentanyl.The number of states reporting 20 or more fentanyl confiscations every 6 months is increasing. From July to December 2014, 18 states reported 20 or more fentanyl drug confiscations.Naloxone is a safe and effective antidote to opioid-related overdoses, including heroin and fentanyl and is a critical tool in preventing fatal opioid overdoses. Depending on state and local laws, this medication can be administered by EMS, law enforcement, other drug users, or family and friend bystanders who have obtained the medication.Portions of this comment were extracted from: <http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/fentanyl.html> and <http://www.drugs.com/norco.html>. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
