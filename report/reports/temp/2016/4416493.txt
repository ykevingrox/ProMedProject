WFMY News 2 [edited]<http://www.wfmynews2.com/news/health/north-carolina-boy-nearly-dies-from-mosquito-bite/296419115>Dangerous mosquito borne viruses like chikungunya, Zika and [the parasite] malaria are well known, but have you heard about La Crosse encephalitis?An 11-year-old Asheville [North Carolina] boy is now recovering at Levine Children's Hospital because of La Crosse encephalitis. His mother says he could have died if it wasn't caught soon enough.[The boy's] mother says he was playing outside, was bitten by a mosquito and quickly developed severe headaches that didn't seem to go away with treatment.""They did some MRIs, they did some more tests and they did another spinal tap on him,"" said [the mother].Doctors eventually determined the boy was bitten by a mosquito infected by the La Crosse encephalitis virus. He was rushed to Charlotte and was hospitalized.Friday [12 Aug 2016] the family invited NBC Charlotte into the hospital to share his story.[The boy] suffered a stroke, which triggered speech issues and weakness. Now he's learning to keep his balance while walking down the hallway.[The boy] says, ""I'm good, I'm getting stronger and stronger.""He says he has a message for his friends back home. ""I hope all of you are doing better and hopefully no mosquitoes bite you.""As [the boy] goes through rehab in Charlotte, his mother says his life has changed forever.""He has a lot of memory loss. He was entering the 6th grade. He won't be going into 6th grade like he should be because he can't remember certain numbers and he's not remembering his ABC's completely.""Dr. Stephen Keener with the Mecklenburg County Health Department says mosquito borne viruses can be dangerous and even deadly.""Occasionally because they do attack the brain there can be serious consequences,"" Keener said.[The boy's] family is with him around the clock in Charlotte as he's on the road to recovery.His mother says she is able to remain steadfast and strong through all of this because she wants families out there to know this could happen to anyone.""I've made it my mission that once I'm done with one fight that I need to start another fight and that has helped to me,"" [the mother] said.The good news, doctors expect [the boy] to be out of the hospital and headed back home in the next few days.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There was a previous case reported in North Carolina in 2015. As noted in that and previous cases, this above North Carolina case occurred in one of the focal La Crosse virus (LACV) endemic areas. Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur and there may be neurological sequelae as in the above case. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus, without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus maintained through transovarial transmission.LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio, and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at <http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>). There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA. The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution and clinical characteristics (<http://www.cdc.gov/LAC/index.html>).An image of _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_ can be seen at: <http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=2166>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the USA showing the location of North Carolina on the east coast can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5719>. - Mod.TY]
