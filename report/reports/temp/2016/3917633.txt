The diagnosis was made following epidemiological, laboratory, and serological assessments. After a previous outbreak of urogenital schistosomiasis during the summer of 2013, when more than 120 infections were diagnosed, this further case indicates transmission was still effective in 2015, thus suggesting a permanent presence of schistosomiasis in Corsica.Conclusion----------Permanent transmission of schistosomiasis in Corsica is a new challenge for the French and European health authorities, whose goals should be to improve the effectiveness of screening and consecutive treatment of the infected, and to list any new case of autochthonous schistosomiasis. These measures will improve control of the initial focus and may prevent a possible expansion of urogenital schistosomiasis across southern Europe. General practitioners and specialists should become aware that schistosomiasis is not exclusively a tropical disease but has to be added to other possible aetiologies of blood eosinophilia or haematuria, even in patients without a history of staying in Africa or the Middle East.Physicians should also be reminded that the pre-patent period of the infection, during which serological tests are still negative, may last forÛämore than 3 months and that seroconversion, such as assessed by Western blot, could be delayed when compared with the results provided by ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] or IHA [indirect hemagglutination assay] screening tests.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is to our knowledge the 1st permanent focus documented in Europe. The complete report and references are available at the source URL above.The report demonstrates that schistosomiasis is a possibility in Southern Europe and this diagnosis should be kept in mind in cases with haematuria, unexplained abdominal pain with eosinophilia, or elevated total-IgE, even without a travel history to previously well known endemic areas. - Mod.EPA European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) rapid risk assessment, entitled Local transmission of _Schistosoma haematobium_ in Corsica, France, 1st update, dated 23 Jul 2015, can be accessed at <http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/risk-assessment-Schistosoma%20haematobium-Corsica-update_TOR1N6.pdf>. - Sr.Tech, Ed.MJ.The River Cavu can be seen on the map of Corsica at <http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/risk-assessment-Schistosoma%20haematobium-Corsica-update_TOR1N6.pdf>A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34867>.]
