But it was not until 5 months -- and many deaths -- later that WHO said Ebola was an international public health emergency.][WHO did respond quickly to the Zika outbreak in the Americas, declaring on 1 Feb 2016 that the association of Zika infection with clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

Ebola virus is responsible for the fatal Ebola virus disease (EVD).2. åÊIdentifying the distribution area of the Ebola virus is crucial for understanding the risk factors conditioning the emergence of new EVD cases. Existing distribution models have underrepresented the potential contribution that reservoir species and vulnerable species make in sustaining the presence of the virus.3. åÊIn this paper, we map favorable areas for Ebola virus in Africa according to environmental and zoogeographical descriptors, independent of human-to-human transmissions.

Findings also highlighted a strong link between the Ebola virus and tropical rainforests, contributing valuable knowledge to efforts to contain the spread of the ongoing outbreak in West Africa.The study, published in science journal Mammal Review, was carried out by a research team led by scientists John Fa and Robert Nasi from the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), together with JesÌ¼s Olivero and colleagues from the University of MÌÁlaga, including US virologist Jean Paul Gonzalez and Zoological Society of London wildlife epidemiologist Andrew Cunningham.The teams were the 1st to apply biogeographical techniques to map favorable conditions for a virus, resulting in a map of hotspots where Ebola may spread and thrive in the wild on the African continent. The map showed favorable conditions for Ebola across 17 countries stretching from Guinea in the west to Uganda in the East African Lakes region. Areas with tropical rainforest showed greater favorability than areas south of the Congo River.Several areas of favorability for the virus overlapped with areas where cases of the disease in humans have been reported, such as the Congo Basin. But other areas revealed as favorable environments have yet to report cases of Ebola, including Cameroon, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Tanzania.""This information is essential for the development of early warning systems aiming to optimize the efficacy of prevention measures,"" Olivero commented.Challenging the preconception that the Ebola virus is mainly carried by 3 species of fruit bats, the study produced an additional list of more than 60 species of animals flagged as potential carriers of the disease, including rodents, primates, ungulates (hoofed mammals), a civet and a shrew. This finding has implications for the hunting and butchering of wild animals for food, or what is known as bushmeat.Fa, a bushmeat expert, said that although hunting, butchering and eating bushmeat could be a major source of transmission of Ebola, putting a blanket ban on bushmeat hunting or consumption is not a viable measure - and neither is destroying all species suspected as carriers. ""We have to have very clear and realistic ways of trying to stop the transmission from infected animals to people without necessarily stopping people from doing what they've done, which is essentially hunting for food,"" Fa said.Fa said that working with at-risk hunters and communities will be critical for stopping the spillover of infection from animals to humans. Further research into the communities of animals identified in the study, and how their habitats are affected by human activities such as deforestation and urbanization, is also needed.

We retrospectively studied clinical signs and symptoms and risk factors for fatal outcome among 31 Ebola virus-positive patients admitted to the Ebola Treatment Center in Moyamba District, Sierra Leone. We found a higher rate of bleeding manifestations than reported elsewhere during the outbreak. Significant predictors for death were shorter time from symptom onset to admission, male sex, high viral load on initial laboratory testing, severe pain, diarrhea, bloody feces, and development of other bleeding manifestations during hospitalization. These risk factors for death could be used to identify patients in need of more intensive medical support. The lack of fever in as many as one third of EVD cases may have implications for temperature-screening practices and case definitions.]8 June 2016.

The potential for sexual transmission to compromise control of Ebola virus outbreaks. Royal Society Biology Letters 2016; 12 (6): 20151079. DOI:10.1098/rsbl.2015.1079AbstractRecent evidence suggests that sexual contact may give rise to transmission of Ebola virus long after infection has been cleared from blood. We develop a simple mathematical model that incorporates contact transmission and sexual transmission parametrized from data relating to the 2013-2015 West African Ebola epidemic. The model explores scenarios where contact transmission is reduced following infection events, capturing behavior change, and quantifies how these actions reducing transmission may be compromised by sexual transmission in terms of increasing likelihood, size and duration of outbreaks. We characterize the extent to which sexual transmission operates in terms of the probability of initial infection resolving to sexual infectiousness and the sexual transmission rate, and relate these parameters to the overall case burden. We find that sexual transmission can have large effects on epidemic dynamics (increasing attack ratios from 25 per cent in scenarios without sexual transmission but with contact-transmission-reducing behaviour, up to 80 per cent in equivalent scenarios with sexual transmission)].8 Jun 2016: Ebola virus can survive months in syringe needles, one week on paper money<https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/local-regional-communities-and-organizations/cidrap/754846-cidrap-ebola-survival-in-needles-mrsa-in-new-york-city>[""Ebola virus (EBOV) from the West Africa outbreak survived more than 30 days in blood in syringe needles -- even in hot, humid conditions -- and 6 days on paper money under experimental conditions, according to a study yesterday [7 Jun 2016] in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.""Citation.Westhoff Smith D, Hill-Batorski L, Njai.
