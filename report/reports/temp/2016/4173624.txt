He has presented with cough with sputum, headache and gouty attack since [6 Apr 2016] and consulted a private doctor on [7 Apr 2016]. He sought medical consultation from another private doctor on [14 Apr 2016] and was found to have fever. He developed confusion and refused eating on [17 Apr 2016], and was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital by ambulance for treatment on the same day. He was subsequently admitted to an isolation ward.The patient's sputum specimens tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus upon laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP. The patient will be transferred to the Hospital Authority Infectious Disease Centre in Princess Margaret Hospital for further management.He is currently in a stable condition. Initial investigations by the CHP revealed that the patient visited a wet market near his residence in Dongguan on [2 Apr 2016]. He bought a live chicken from the wet market and slaughtered it on [3 Apr 2016]. His 2 travel collaterals and another 3 close contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. Tracing of the patient's contacts in Hong Kong is ongoing. The CHP's investigation is continuing.The case will be notified to the World Health Organization and the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The CHP is communicating with the mainland health authority to follow up on the patient's exposure and movements in the mainland. Based on information available thus far, it is classified as an imported case.Letters to doctors, hospitals, kindergartens, child care centres and primary and secondary schools as well as residential care homes for the elderly and the disabled will be issued to alert them to the latest situation.This is the 16th imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection confirmed in Hong Kong. From 2013 to date, 738 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection have been reported by the Mainland health authorities.The DH's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up. The display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is under way. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.The public should remain vigilant and heed the advice against avian influenza below:- do not visit live poultry markets and farms;- avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;- if contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;- avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and- wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.The public may visit the CHP's pages below for more information:- the avian influenza page (<http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html>);- the weekly Avian Influenza Report (<http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/3879.html>);- the avian influenza-affected areas and global statistics (<http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf>);- the Facebook page (<http://www.fb.com/CentreforHealthProtection>); and- the YouTube channel (<http://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel>).--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Anhui - new case reportedDate: Tue 19 Apr 2016 Source: Avian Flu Diary [edited]<http://afludiary.blogspot.fr/2016/04/anhui-province-reports-new-h7n9-case.html>""New one case of H7N9 influenza in Ma'anshan [Anhui Province]. Patient, male, 62 years old, who [is from] Ma'anshan City, [18 Apr 2016 was] diagnosed before the onset of the history of exposure to live poultry market; in a critical condition in a hospital treatment in Ma'anshan, Ma'anshan City; has started joint prevention and control mechanism.The province reported a total of cases of H7N9 influenza as 6 cases, 4 deaths in 2016. (Emergency Committee Office)""According to the local health ministry this makes the 6th H7N9 case reported out of Anhui Province in 2016.Hong Kong's Avian Influenza report, updated today [19 Apr 2016] and based on official WHO reports, only shows 1 case from Anhui Province since October of last year [2015].For well over a year now, reporting on H7N9 cases out of China has been erratic, and often comes in the form of belated bulk releases by China's HFPC [Health and Family Planning Commission]. A few provinces still post brief announcements, like the one today, albeit sometimes inconsistently.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[According to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected mainly from live bird markets, vendors and some commercial or breeding farms. Almost all cases of A(H7N9) from Hong Kong have been importations from mainland China.Information to date does not support sustained human-to-human transmission, although limited human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded in very few clusters of cases. A total of 17 family clusters have been detected in mainland China, all through contact tracing. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
