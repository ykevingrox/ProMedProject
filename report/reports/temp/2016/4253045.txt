Limerick Leader [edited]<http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/208338/HSE-alert-over-measles-outbreak-in.html>HSE alert over measles outbreak in West Limerick and Kerry----------------------------------------------------------10 cases of measles have been reported in the West Limerick [Limerick County] and Kerry [County] area over the past 2 weeks. This compares with a total of 6 cases reported for the entire country last year [2015]. So far, only half of the 10 cases have been confirmed through laboratory tests while the results on the remaining 5 are pending.Dr Rose Fitzgerald, a specialist in public health medicine has, however, stressed that ""most people will have nothing to worry about as the vast majority of the population have either had measles infection or been fully vaccinated. We are being very cautious in this instance because measles is potentially a serious condition,"" she said, before adding: ""We are currently very close to eliminating measles here in Ireland.""So far, the HSE [Health Service Executive] has traced all known contacts of the reported cases and advised them of the risks and will continue to identify those who may have been exposed to warn people and prevent further transmission.Measles is highly infectious and is spread easily and, according to a HSE spokesman, there is a high chance that individuals who have not been fully vaccinated will develop measles if they are exposed. ""As it may not be possible to specifically identify all those who have been exposed, the HSE is seeking to highlight the signs and symptoms of measles,"" she said.Those who may be at risk of getting measles, the HSE has pointed out, include anyone who did not have measles in the past and those who have not received the MMR vaccine. To maximise protection against measles, the recommendation is for 2 doses of MMR. MMR is routinely given at age 1 year and 4-5 years, but may be given at any age.Most people born prior to 1978 have had measles infection, according to the HSE. But it has advised that people born since 1978, who have not had the MMR vaccine and who have never had measles to make arrangements with their GP to get the MMR vaccine, which is free of charge, as soon as possible.Symptoms usually appear about 10 days after exposure and these include irritability, a runny nose, conjunctivitis (red eyes), a cough and an increasing fever that comes and goes. These symptoms usually last 2-4 days and can be mistaken for a cold. A measles rash usually appears about 4 days after the early symptoms. The rash typically starts on the forehead and spreads downwards, over the face, neck and body. The rash consists of flat red or brown blotches, which can flow into each other. It lasts about 4-7 days. Symptoms may also include diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain.The advice to anyone with signs or symptoms suggestive of measles, particularly if they have not been fully vaccinated or had measles in the past, is to stay at home, not go to school or work and phone their GP.[byline: Norma Prendiville]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Ireland can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39>. - Mod.LK]******[2] New Zealand (Waiopehu College, Manawatu-Wanganui Region)Date: Thu 26 May 2016Source: New Zealand Herald [edited]<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/manawatu-guardian/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503567&objectid=11645390>Measures to contain outbreak----------------------------When measles hit Levin [Manawatu-Wanganui Region] the schools involved, parents and the PHO pulled together to ensure the disease didn't spread any further. Late on Thursday [19 May 2016] afternoon Waiopehu College was told to close the gates as a student had been diagnosed with measles. The case is believed to be related to the recent Waikato measles outbreak.By Friday [20 May 2016] morning, Levin Intermediate staff were telling parents at the gate to take their children home as the school on the west side of town was also closed. MidCentral Health Board confirmed 2 students from the college and 1 from the intermediate had contracted the disease.Waiopehu College principal Mark Robinson said there had been no panic by teachers or parents and everyone had rallied to get the students back to class as quickly as possible. Parents have been so supportive they have been dropping off cakes for staff. The key had been immediate communication via Facebook, email, phone calls and text messages as well as notices, he said. ""It's quite remarkable how out of something that can be quite catastrophic can come a real strength. People have responded really well. ... We have really worked hard to communicate with our families, preventing panic and confusion. There has been no misinformation and we have been upfront and honest. We have been full-on.""By Monday [23 May 2016], 368 of the 650 students and 19 of the 60 teaching and support staff were back at the college. Those born before 1969 or who could prove vaccination status are allowed back at the schools. Those who can't must wait out the incubation period, returning to school on Monday [30 May 2016].Meanwhile, absent students could keep up with learning through online lessons available through FaceTime, Google Docs and Skype, Mr Robinson said. ""Our teachers are keen not to lose teaching time. Just because you might not be at school you can still be engaged. Keep the learning going, we will get there. All going well on Monday [30 May 2016], it will be business as usual.""The same message was coming through from Levin Intermediate School about community support for students and teachers. Principal Martin James said the school community had been supportive. Relief teachers are helping with lessons for immunised children in class.Medical officer of health Dr Rob Weir said it was important those who weren't vaccinated remained isolated until tomorrow. ""Isolation means staying at home during this time period."" It was about minimising the risk to others as measles was highly infectious with about 10 per cent of people with measles admitted to hospital, Dr Weir said. ""Adherence to these steps is important. Being fully up to date with the MMR vaccine is the best method of prevention.""[byline: Natasha Laidlaw, Cherie Taylor]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at <http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24114>.

The health department said those individuals should monitor themselves for symptoms until 8 Jun [2016] -- primarily those who have not been vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.The health department did not identify the patient stricken with the highly contagious virus, but said they were not vaccinated. The patient is working closely and cooperatively with both local and state health officials in the investigation, however. Officials said 18 May [2016] was the only day of exposure. That's a positive, because the health department said the opportunity for intervention has passed and any preventative vaccine or medicine would not prevent measles from developing in unvaccinated individuals who were exposed.Measles is a highly contagious virus and spreads through the air through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms of measles generally appear about 7-14 days after a person is infected, but can occur up to 21 days after exposure, typically beginning with high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two or 3 days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth, and 3-5 days after symptoms begin, a rash breaks out. It usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. When the rash appears, a person's fever may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit. After a few days, the fever subsides and the rash fades.This case is the 1st case of measles in Allen County since 2009, when 2 cases were discovered, according to health records. It's the 1st case in the state of Indiana since 2014.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map indicating the location of Indiana in the USA can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/217>. - Mod.LK]******[4] Arizona (Pinal County)Date: Sat 28 May 2016Source: AZ Family, KPHO/KTVK [edited]<http://www.azfamily.com/story/32090056/health-alert-state-lab-confirms-8-additional-measles-cases-in-pinal-county>Measles: Arizona's Pinal County confirms 8 more cases, bringing total to 10---------------------------------------------------------------------The Arizona Department of Health Services and Pinal County Public Health Services District have confirmed 8 additional cases of measles stemming from an outbreak at the private detention center in Eloy. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 10. The facility has taken steps to prevent further spread within the detention center.Public health has issued a community-wide health alert for Pinal County as one of the new cases visited multiple locations in and around Casa Grande from 15 May through 22 May [2016]. ""It's extremely important that people who have a rash and fever call their health care provider or emergency department ahead of time to let them know they may have measles,"" said Dr Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services. ""This will help stop the spread of measles, especially to those who are more at risk of developing complications.""The illness begins with symptoms which include fever (101 degrees Fahrenheit or higher), red, watery eyes, cough and runny nose. A rash that is red, raised, and blotchy appears after several days. The rash begins on the head at the hairline and moves down the body. ...
