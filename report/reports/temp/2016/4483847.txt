Saigon Giai Phong (SGGP) [edited]http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2016/9/120546/Many residents in the [Viet Nam] Mekong Delta have been hospitalized recently after being bitten by a poisonous reptile 'ran luc' (green snake), with the scientific name of _Trimeresurus albolabris_.The 121 Military Hospital in the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho said that it has received many people who were bitten by the venomous snake. One of them is an 83 year old in Binh Thuy District in Can Tho City, who was bitten by the snake when she opened the gate. Doctors provided intensive care to her because she has breathing problems and high blood pressure.A 52 year old in the Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh has been hospitalized because his tongue and face were bitten by a rattle snake while [he] drank rice wine in his front yard. He was rushed to the infirmary for treatment.By statistics of the hospital, around 100 people in the Mekong Delta are reported bitten by the snake [presumably ""snakes"". - Mod.SH] monthly averagely. Up to 6 or 7 people [are] hospitalized a day for this reason.The green pit viper, a species of venomous snake, has appeared in urban residential areas in the Viet Nam's central region at an alarming rate, slithering into kitchens, bedrooms, gardens, and schools.Inhabitants must be aware of the creature.[byline: Ngoc Dan, trans., Uyen Phuong]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>viaProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[The snake described in the article is formally known as _Cryptelytrops albolabris_ (ray. 1842). It is often referred to in English as the white-lipped pitviper or white-lipped tree viper. The white-lipped pit viper _Trimeresurus albolabris_ is a venomous pit viper species endemic to South East Asia.It is also known by the synonyms _Trimeresurus albolabris_ (Gray, 1842) and _Trimesurus albolabris_ (Gray, 1842) [unjustified emendation] and quite a number of other synonyms, depending in which country it is discussed.This species occurs from Myanmar, across southern China (including Hainan and Hong Kong), and southward to Java, Indonesia (Zhao and Adler 1993; David and Vogel 1996; Leviton et al 2008). It is widespread throughout this area, and occurs from sea level to 1200 m (3937 ft) above sea level in Thailand (T Chan-ard personal communication [PC], September 2011).It is native to Cambodia, China (including Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR), Indonesia (Jawa, Sumatera), Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.This venomous species is commonly persecuted by humans when encountered, and this is probably the major threat to the snake, but at present it is not sufficient to cause population declines in this common viper (B Stuart PC, September 2011). It is unlikely that this species is being impacted upon by any other significant threats across its range, as it adapts readily to modified habitats. The snake is collected, particularly in Viet Nam for use in food and traditional medicine (snake wine), and this may represent a localized threat (QT Nguyen PC, September 2011). Nevertheless, this snake is probably not subject to overexploitation (B Stuart PC, September 2011).This toxic snake produces local edema and inflammation, and extensive bruising and significant blood clotting. There are also cases documented of defibrination and thrombocytopenia among the commonest and perhaps severe findings. Variable non-specific effects may include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, collapse, or convulsions. Shock secondary to fluid shifts due to local tissue injury is likely in the severe cases. Severe envenomations have occurred and may result in death. Because death does not result from every envenomation, some do not consider the effects above as a toxic effect and in some databases it is listed as non toxic. Thrombocytopenia and fluid shifts, as well as convulsions, can be serious.Portions of this comment were extracted from<http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178433/0> and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2325197> and<http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0088>. - Mod.TGDoctors from Can Tho City's Military Hospital 121 have advised local people to protect themselves from poisonous snake bites during the rainy season in Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta localities. <http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/society/132475/doctors-alert-people-about-risk-of-snakebite.html>.A list of venomous snakes in Viet Nam can be seen at <https://www.thailandsnakes.com/southeast-asia-venomous-snakes/vietnam-snakes-venomous-dangerous/>.Photos of _Trimeresurus albolabris_ can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trimeresurus_albolabris_(adult,_male).jpg> and <http://www.macaubiodiversity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trimeresurus-albolabris_b.jpg>.Maps of Viet Nam can be seen at <http://www.onlineasiatravel.com/images/vn/vietnam-map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3719>. - Mod.TTM]
