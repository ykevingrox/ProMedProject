Africa.news.cn, Xinhua report [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-04/13/c_135275928.htm>Uganda has confirmed 7 cases of yellow fever [YF] since the disease broke out in its central region [Masaka] last week.Sarah Opendi, Minister for Primary Healthcare, on [Wed 13 Apr 2016] told Xinhua by phone that out of the samples so far taken from suspected cases, 7 tested positive. The confirmed and suspected cases have been admitted to Masaka Regional Referral Hospital for treatment. Opendi said the ministry on [Tuesday 12 Apr 2016] dispatched a team of 9 epidemiologists to the central region to help assess and contain the fever outbreak. She said in a week's time, the ministry will carry out yellow fever vaccination of ""all people at risk"" in the central region.The outbreak in Uganda comes as Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo are battling the epidemic. Yellow fever is an acute viral disease. In most cases, symptoms include fever, jaundice, and bleeding.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The previous report indicated that the 6 YF infections mentioned are apparently locally acquired, indicating ongoing transmission. The occurrence of an additional case could indicate that the transmission is still going on. It is good to see that a vaccination effort in the area of risk is moving forward. A prompt response to the outbreak is essential to prevent its spread, especially at the current time, when stocks of YF vaccine are very limited.The earlier report stated that there would be exclusion of tourists, vaccinated or not, from the Masaka area. No mention is made of whether any vector control measures are being carried out there. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Uganda can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18593>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18593>.]
