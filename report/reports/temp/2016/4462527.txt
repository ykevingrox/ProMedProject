Later, the Tripura government urged Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to send a team to investigate the cause of the 3 deaths. During that time, a total of 207 986 children between the age group of 1-15 years old were vaccinated in 3 districts -- West Tripura, Sepahijala and Khowai -- as part of national level immunization programme.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in north eastern India and cases occur there yearly during the transmission season. This report indicates that all the reported cases are JE only and does not attribute any cases to the non-specific acute encephalitis syndrome that has been reported in many previous reports from north eastern India. Although vaccination in the areas was mentioned, there is no indication if the JE cases reported above had been vaccinated, or if a vaccination campaign in the state is planned.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/320>. - Mod.TY]
