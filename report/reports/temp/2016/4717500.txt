Health expert[s] urged people to protect themselves from mosquito [bites], clean their homes and surrounding areas.As many as 30 000 patients are believed to be affected by an unknown disease, symptoms of which bore similarities to chikungunya [virus infections].[Byline: Khawar Khan]--Communicated by:Epicore Responding Member Shamsul Arfin QamsiProfessor, KIMSH CMI MALIRKarachi, Pakistan[We have been awaiting results of the tests that definitely establish that chikungunya virus infections had been occurring in the Karachi area. Results from the Pakistan National Institute of Health have now confirmed that chikungunya virus infections have occurred there. Although it may not be possible to extrapolate the 3 positive samples to the 30 000 reported cases it is reasonable to assume that many, if not most, cases in this outbreak are due to chikungunya virus.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) gives a confirmatory diagnosis for acute Chikungunya virus (CHKV) infection within the 1st week of illness. However, it is recommended that in endemic areas Dengue Virus infections must be excluded. Extreme care is required for proper sample collection, storage and transportation, which can seriously affect the quality of laboratory results. Confirmation of chikungunya positive cases requires enhanced efforts towards preventive measures to minimize disease transmission through effective vector control. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/764>.]
