Dr Benarkuu told the Ghana News Agency in an interview in Sunyani that the centers ought to be established at areas such as Kofi-Badukrom, Gonokrom, and Yaakrom, which are located along Ghana-Ivory Coast borders in the Dormaa East District of Ghana.][Active surveillance is a good approach to monitor Ebola virus activity, as well as Lassa and other medically important diseases. - Mod.LK]1 Feb 2016: Why it's wrong to compare Zika to Ebola <http://theconversation.com/why-its-wrong-to-compare-zika-to-ebola-53714>[The author of this article, Clare Wenham, a Fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science, believes the World Health Organization (WHO) comparing the Zika virus disease to the Ebola virus disease may be premature, as is WHO's declaration of a global public health emergency. Wenham believes one of the triggers for declaring Zika virus disease as a global public health emergency may be the involvement of the WHO committee at this point, when there is still a lot of uncertainty about the disease. Wenham believes WHO's reaction may tell us 2 things: the WHO is seeking to learn from its failure to control the 2014 EVD outbreak after it was heavily criticized for its slow response; and that BRIC countries, such as Brazil [BRIC countries also includes Russia, India, China and South Africa], may be playing an increasingly important role in global health -- their health priorities now have a global audience.][Certainly Brazil's hosting of the 2016 Olympics has the potential to increase pressure on WHO to be proactive in its handling of the Zika virus outbreak. - CW]3 Feb 2016: USA: CDC issues Ebola planning guidance for interfacility transport<http://news.aha.org/article/160203-cdc-issues-ebola-planning-guidance-for-interfacility-transport>[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidance to help emergency medical systems, public health departments and health care coalitions develop plans for transporting patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola between facilities. ... more][It seems a little late to be issuing this guidance, but may yet be useful for new Ebola cases and other outbreaks of highly infectious diseases. - Mod.LK]Non-government organization---------------------------January 2016: WHO's Ebola response: Progress update 2014-present<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/response/phases/en/>[The World Health Organization (WHO) summary.][Wonderful moving map of progression of Ebola cases in West Africa from January 2014 to December 2015] Research--------3 Feb 2016: Researchers Report on Ebola Virus Patterns Detected by Portable Lab Sequencing<https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing-technology/researchers-report-ebola-virus-patterns-detected-portable-lab-sequencing>[In a study appearing online in Nature, an international team shared findings from an Ebola virus sequencing study done in West Africa using its portable, real-time nanopore sequencing lab.As GenomeWeb reported last June [2015], researchers from the European Mobile Laboratory Consortium and elsewhere transported 3 Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinIon instruments, along with 4 laptop computers, a PCR thermocycler, a heat block, reagents, and consumables, to West Africa last April [2015]. ...Rather than directly sequencing the Ebola virus' single-stranded RNA, which is often contaminated with human transcripts that can swamp out viral sequences, the group used targeted RT-PCR to isolate and amplify genetic material from the virus.The researchers initially came up with a set of 38 primer pairs to produce amplicons prior to sequencing, though they whittled this down to 11 long amplicons after a few days in the field. In samples where they ran into amplification problems that produced missing genome regions, the protocol was modified to focus on 19 shorter amplicons per sample.][Citation: Quick J, Loman NJ, Duraffour S, et al. Real-time, portable genome sequencing for Ebola surveillance. _Nature_. 2016 Feb 3. doi: 10.1038/nature16996. [Epub ahead of print]Abstract--------The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record, responsible for over 28 599 cases and more than 11 299 deaths. Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious agent and determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification of signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87 x 10e-3 and 1.42Ûä x Ûä10e-3 mutations per site per year. This is equivalent to 16-27 mutations in each genome, meaning that sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to guide control measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to inform interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address this problem, here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period March to October 2015. We were able to generate results less than 24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15-60 min. We show that real-time genomic surveillance is possible in resource-limited settings and can be established rapidly to monitor outbreaks.]5 Feb 2016: Differences in the comparative stability of Ebola virus Makona-C05 and Yambuku-Mayinga in blood<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148476>[Citation: Schuit M, Miller DM, Reddick-Elick,MS et al. (5 Feb 2016). Differences in the comparative stability of Ebola virus Makona-C05 and Yambuku-Mayinga in blood, PLOS ONE 11(2): e0148476. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0148476Abstract--------In support of the response to the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Western Africa, we investigated the persistence of Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/GIN/2014/Makona-C05 (EBOV/Mak-C05) on non-porous surfaces that are representative of hospitals, airplanes, and personal protective equipment. We performed persistence studies in 3 clinically-relevant human fluid matrices (blood, simulated vomit, and feces), and at environments representative of in-flight airline passenger cabins, environmentally-controlled hospital rooms, and open-air Ebola treatment centers in Western Africa. We also compared the surface stability of EBOV/Mak-C05 to that of the prototype Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-Mayinga (EBOV/Yam-May), in a subset of these conditions. We show that on inert, non-porous surfaces, EBOV decay rates are matrix- and environment-dependent. Among the clinically-relevant matrices tested, EBOV persisted longest in dried human blood, had limited viability in dried simulated vomit, and did not persist in feces. EBOV/Mak-C05 and EBOV/Yam-May decay rates in dried matrices were not significantly different. However, during the drying process in human blood, EBOV/Yam-May showed significantly greater loss in viability than EBOV/Mak-C05 under environmental conditions relevant to the outbreak region, and to a lesser extent in conditions relevant to an environmentally-controlled hospital room. This factor may contribute to increased communicability of EBOV/Mak-C05 when surfaces contaminated with dried human blood are the vector and may partially explain the magnitude of the most recent outbreak, compared to prior outbreaks. These EBOV persistence data will improve public health efforts by informing risk assessments, structure remediation decisions, and response procedures for future EVD outbreaks.]Funding-------January 2016 update from WHO (World Health Organization): West Africa Ebola outbreak: Funding<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/funding-requirements/en/>[According to WHO, by 31 Dec 2015 WHO had received over USD 450 million in direct and in-kind donations from over 60 donors.

Skvortsova told reporters, ""Our vaccines are registered, which means that they can already be utilized. ... In late fall we will start to utilize the drugs in Guinea."" She said the effectiveness of the Russian medicines had been checked very thoroughly ""at various stages of laboratory tests, on small animals, monkeys.""

It was found to be safe in Phase 1 trials conducted on 52 volunteers in the United States, according to research published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine.However, another set of Phase 1 trials on 158 participants in Europe and Africa surprised researchers when 22 percent of test subjects in Geneva experienced arthritis and joint pain more than a week after being injected with the vaccine. In response, researchers suspended the Geneva trial for a month. According to Dr. Claire-Anne Siegrist, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Geneva, and the senior author of a preliminary report on the trial, the tests resumed on [4 Jan 2016], vaccine dosages were reduced. Dr Siegrist and her colleagues concluded the single-dose vaccine should be further evaluated for safety and efficacy. It is unclear why participants in the double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in Geneva suffered such adverse side effects when trial volunteers in other locations did not. The Geneva trial involved larger doses of the vaccine than other locations. The vaccine, developed by the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory and licensed to a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics, was subsequently licensed to Merck, which has assumed responsibility for ongoing research and development.][Compiled by Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A zoonotic niche map of the countries where cases have occurred in the field or been imported is at <http://healthmap.org/ebola>.
