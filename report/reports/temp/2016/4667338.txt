Health officials said chlorination of water was the only way to prevent the brain infection._N. fowleri_ enters the brain via the nasal cavity.The health department officials said despite the deaths caused by the amoeba, the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board did not chlorinate water properly, as indicated by the analysis of water samples collected from different parts of the city.[Byline: M Waqar Bhatti]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 3rd fatal case of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) that has been reported from Karachi, Sindh in 2016. The deceased had a history of visiting a recreational water park recently and local temperatures in Karachi are currently around 32-25 deg C [89.6-77 deg F] which is quite favorable for the parasitic ameba.As apparent from the report above, water chlorination has not been carried out this year (2016). Inadequate chlorination of the water supply is often implicated in outbreaks of PAM. Therefore, adequate chlorination is a key recommended measure to prevent _N. fowleri_ infection. In 2015, a total of 14 fatal cases of PAM were reported from Sindh and the majority of the cases were reported from Karachi. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56944>.]
