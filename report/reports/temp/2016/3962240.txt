At least 12 of them are considered at high risk for infection. Last week, there were only 3 contacts reported missing.1 of the health reports noted: ""Community very uncooperative and unwilling to direct us to the missing contacts."" In addition, the reports also referenced ""great resistance"" to a program to vaccinate locals who were potentially exposed to EVD in the Northern Province, a remote area near the Guinean border where [the index case] had traveled before falling ill.The health reports also referenced reports showing [there was] suspicion toward health officials, [which was] among the aggravating factors in EVD's early spread nearly 2 years ago, and is still hindering attempts to end the epidemic. Some conceded, however, that such incredulity is understandable because of the apparent failure of local officials to follow basic health protocols with the last case.Health sources (who sought anonymity) familiar with the reports said the number of total contacts has increased to over 200 people, from the 109 quarantined last week.In addition, 1 high-risk contact (the stepfather) sought by authorities, is a sheikh believed to have fled the Northern Province by boat to Freetown, possibly with his wives, who are also missing.An issue is the decision to shut down the series of command centers and the National Emergency Response Centre (NERC). Most international workers and soldiers are gone. According to Foday Kallon, retired civil servant, ""I think the dissolution of NERC was untimely.""A Western aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said money was part of the problem. ""Government agencies are being asked to come up with a full [Ebola] response but there's very little funding for that sort of thing,"" he said.][It is disturbing that the same problems of trust and not following protocol appear to exist as during the initial stages of the outbreak. - Mod.LK]21 Jan 2016: Sierra Leone has 2nd Ebola case after epidemic believed over<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_SIERRA_LEONE_EBOLA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-01-21-13-22-48>[A close relative of the 22 year old index Ebola virus disease (EVD) case has been diagnosed with EVD.

J R Army Med Corps doi:10.1136/jramc-2015-000582.Abstract/Introduction: The mortality and morbidity of Ebola extends far wider than those contracting the disease. Surgical activity in Sierra Leone has been severely disrupted by the epidemic.Method: This is a retrospective study examining the effect of the 2014-2015 Ebola virus epidemic on surgical activity in a Sierra Leone's main teaching hospital.Results: The impact of national and local events on surgical provision is illustrated by the experience of Connaught Hospital, Freetown Sierra Leone. Surgical activity fell dramatically in August 2014, the month when the most health care workers died, and continued to fall to just 3 per cent of expected activity. 2 of 8 surgeons at Connaught Hospital died of Ebola.Discussion:  The example of Connaught Hospital serves as a graphic and poignant illustration of the difficulties faced by surgeons in low-resource settings when dealing with the acute effects of a natural disaster. In any future epidemic, high levels of preparedness, training and protection, in addition to liaison with public health teams early in an epidemic, may allow surgeons to carry out at least some of their duties without the very high levels of personal risk seen here. In a country with so few specialists, the loss of 25 per cent is disastrous and will result in long-term capacity reduction.]21 Jan 2016: Diagnosis, treatment of malaria in returning US travelers hampered during Ebola outbreak<http://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/online/%7Bb607c804-a27e-4ab0-9efd-dd32721ef807%7D/diagnosis-treatment-of-malaria-in-returning-us-travelers-hampered-during-ebola-outbreak>[Researchers wrote, ""During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC received reports of delayed laboratory testing for malaria in travelers returning to the United States because of infection control concerns related to Ebola.""

Experimental Inoculation of Egyptian Fruit Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) with Ebola virus. Viruses. 2016; 8(2):29.Abstract: Colonized Egyptian fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_), originating in South Africa, were inoculated subcutaneously with Ebola virus (EBOV). No overt signs of morbidity, mortality, or gross lesions were noted. Bats seroconverted by day 10-16 post inoculation (p.i.), with the highest mean anti-EBOV IgG level on Day 28 p.i.  EBOV RNA was detected in blood from 1 bat. In 16 other tissues tested, viral RNA distribution was limited and at very low levels. No seroconversion could be demonstrated in any of the control bats up to 28 days after in-contact exposure to subcutaneously-inoculated bats. The control bats were subsequently inoculated intraperitoneally and intramuscularly with the same dose of EBOV. No mortality, morbidity or gross pathology was observed in these bats. Kinetics of immune response was similar to that in subcutaneously-inoculated bats. Viral RNA was more widely disseminated to multiple tissues and detectable in a higher proportion of individuals, but consistently at very low levels. Irrespective of the route of inoculation, no virus was isolated from tissues which tested positive for EBOV RNA. Viral RNA was not detected in oral, nasal, ocular, vaginal, penile and rectal swabs from any of the experimental groups.]Videos  -----[A set of videos describing different aspects of the Ebola virus disease 2014 outbreak, uploaded at different times of the epidemic.
