Food Poison Journal [edited]<http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/tags/general-mills-e-coli-outbreak/#.V5eC9LiLTIU>Due to 4 new confirmed illnesses, General Mills is adding additional flour production dates to the previously announced U.S. retail flour recall that was originally announced on 31 May 2016. The illnesses reported to health officials continue to be connected with consumers reporting that they ate or handled uncooked dough or ate uncooked batter made with raw flour.The addition of new flour production dates is the result of General Mills conducting proactive flour testing and new information from health officials who are using new whole genome sequencing techniques to trace illnesses. _E. coli_ (several sub-types) has been detected in a small number of General Mills flour samples and some have been linked to new patient illnesses that fell outside of the previously recalled dates.At this time, it is unknown if we are experiencing a higher prevalence of _E. coli_ in flour than normal, if this is an issue isolated to General Mills' flour, or if this is an issue across the flour industry. The newer detection and genome sequencing tools are also possibly making a connection to flour that may have always existed at these levels.[Byline: Patti Waller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2] CDCDate: Mon 25 Jul 2016, 4:30 PM ESTSource: CDC Outbreak Reports [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2016/o121-06-16/index.html>Since the last update on 1 Jul 2016, 4 more ill people have been reported from 2 states. An infection with another serotype, Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) O26, has been added to this outbreak investigation.As of 25 Jul 2016, 46 people infected with the outbreak strains of EHEC O121 (45 people) or EHEC O26 (1 person) have been reported from 21 states. A list of states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page <http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2016/o121-06-16/map.html>.Illnesses started on dates ranging from 21 Dec 2015 to 25 Jun 2016. Ill people range in age from 1 year to 95, with a median age of 18. As many as 80 percent of the ill people are female. A total of 13 ill people have been hospitalized. One person developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.Investigation Update--------------------In July 2016, laboratory testing by General Mills and FDA isolated EHEC O26 from a sample of General Mills flour. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the EHEC O26 isolated from the flour sample was closely related genetically to isolates from an ill person. The flour tested was not included in the earlier General Mills recalls.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Flour is becoming more recognized as a source of enteric pathogens, either from flour itself as here or dough for cooking. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
