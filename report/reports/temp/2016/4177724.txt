AllAfrica, The Monitor report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201604220949.html>One person has been confirmed to be suffering from yellow fever in Rukungiri District.The district health focal person, Ms Alice Kasisi Babihuga, said on Wednesday [20 Apr 2016] the victim has been admitted to Kebisoni Health Centre IV with signs of yellow fever and after testing him, medical officials confirmed it was yellow fever.The Health ministry has confirmed the disease in the districts of Masaka, Ntungamo and Rukungiri.It has also claimed the lives of 21 people in the neigbouring DR Congo, which puts at risk people in the districts of Rukungiri, Kanungu, Kisoro, Kabale and Kasese.Yellow fever is an infection transmitted to humans through bite of a mosquito carrying the yellow fever virus. It was 1st recorded in Uganda almost 40 years ago, according to health information.Mr Babihuga said the disease can be prevented through vaccination.According to World Health Organisation, yellow fever vaccination is carried out to prevent the international spread of the disease by protecting countries from the risk of importing or spreading yellow fever virus. Vaccination is also done to protect individual travellers who may be exposed to yellow fever infection. As yellow fever is frequently fatal for those who have not been vaccinated, vaccination is recommended for all travellers.The symptoms of yellow fever range from abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, kidney failure, general body weakness, yellowing of the eyes, loss of appetite and unexplained bleeding.[Byline: Edson Kinene]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Putting together a timeline for the localities of these cases is not easy. The 13 suspected (6 later confirmed) yellow fever (YF) cases were 1st reported in the Masaka District, Central Region in mid-April 2016. These cases were among charcoal collectors in the forests of the area. The above report indicates YF cases in Ntungamo District and now, above on 20 Apr 2016 in the Rukungiri District, adjoining districts in the Western Region. There is not mention if these are sylvan (forest) or urban settings. There is no mention that these cases are directly connected to each other nor to YF cases in the DR Congo nor Angola, although the Western Region cases may be from a common focus of transmission. Initiation of a YF vaccination campaign in the areas where these cases have occurred is urgent.A map of Uganda showing the locations of the districts and regions mentioned can be accessed at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda>. - Mod.TY][The Masaka cases clearly originated in the forest on Uganda`s western border, indicating that the monkey epizootic is active all the way across the equatorial jungle from Angola (see maps at: <https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=distance+masaka+rukunguri> and <https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/sb5977cc66051eb7c/image/idad4616f27ae943e/version/1359306417/image.jpeg>) and has travelled 240 km (150 miles) northeast by road. The trade route southwest from Nairobo and Kampala goes though Masaka and splits at Kabale, in deep forest just east of Lake Edward (as can be seen on Google Earth & Google maps, going west to the DRC and south to Rwanda.  The reporting dates may just mean that they only started looking for cases down there after others were confirmed in Masaka. Surveillance of this trade route should be intensified and vaccination of people living along it should be top priority. - Mod.JWA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>.]
