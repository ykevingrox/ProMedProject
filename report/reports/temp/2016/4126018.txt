County health executive Abdi Mohammed Ibrahim said 21 cases have so far been reported in several private hospitals within the city. He said the outbreak could be linked to residents drinking contaminated water. ""Because of the high temperatures, people are taking a lot of water and maybe from untreated sources,"" he says.Speaking in Mombasa on Tue 29 Mar 2016, Ibrahim said his ministry has been in touch with the water department in the county through the Mombasa Water Services and Coast Water Company, who are now going to treat piped water sources.The county government will also chlorinate boreholes and wells within the county, he added. ""That has already started and is ongoing from last week. We were surveying across the county to ensure that our water sources are treated.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices in many developing countries, most children (up to 90 per cent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.Because of this, the cause of this outbreak could be the other food/waterborne form of viral hepatitis, hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E. Antibody assays should easily distinguish between the infections.A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia. - Mod.LLThese are presumably lab confirmed.  However, in view of the recent importation of 2 cases of yellow fever (one fatal) into Nairobi, it would be prudent to exclude YF for all cases of clinical hepatitis seen from now on. - Mod.JWMaps of Kenya can be seen at <http://softkenya.com/county/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2015/05/Counties-in-Kenya.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/30420>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
