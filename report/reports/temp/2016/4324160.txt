In 2008, 4 of 5 patients died of Lujo virus infection in a South African hospital, following transfer of an index patient from Zambia. The following year, 2 of 3 villagers in DR Congo died in an outbreak of Bas Congo virus infection. If tests for other pathogens continue to be negative, these 2 agents might be considered.--Prof Steve BergerGeographic MedicineTel Aviv Medical CenterIsrael<mberger@post.tau.ac.il>[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this information.
