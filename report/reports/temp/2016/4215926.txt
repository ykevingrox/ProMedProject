Its largest town is Murang'a its capital, called Fort Hall in colonial times (before 1963). It is inhabited mainly by and is considered the home of the Kikuyu, the largest community in Kenya. The county has a population of 942 581 (2009 census). [Wikipedia:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muranga_County>] The Wikipedia site shows the county in central Kenya.Livestock anthrax is an annual constant in what was the Central Province of Kenya. Considering its close proximity to the capital Nairobi one is surprised that they have not initiated a proactive control & surveillance program for this region. Until they do we will see repeated events such as this. So far they are lucky that no one has died. This outbreak has been confirmed by the county executive committee member for Livestock & Agriculture and we have yet to have any laboratory confirmation that _Bacillus anthracis_ was involved in the recent Kenyan claim of terrorist activities. - Mod.MHJ]
