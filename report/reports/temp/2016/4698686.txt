The Daily Mail [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4017622/Former-soldier-51-left-fighting-life-coma-needing-kidney-transplant-catching-deadly-infection-DOG-licking-him.html>A 51 year old man from Manchester spent 6 weeks in a coma as his body broke out in tennis-ball sized blisters after one of his whippet dogs licked his open wound. Doctors battled to keep him alive for 5 months in hospital after bacteria lurking in his dog's mouth seeped into an open wound. This caused him to develop [a] sepsis after his immune system went into overdrive as it tried to fight the infection. Against all odds the man pulled through, but not before his kidneys both failed -- leaving him needing life-saving dialysis every other day.The man, who has 7 whippets, said: ""I'm disabled. I can barely walk, I've lost my job and I nearly died. My life has been completely turned upside down and to think it's is from bacteria from a dog -- maybe one of my dogs -- is a mind blowing thing. The pain I went through was indescribable. To actually sweat with pain is absolutely horrendous. We are far more aware of the dogs now but I would never get rid of my dogs. I can't believe what has happened to me, but I cherish them.""The man started to experience flu-like symptoms in April 2016 and was about to settle down to sleep when he felt extreme pain in his legs. His partner took him to hospital when he started to feel a piercing and burning sensation on his skin, and dark marks appeared on his face. Medics diagnosed an infection and his condition rapidly deteriorated, until he was screaming out in pain and his skin started to 'bubble' as the infection spread. Huge blisters formed all over his body -- including his hands which saw his fingers triple in size and put in plastic bags to control the infection.Doctors had to remove necrotic skin and he lost a toe and his kidneys to the infection -- which was caused by _Capnocytophaga_ found in dogs' saliva -- entering his bloodstream.[Byline: Stephen Matthews]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_Capnocytophaga canimorsus_, a Gram-negative bacillus (rod-shaped) previously classified as CDC Group Dysgonic Fermenter-2 (DF-2), is a slow-growing bacterium that requires carbon dioxide for growth. This organism has been isolated from the saliva of healthy dogs and cats as a component of the normal flora. In most (77 percent) human cases, infection with this organism is preceded by a bite or other exposure to dogs; since 1961, 200 human isolates of _C. canimorsus_ have been sent to CDC for identification (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019514.htm>).This organism causes self-limiting cellulitis following a dog or cat bite that can progress rapidly to fulminant sepsis, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with a case-fatality rate of 25 percent. Gangrene of the extremities, as well as gangrene of skin, the tip of the nose and ears can be a consequence of sepsis, septic shock and DIC. Necrotizing fasciitis has been rarely described as a consequence of _C. canimorsus_ infection. Most fatal infections have occurred in persons with a history of asplenia [absence of normal spleen function], alcoholism, or hematologic malignancy. This organism is susceptible to many antimicrobials (e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, cefoxitin, and clindamycin). Empiric treatment has been recommended for this bacterium following an animal bite in these high-risk patient populations. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279>.]
