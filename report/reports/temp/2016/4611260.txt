""We generally conduct health camps every week in different areas of West District. In the screening test, we got sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis in few areas of the district like Amtali, Mohanpur, Abhoynagar etc. However, there is no report of malaria as of now,"" said Dr Goutam Debnath, chief medical officer of West District.He also stated that these viral diseases are transmitted by a mosquito known as _Aedes aegypti_. ""These 2 diseases are mainly prevalent in the areas under AMC. But this type of mosquito is not found in Tripura,"" Dr Debnath said. [And Japanese encephalitis virus is transmitted by culex mosquitoes, not by _Aedes aegypti_. - Mod.TY].The number of patients of Japanese encephalitis (JE) has also risen in last 3 years. A total 63 positive cases of Japanese encephalitis were recorded till August this year [2016]. Only 1 person died of the disease.As there was no cases of JE found since 2010-2012, the trend was noticed in 2013 with 14 positive cases. Again in 2014, a total 14 JE positive cases were recorded. The number of JE-affected people was found 28 in the subsequent year [2015], I which 4 people died of the disease.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in north eastern India, including Tripura state, and cases occur there yearly during the transmission season. This report indicates that all the reported cases are JE only and does not attribute any cases to the non-specific acute encephalitis syndrome that has been reported in many previous reports from north eastern India. There is no indication if the JE cases reported above had been vaccinated, or if a vaccination campaign in the state is planned. - Mod.TY][A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/320>.]
