Lake Powell Life [summarized, edited]<http://www.lakepowelllife.com/navajo-girl-dies-from-hantavirus/>A 17-year-old Cameron girl is the 1st victim of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Navajo Nation in 2016. The death was confirmed by the Navajo Department of Health and the Navajo Epidemiology Center on 19 Jan [2016].Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] is a rare but potentially fatal disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control.""The disease is not known to be passed from person to person,"" said Del Yazzie, an epidemiologist with the Navajo Epidemiology Center. ""It's only through rodent droppings and urine"" [saliva and, rarely, by rodent bite - Mod.TY].The incubation period for developing symptoms can be anywhere from 7 days to 3 weeks. Most symptoms begin with a fever, headache and muscle aches that lead to chills, dizziness and abdominal problems, such as vomiting, diarrhea or nausea.""Hantavirus [infections] can also cause respiratory disease,"" Yazzie said. ""In some cases, it can be fatal."" ""There is no known cure or vaccine for hantavirus, but steps can be taken to reduce the risk of contracting the disease,"" said Yazzie.The deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_] is most often the culprit in spreading the virus, with the El Nino weather patterns making it more likely that the rodents are infected.It is not known how the teen contracted the disease, but she lived in unsafe housing. ""The house is very dilapidated externally and internally,"" Yazzie said.The girl ... had hantavirus symptoms when she visited the Tuba City Hospital and died en route to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 5th case of HPS so far this year (2016) in Arizona and the 3rd death there from HPS. The hantavirus responsible for this and previous cases was not specified but undoubtedly was Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) there. Apparently, the situation in and around the home of this victim was reported to have provided an attractive habitat for the mice. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious.The comment by Joseph Dudley in the post of 15 Jan 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160116.3942572) provided a timely alert for the risk of increased numbers of Sin Nombre hantavirus infections in the near future, especially for people living in the Southwest USA. El Nino recently has brought significant amounts of rain and snow to many areas. This will bring about a marked increase in vegetation in the spring and summer and is likely to increase the amount of food available for deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), the rodent reservoir of Sin Nombre virus. Populations of deer mice can be expected to increase, and more infected rodents are likely to enter homes, cabins and other buildings where people can be exposed to virus-contaminated excreta from these rodents. Sin Nombre virus infections can result in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, with a case fatality rate of over 30 percent.An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.The US state of Arizona can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/207> and a map showing the location of Coconino County in Arizona at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/states/arizona/arizona-county-map.html>. - Mod.TY]
