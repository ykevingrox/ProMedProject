It died a week after biting [the victim].""It is possible that there was a failure of vaccination in the area where the victim was bitten thus, PVO has already conducted revaccination there,"" Decena said.Last year [2015], the PVO recorded 3 cases of confirmed deaths due to rabies -- one each in Calatrava town, Sipalay City, and Sagay City. The cases were fewer than the 4 recorded in 2014 -- 2 victims from Sagay City, and one each from the cities of Cadiz and San Carlos.In terms of annual target vaccination, Decena had earlier told Sun Star Bacolod that PVO is eyeing the vaccination of 70 percent of the total dog population in the province for 2016.PVO records further showed that in 2015, it had vaccinated a total of 163 040 dogs, covering 70.16 percent of the 232 395 total dog population in Negros Occidental.Impounding teams of various LGUs were able to catch 2777 stray dogs last year. Of the number, only 237 were redeemed by their owners, 2262 were terminated, and 1013 were castrated.[Byline: Erwin P.

Of that number, 494 were vaccinated because the dogs that bit them were found to be rabid.""Last year [2015], 6 people died of rabies,"" Yuliana said, adding that the high rate might have been due to the numerous dog population in Minahasa.""The stock of vaccines for patients suffering from dog bites is sufficient, as it is paid for from the provincial and state budgets. As long as patients report to a clinic or hospital, they are certain to receive treatment,"" she added.Minahasa has been ranked as the most critical area in the spread of rabies in North Sulawesi, and is likely to receive special attention from the government.Denizens of the regency have also been asked to pay attention to the health of their pets, especially dogs and cats, which are susceptible to rabies.In addition, Hendrik said that when a person is bitten by a rabies-infected animal, he or she needs to immediately wash the wounds with a moderate stream of running water, then go to the nearest health clinic or hospital.He added the dog that had bitten the person should be monitored for a few days. ""Maintain the dog's health, to prevent death. Dogs that go missing or break loose are considered to be positive for rabies and this must be anticipated,"" he said.Meanwhile, North Sulawesi Health Agency outbreak and disaster division head Arthur Tooy said the agency would continue to maintain anti-rabies vaccines to ensure the supply is sufficient when called upon.""In a number of community health centers that have rabies centers, rabies vaccines are provided free of charge,"" he said, cautioning that not all health centers in North Sulawesi had rabies centers.The rabies virus, he went on, lived in dog saliva.""Symptoms of rabies will arise between 2 weeks and 2 years from the time the saliva enters the human body through bites or contact with wounds on the human body,"" Arthur explained.Typical symptoms of rabies, he said, included fever, pain around bite wounds, fear of water and breezes and a sudden preference for darkness.[Byline: Lita Aruperes]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/560>.]******[3] India (Punjab) - human vaccine supply and demand Date: Wed 8 Jun 2016Source: The Tribune [edited]<http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/anti-rabies-vaccines-out-of-stock/248420.html>Government health institutions in the district [of Amritsar, Punjab state] are facing a shortage of anti-rabies vaccines, forcing people to buy these from the open market at a much higher price.The city is facing the problem of stray dogs for long because of which incidents of dig bites are frequent here. Sources at the Civil Hospital stated that one or 2 cases of dog bite are reported almost daily.Hospital employees stated that the shortage of vaccines is a frequent occurrence. Patients of dog bites are provided these injections free of cost at government facilities.A patient of dog bite requires 5 injections. With these costing around Rs 300 [USD 4.47] each in the market, poor patients often find it difficult to purchase them. The department had recently changed the procedure for such patients, which required them to bring photo identity cards.The department had stated that it would streamline the system because they would be able to collect data and ensure that the patient completed the course of getting 5 injections.However, repeated shortage of the vaccine instead of improving the system has resulted in hardships for the patients.A patient, Kewal Singh, complained, ""These injections, whenever available, are given during the OPD hours. Instead, these should available in the Emergency Department, so that a patient in emergency can get one in case of a dog bite.""Health Department officials stated the stock of the vaccines would be replenished shortly and a demand has already been sent to the drug store.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/316>.]******[4] South Africa (Gauteng) - jackals, human exposureDate: Tue 7 Jun 2016Source: Times Live [edited] <http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2016/06/07/Pet-lovers-urged-to-get-dogs-vaccinated-as-rabies-outbreak-is-confirmed>Two people have been exposed so far to a rabies outbreak confirmed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Gauteng's Muldersdrift and surrounding areas.""Rabies has been confirmed in the past month in 4 jackals and one unvaccinated domestic dog in MuldersdriftÛ  Kromdraai and LanseriaÛ  Gauteng province.At least 2 human exposures have been reported and both persons received appropriate preventative treatment to prevent diseaseÛ "" the NICD said on Tuesday [7 Jun 2016].""Rabies is uniformly fatal in animals and humans.

Tasioudi, Myrsini Tzani et al 1. Abstract-----------Following the late 2012 recurrence of rabies in wild foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) in central and north-western Greece, the 1st oral fox vaccination campaign co-financed by the European Union (EU) and the Greek state budget, was implemented. Initially, it involved 24 regional units of the Greek territory during the period October-December 2013. Vaccine-baits were aerially distributed by fixed-wing aircrafts. Vaccines were scattered along parallel flight paths 500 m apart in order to optimize aerial missions and achieve homogeneous distribution. A geographical information system was used to objectively evaluate bait distribution. This system identified areas of inadequate bait density that would require additional flights. A total number of 1 504 821 baits were distributed covering an area of 54 584 29 sq/km. To assess the effectiveness of oral vaccination campaign a monitoring program was introduced, which entailed examination of serum samples and canine teeth derived from red foxes collected in the field. The laboratory analysis revealed 60 percent seropositivity and detection of tetracycline biomarker in 70 percent of the foxes tested.2. Passive surveillance results before and following the 1st oral vaccination campaign--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The number of suspected animals investigated in the frame of passive surveillance in Greece the period between January 2012 and June 2015 were 1364. In detail, 237 animals were tested in 2012, 587 in 2013, 410 in 2014 and 130 from the beginning of 2015 until early June 2015. The number of red foxes tested was 140 in 2012, 314 in 2013, 169 in 2014 and 60 from the beginning of 2015 to early June 2015. Starting from 2012 and up to the end of the 1st oral vaccination campaign in Greece on Dec 2013 (pre-vaccination period), a total of 38 rabies cases in different animal species (32 red foxes, 3 dogs, 2 bovines and one cat) were detected. The affected areas included the regional units of Kilkis, Thessaloniki, Pella, Trikala, Kozani, Kastoria and Serres [map included in the full paper]. During the post-vaccination period, that is from January 2014 to June of 2015, 10 rabies cases (2 dogs and 8 red foxes) were laboratory confirmed in the regional units of Kilkis, Thessaloniki, Pella, Trikala and Larissa. The last positive case was diagnosed in a red fox in the regional unit of Pella on May 2014. Since then, all samples, received in the frame of passive surveillance system, have given negative results. A marked decrease (3.5 percent) in the positivity of the red fox samples was recorded between pre-vaccination period (7 percent) and post-vaccination period (4.5 percent).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In their concluding remarks the Greek authors state that ""the 1st ORV campaign implemented in Greece resulted in satisfactory baits uptake and immune coverage in the fox population although the number of animals tested for evaluating its effectiveness did not reach the targets.""(Differences were noted among the different regional units. For instance in Kozani area, the number of samples collected was 29 instead of the target number which was defined to 68. In Arta regional unit, the number of hunted foxes was 26 while the target was 31 samples. In 6 out of the 24 regional units involved, no sample for monitoring was collected. The background to this deficiency is described in the paper.)""The importance of wildlife monitoring and surveillance has been recognized and constitutes main tool for the epidemiological investigation of the disease. The disease outbreak prompts for effective implementation of the above control measures, with a view to limit its further diffusion, and eventually eradicate it.""According to Greece's reporting to the OIE, 47 ""outbreaks"" have been recorded between the start of the event, 19 Oct 2012, and the date of it being declared as resolved, 30 Jun 2014. The annual report for 2015 indicated the presence of rabies in wildlife (number not specified), limited to infected zones. Rabies was reported as absent in domestic animals.The vaccine selected for the campaign in Greece was the SAG2 vaccine, a modified live attenuated rabies virus vaccine, derived from the SAD Bern strain in a 2-step process of amino acid mutation using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. This vaccine has been shown to be non-pathogenic after experimental exposure of multiple target and non-target species, including non-human primates. However, given the fact that the vaccine contains live strain and the lack of relevant studies in humans, it becomes apparent that exposure to the vaccine requires adequate post-exposure anti-rabies prophylactic treatment. The baits were labeled with a note stating, ""do not touch"" and provided a phone number of the Hellenic CDC center. A communication campaign (posters and leaflets, TV spot, special educational material and courses for children in schools) was implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the regional veterinary services and the students' associations of the 2 Veterinary Schools. The aim was to raise public awareness with regards to rabies and present the rationale of red fox oral vaccination program, the time schedule of the vaccination strategy, the areas involved and the necessary prophylactic measures to be adopted in order to avoid potentially harmful exposures to the live attenuated vaccine distributed by air. Greece borders rabies-infected countries: Albania and Turkey. In another neighbour, the former-Yugoslavian Macedonia, ORV has been applied; the last rabies case was reported there in 2012. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/83>.]
