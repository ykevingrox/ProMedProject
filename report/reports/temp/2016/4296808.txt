EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]Channel NewsAsia on 16 Jun 2016 17:48 reported that the 6 individuals with MDR TB live in 4 separate units at Block 203 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. The 1st 3 cases are from the same household, with the 1st individual being diagnosed in February 2012. The rest of the households were later diagnosed in May 2013 and October 2015. The other 2 individuals in separate units within the same block were diagnosed in April 2014 and October 2015. The last individual was diagnosed in May this year [2016].""A genetic fingerprinting carried out this month [June 2016] revealed that the 6 individuals were infected with the same MDR TB strain. Channel NewsAsia understands that all 6 are Singaporeans and range from their early 20s to 70 years old. Five of them are males.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 16 Jun 2016Source: Singapore Ministry of Health [edited]<https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressRoom/pressRoomItemRelease/2016/precautionary-tuberculosis-screening-for-residents-of-block-203-.html>The Ministry of Health (MOH) will offer on-site tuberculosis (TB) screening to residents of Block 203 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. This is a precautionary measure following the detection of an unusual cluster of 6 multi-drug resistant TB (MDRTB) individuals across 4 unrelated units at the block. These tests are conducted free of charge. Residents can be screened at the void deck of Block 203 from 9am to 9pm, 16 to 19 Jun 2016. Those who are unable to attend TB screening during this period may be screened at any SATA CommHealth clinic until 30 Jun 2016.Former residents who had lived in the block from July 2011 who wish to be screened can go to any SATA CommHealth Clinic from now till 30 Jun 2016. After 30 Jun [2016], residents and former residents may make an appointment to be screened at the Tuberculosis Control Unit at Moulmein Road. Screening is free.Six MDRTB individuals across 4 unrelated units at Block 203 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 have been detected. Three of the individuals, including the index case, were from the same unit. The other 3 individuals lived in different units of Block 203. None of the cases involved children.Among the 6 individuals, 3 have already completed treatment, while the other 3 are currently undergoing treatment. All 6 individuals are no longer infectious and cannot transmit MDRTB. They are, therefore, not an ongoing public health risk.TB transmission typically requires close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual. It is unusual for TB to be spread by casual, brief exposure. Hence persons who are contacted and screened around an infectious TB individual typically comprise family members, flat-mates, close workplace colleagues and acquaintances from common social activities with close and regular interaction. This approach is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is practised in Singapore.The MDRTB cluster at Block 203 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 is thus highly unusual and does not fit the usual pattern of TB spread. Our investigations did not uncover any common links among the cases, other than the 3 cases from the same unit and that they live in the same block. They did not know or interact with one another or congregate at the same common areas. While the lift is a common facility, which residents would have used, the probability that TB could be transmitted via this mode is low.A vigilant doctor from the Tuberculosis Control Unit at Tan Tock Seng Hospital had 1st observed the cluster of MDRTB cases residing at Block 203. The matter was reported to MOH in May 2016, leading to an investigation that established in June 2016 that the 6 individuals were infected with the same MDRTB strain, with the last case confirmed on 10 Jun 2016. The route of transmission for the unrelated individuals not living in the same unit has yet to be determined.The TB screening offered by MOH is a precautionary measure to assure and protect residents. The exercise can help detect any undiagnosed TB cases. Those with positive screening results will be offered appropriate advice and follow-up. Those with active TB can then be treated immediately. Individuals with latent non-infectious TB can be monitored and treated if necessary.While screening is not compulsory, MOH strongly encourages residents to be screened. The whole screening process, comprising of a blood test and chest x-ray, will take about 15 minutes. Officers from MOH will work with grassroots volunteers to go door-to-door to share details of the screening with the residents. Residents may also call the MOH hotline at 6325 9220.The risk of transmission to persons who are not close contacts of a TB case is very low. Screening is thus not necessary for individuals who had visited the block or its vicinity.TB is common in Asia. While Singapore has the 2nd lowest incidence of TB in Asia, our TB incidence is moderate [1]. Latent TB infection is not uncommon in our population, as TB had been prevalent in Singapore until the 1970s, and older Singaporeans could have been exposed to TB and acquired latent TB infection when they were younger. Early detection and prompt treatment of cases remain important in helping those infected and rendering them non-infectious. For individuals diagnosed with active TB, adherence to treatment is important.In 2015, our TB incidence rate was 36 per 100 000. 2000 new cases were notified.--Communicated by:Irene LaiMedical DirectorInternational SOS,Australia[ProMED-mail thanks the anonymous submitter and Irene Lai for their submissions. Discussions of MDR TB can be found in my moderator comments in the prior ProMED-mail posts cited below.The above submissions answer questions I had posed in the prior ProMED-mail post on this outbreak of MDR TB in Singapore (Tuberculosis, MDR - Singapore: (AMK) neighborhood outbreak, RFI 20160618.4294856). The neighborhood outbreak extended over a 4-year period and involved 6 adults, 3 of whom, including the index case, lived in the same household; the other 3 individuals lived in different units of the same residential block. All 6 individuals had isolates of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ with a matching genotype. All 6 are no longer infectious and cannot transmit MDR TB.Ang Mo Kio, abbreviated AMK, is a residential town in the North-East Region of Singapore; Ang Mo Kio is the 8th most populated planning area in the country overall (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio>). Planning Areas are the main urban planning and census divisions of Singapore; there are a total of 55 of these areas, organized into 5 regions (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore>). A map of Singapore showing the planning areas and regions can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore#/media/File:Singapore_MP2008._Urban_Planning_Areas.svg> (Ang Mo Kio is number 27). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/150>.]
