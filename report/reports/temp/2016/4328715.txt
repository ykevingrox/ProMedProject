Debate [in Spanish, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.debate.com.mx/losmochis/Brote-de-hepatitis-tipo-A-afecta-a-ninos-fortenses-20160630-0025.html>Inhabitants of the communities of Mochicahui, El Poblado, and its surroundings [Sinaloa state] are concerned and alarmed by the outbreak of hepatitis A in their villages. The viral infection causes inflammation and swelling of the liver, and is transmitted mainly by consuming water or food that has been contaminated with [infected] feces.About 20 days ago, the population heard a rumor that there were some infants who were ill from such a virus; however, was not until the corresponding studies were undertaken that it was confirmed that the children had hepatitis A. Today [30 Jun 2016], according to data provided by health authorities, there are already 14 confirmed cases: 9 in Mochicahui, 4 in El Poblado, and 1 more in the Taxtes community; however, it is expected that in the coming days, there will be more cases of people affected by the virus.Given the ease of spread of the disease, the Health Ministry has appointed a group of medical brigades to go from house to house in an effort to identify the source of the infection that is spreading the virus among the population.Jaime Alberto Villarreal Saenz, director of Municipal Health and Medical Services of the City of El Fuerte, assured the population that the problem does not come from the water as was initially suspected by the affected neighbors. ""Chlorination of the water is in optimal condition, it is drinkable, it is safe, and treated. We are committed to identify the cause (of the outbreak) first; second, to limit and try to decrease outbreaks that can happen, because we have an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks in which to identify how much the outbreak has increased,"" he saidThe municipal official said the that are many reasons for the infection, such as poor hygiene when washing fruits and vegetables before eating, or buying food from street vendors, where hygiene is poor.[Byline: Victor Acosta]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail is interested in learning more about the source and scope of this outbreak. In countries using universal immunization with the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine, HAV infection is much less likely to be seen in clusters. It should be noted that most cases of hepatitis A infection in children are either totally subclinical or anicteric so it is likely that far more cases will go unrecognized.With an incubation period ranging from 14 to 50 days and averaging 28 days, a time course of diagnosed cases would show a typical bell shaped curve peaking at around 28 days if the exposure were of short duration. The peak of the curve will be more prolonged in a drawn out exposure. In either curve, there will likely be a secondary peak occurring from spread from person-to-person (usually child to child) in the household. - Mod.LLMaps of Mexico can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/northamerica/political-map-of-Mexico.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/508>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
