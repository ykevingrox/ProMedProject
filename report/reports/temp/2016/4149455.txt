Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/yellow-fever-update-the-numbers-kenya-and-china-51470/>The Angola yellow fever outbreak continues to mount concerning cases and deaths. The latest numbers from the Ministry of Health in Angola reveals that some 1600 suspected and confirmed (516) cases have been reported nationally, including 230 deaths. This is up from 1409 and 198, suspected and confirmed cases and deaths one week ago, respectively. [32 more deaths in a week, presumably confirmed. - JW]The majority of yellow fever cases and deaths have been in Luanda Province. However, cases have been reported throughout the country.Up to date, 5.8 million people have been vaccinated in Luanda against yellow fever using vaccines from the International Coordination Group emergency stockpile. With support from WHO, about 7.35 million doses of yellow fever vaccine have been acquired by the country to respond to the outbreak. [Enough to cover the rest of Luanda, but not the 18 million people in the rest of the country. - Mod.JW]Although vaccination is the most important preventive measure against yellow fever, Director-General of WHO, Dr Margaret Chan, who recently visited Angola, said it is necessary to make the population aware about the importance of their understanding and involvement in vector control activities and in the elimination of the breading sites of the vector, the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, in their houses and their near environment. Without this involvement of the community, they may continue to be victims not only of yellow fever but potentially of all other diseases [viruses] transmitted by the same vector: dengue, chikungunya and the new Zika virus that is currently affecting the American continent. [Zika is endemic and not new in Africa. It was 1st detected in Uganda in 1947. - Mod.TY].The outbreak in Angola has affected other nations through the importation of yellow fever and cases of foreign nationals in Angola.  In China, a total of 9 laboratory-confirmed yellow fever cases imported from Angola have been reported [see WHO Emergency Preparedness report of 6 Apr 2016 (<http://who.int/csr/don/6-april-2016-yellow-fever-china/en/>)]. Kenya has reported 2 imported cases from Angola [see WHO Emergency Preparedness report of 6 Apr 2016 (<http://who.int/csr/don/6-april-2016-yellow-fever-kenya/en/>)]. [Mauritania and the DR Congo have also reported imported cases (see archives cited below). - Mod.TY]On Thursday [7 Apr 2016], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated their travel notice to Angola [see comment below].Yellow fever is a disease caused by a virus, which is spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms take 3-6 days to develop and include fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches [and jaundice -- hence the name - Mod.JW]. About 15 percent of people who get yellow fever develop serious illness that can lead to bleeding, shock, organ failure, and sometimes death.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday (7 Apr 2016) upgraded its travel alert for individuals going to Angola to level 2 out of 3 (""practice enhanced precautions""), recommending that all travelers to the country who are 9 months of age or older be vaccinated for yellow fever (YF), and Angola's ministry of health now requires that anyone of this age entering the country have proof of vaccination, according to the CDC (<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/04/news-scan-apr-08-2016>).  Those over age 60 or have other contraindications may show a doctor`s waiver.The Health Minister has announced that YF has spread to 16 of 18 Angola's provinces (<http://leadership.ng/news/516021/angolas-yellow-fever-death-toll-rises-225-says-health-minister>). The vaccination campaign has been focused on the capital, Luanda, where most of the cases have occurred. WHO has indicated that its emergency vaccine stockpile has now been completely exhausted (<http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/angolan-yellow-fever-outbreak-highlights-dangerous-vaccine-shortage>), but it has managed to find 3 million more doses. However, unless there is authorization to reduce the volume per dose to extend the number available, there is not enough vaccine to cover the remaining 18 million people in Angola. This should be done [Ref: Campi-Azevedo AC et. al. 2014 Subdoses of 17DD yellow fever vaccine elicit equivalent virological/immunological kinetics timeline.  BMC Infect Dis. 2014 Jul 15;14:391.

""The orientation is towards integrating Chinese companies on regular cleaning effort made by attacking the passive,"" [sic] he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Garbage and trash removal to promote urban sanitation is always a good idea. However, if the intention is to reduce _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquito breeding sites it will not be especially effective. These mosquitoes breed in water storage tanks and other water catchments, some very small, in and around people's homes and work places. Community education and public participation in eliminating or treating these sites with larvicides is the only approach that will help reduce the numbers of these mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]******[3] North Koreans in AngolaDate: Fri 8 Apr 2016Source: The Korean Herald [edited]<http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160408000773>Around 10 North Korean workers dispatched to Angola have died of yellow fever in the southern African country, a U.S. radio outlet said Friday [8 Apr 2016].About 450 people have been confirmed to be infected with the viral disease in Angola since the 1st case was reported in December [2015] in the country's capital, the Washington-based Radio Free Asia (RFA) report said. [Now 1600 -- see above]Among those that caught yellow fever, 178 [now 230-- see above] have died so far, with the disease spreading rapidly in nearby countries, the RFA said, quoting sources. [There have been cases imported into neighboring countries. Fortunately, there has been no ongoing transmission, so it is inaccurate to state that the disease is rapidly spreading in those countries. - Mod.TY]It said some 1000 North Korean workers are in Angola, including construction workers and medical staff, the report said, referring to the workforce North Korea dispatches overseas to earn money. The recent deaths of the North Koreans calls into question the quality of North Korea's yellow fever vaccine and the veracity of North Korea's claims to have inoculated its workers sent to the African country, according to the report. Those who became sick have asked to be repatriated, but the North Korean government has opted to not comply out of fear that they could cause the disease to spread at home, the media company said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has received about North Koreans working in Angola and coming down with yellow fever (YF). With 10 deaths, the total number of YF virus infected individuals probably exceeds 30. One wonders if any of these North Korean workers were indeed immune from vaccination upon arrival to Angola. Mosquitoes have not come out of hibernation in North Korea, so there is no possibility of spread there yet, and in any case, _A. aegypti_ does not occur there.A map of North Korea can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/north-korea/>. - Mods.TY/JW]
