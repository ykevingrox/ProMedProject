Time Warner Cable News [edited]<http://www.twcnews.com/nys/buffalo/news/2016/10/14/mighty-taco-foodborne-illness-cause-erie-niagara-counties-.html>The cause behind the foodborne illness that made more than 140 Mighty Taco customers sick could be released as early as Friday, 14 Oct 2016. Erie County [New York State] Health Department officials who work at the Rath Building say a sample from those beans was sent away a week ago as part of a state health department investigation. Friday is the earliest the organization could release the results, although they caution results could take weeks to come in.On Thursday, 13 Oct 2016, Mighty Taco named Pennsylvania company Pellegrino Food Products as the manufacturer of the bad beans. At least 142 people in Erie and Niagara counties who ate those beans between 23 Sep 2016 and 6 Oct 2016 complained of nausea and vomiting. No one has reported getting sick since Mighty Taco removed the beans.The company also took to Facebook on Thursday night to answer common questions that many customers had and ensured them this was a ""isolated and unprecedented situation that we have not encountered in our 43 year history of serving the Western New York public.""""Pellegrino Food Products Co, Inc stands behind the quality of all of its products and takes food safety issues very seriously. Refried beans are manufactured exclusively for Mighty Taco. To Pellegrino Food's knowledge, no root cause has yet been determined of the reported illnesses, and we are actively working with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture in its investigation,"" Pellegrino Foods Production Co said in a statement.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The cause of the illness is not yet elucidated nor has whether illnesses outside western New York State have occurred. It would be useful to know what the time interval was between ingestion of the beans and the onset of symptoms, whether fever was present and how long the illness lasted. A small cluster of gastroenteritis associated with refried beans in 2005 in Minnesota was caused by _Clostridium perfringens_ (<http://www.outbreakdatabase.com/details/refried-beans-2005/>) and another was caused by the same toxin producing organism in Nevada in 2009 (<http://outbreakdatabase.com/details/nevada-restaurant-refried-beans-2009/>). This toxin induced illness, however, generally causes diarrhea rather than vomiting which is more characteristic of staphylococcal food poisoning.Refried beans (Spanish: frijoles refritos) (<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refried_beans>) is a dish of cooked and mashed beans and is a traditional staple of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, although each cuisine has a different approach when making the dish. Refried beans are also popular in many other Latin American countries. The name is a direct calque (literal, word-for-word, or root-for-root translation) of Spanish frijoles refritos, refritos meaning ""well-fried"", and not ""fried again"" as might be assumed from the use of re- in English. The prefix re- could be used as an intensifier in Latin, as evident in e.g. resplendent, a meaning that has been inherited by Spanish alongside the commoner meaning indicating repetition. In this dish, after being boiled and then mashed into a paste, the beans are sometimes then fried or baked, though usually neither, thus making the term ""refried"" even more misleading. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.]
