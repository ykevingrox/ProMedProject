Dame Sally Davies has written to all GPs and pharmacies to ensure they are prescribing the correct drugs after the rise of ""super-gonorrhoea"" in Leeds. Her warning comes after concerns were raised that some patients were not getting both of the antibiotics needed to clear the infection.Sexual health doctors said gonorrhoea was ""rapidly"" developing resistance. A highly drug-resistant strain of gonorrhoea was detected in the north of England in March [2015].
