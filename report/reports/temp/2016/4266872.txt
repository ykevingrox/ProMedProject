Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Epidemiological Update: Cholera [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=34811>Cholera in the Americas -- situation summary--------------------------------------------Since epidemiological week (EW) 1 of 2016 until EW 17 [week ending 30 Apr 2016], a total of 14 574 cholera cases have been recorded from 3 countries in the Americas: Ecuador (1), Haiti (13 859), and the Dominican Republic (714). Haiti alone registered 95 per cent of the total cases in 2016 in the Region of the Americas.Ecuador-------On 25 May 2016, the Ecuador IHR National Focal Point reported the confirmation of a cholera case in a 57 year old person, with an underlying clinical condition, from the city of Machala in the province of El Oro. The case was confirmed by the National Institute of Public Health and Research (INSPI) as _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. The strain was susceptible to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The epidemiological investigation found no other suspected cases. There was no increase registered of acute diarrheal disease in the city of Machala, at the province-level, nor at the national level. Nonetheless the investigation continues. The last autochthonous case of cholera was registered in Ecuador in 2004.Dominican Republic------------------In the Dominican Republic in 2016 as of EW 17 there were 714 suspected cholera cases reported and 16 deaths. The total number of cases in the 1st 17 weeks of 2016 exceeded the total recorded in 2014 (603 cases including 11 deaths) and in 2015 (546 cases including 15 deaths).Haiti-----In Haiti, the number of cases registered in the 1st 17 epidemiological weeks of 2016 exceeded the number of cases registered for the same period in both 2014 and 2015 (figure 1 - for figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]Cholera cases by select countries in the Americas, 2010-2016------------------------------------------------------------Year / Cuba cases (deaths) / Dominican Republic cases (deaths) / Haiti cases (deaths)----------------------------------------------------------------------2010 / 0 (0) / 191 (9) / 179 379 (3990)2011 / 0 (0) / 20 851 (336) / 340 311 (2869)2012 / 417 (3) / 7919 (68) / 112 076 (894)2013 / 181 (0) / 1954 (42) / 58 809 (593)2014 / 76 (0) / 603 (11) / 27 753 (296)2015 / 65 (0) / 546 (15) / 36 644 (321)2016 / 0 (0) / 714 (16) / 13 859 (150) (as of 30 Apr 2016)The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommends member states to maintain active surveillance systems for early detection of suspected cases and conduct the appropriate diagnostic laboratory confirmation of cases in order to provide adequate treatment and prevent the spread of cholera. PAHO/WHO encourages member states to continue their efforts to ensure and maintain adequate sanitation and access to safe drinking water, in order to reduce the impact of cholera and other waterborne diseases.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp[Maps of the 3 countries can be accessed atEcuador: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5074>Dominican Republic: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24>; andHaiti: <http://www.healthmap.org/haiti/>.- Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] HaitiDate: Thu 26 May 2016Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/haiti-cholera-update-nearly-six-years-later-72247/>The cholera outbreak in Haiti that began in October 2010, 10 months after the devastating earthquake that killed over 200 000 people and displaced over 1 million, still lingers on, albeit much less, on the island nearly 6 years later.In 2016 to date, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) has reported more than 16 000 cases, which have accounted for nearly 13 000 hospital admissions and 175 deaths.Since October 2010, the cumulative total cholera cases has topped 780 000 cases and 9300 deaths. It's been called the largest and most explosive cholera epidemic in modern times. And this cumulative number may be lowballing [underestimating] it, according to a recent study in the journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below], which reveals from house-to-house surveys in 4 communities that there were an estimated nearly 3 times more cholera deaths in the 1st 6 months of the epidemic than officially recorded.Prior to October 2010, Haiti had not seen a cholera outbreak in a century.[byline: Robert Herriman]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Reference----------Luquero FJ, Rondy M, Boncy J, et al.
