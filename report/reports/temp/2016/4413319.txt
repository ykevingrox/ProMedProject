The Citizen [edited]<http://www.citizen.co.za/1246962/more-rabies-cases-emerge-two-people-hospitalised/>The Randburg [Gauteng province] SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] has issued a rabies alert after 2 confirmed cases of rabies, Randburg Sun reports. 2 people are receiving treatment after testing positive for rabies.In a statement issued by the animals rights organisation, 2 people who recently tested positive for rabies were bitten in the Muldersdrift and Lanseria areas [Gauteng province], and were receiving treatment. The statement warned residents not to approach any jackals and to report such sightings, after 4 jackals and 2 domestic dogs tested positive for rabies.""It is vital as well as a legal requirement that pets have their annual rabies vaccinations. If your pet has not been vaccinated in the last 12 months please make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible,"" the statement read.The Randburg SPCA further warned that rabies is a fast-moving virus that must be treated immediately.Rabies signs to watch out for in your pet:- changes in attitudes and behaviour- changes in the bark- dropped jaw- excessive salivation- extreme excitability- fever- hydrophobia (fear of water)- paralysis- pica (appetite for non-nutritious substances)- seizures- shyness or aggression- inability to swallow--communicated by:ProMED-EAFR<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>[The alert mentioned ""2 confirmed cases of rabies"" adding that the said 2 people ""are receiving treatment after testing positive for rabies"". This is somewhat confusing: it would be helpful to note if the 2 bitten people are currently receiving post exposure preventive treatment, hopefully successful in saving them; or, worse, are indeed ""confirmed cases"", namely suffering from clinical rabies.Randburg is an area located north west of Johannesburg, in the province Gauteng (map at <http://tinyurl.com/hcycrdp>). The rabies situation in Gauteng was addressed on 22 Jul 2016 by Prof Lucille Blumberg, deputy director for South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (see item [2] in 20160725.4368053). She indicated that 10 rabid animals were diagnosed there -- 6 jackals, 3 cattle and a Great Dane dog that hadn't been vaccinated. According to her, a considerable number of people were reportedly exposed but fortunately received timely post exposure preventative treatment.The incidence of human rabies in South Africa during the last 10 years (OIE's statistics) seems to show, in broad lines, a downward trend:2006 - 312007 - 142008 - 152009 - 152010 - 162011 - 62012 - 102013 - 72014 - 62015 - 8In December 2015, an international conference, convened by the OIE and WHO, supported by FAO and GARC [Global Alliance for Rabies Control] was held in Geneva to discuss the global elimination of dog-mediated human rabies worldwide. They expressed the objective to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies in the participating countries by 2030.The next World Rabies Day is due 28 Sep 2016. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3070>.]
