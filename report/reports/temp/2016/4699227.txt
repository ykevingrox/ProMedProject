The total number of outbreaks and cases reported continues to increase and is now 406 (compared to 268 last week to 5 Dec 2016), in which 245 were wild birds (35 species affected), 155 farms, and 6 in captive birds. Since the last update (5 Dec 2016), Serbia is now affected by the HPAI H5N8 virus, declaring its 1st outbreak on 6 Dec 2016 following the identification of the virus in 6 wild birds on 2 Dec 2016.The HP H5N8 virus is also present beyond Europe. An outbreak of HPAI H5N8 was reported on 13 Nov 2016 in breeding poultry in Israel. The cases were also reported for the 1st time in Egypt on 30 Nov 2016 in 2 coots (_Fulica atra_), in Ukraine on 30 Nov 2016 in livestock (species unspecified), and in Tunisia on 1 Dec 2016 in 17 coots (_Fulica atra_) and 13 wigeons (_Anas penelope_). Iran identified 5 outbreaks in laying hens between 14-28 Nov 2016.The virus circulates also in Russia, with a reported case in avifauna in June 2016, 2 outbreaks declared on 13 domestic poultry farms (geese, chickens and guinea fowl), and one outbreak reported on 8 Dec 2015 in a laying hens breeder [charts & graphs not included].The mortality reported in breeding is variable depending on the species. For mono-species breeding, the mortality varied from 0.3 to 33 percent on (4) farms keeping exclusively _Gallus gallus_, around 20 percent in (2) turkey farms, and from 0 to 70 percent in palmipeds (out of 21 farms; this mortality is between 10 and 70 percent on 6 of these 21 farms).Despite the caution in the interpretation (time of intervention in relation to infection, epidemiologically linked breeding, which could be at the very beginning of infection, etc.), it should be noted that this strain appears to have an unusual virulence in breeding palmipeds.The 35 different species of birds infected in the avifauna in Europe with their families are:- Accipitridae: Buzzard, White-tailed Eagle, Eagle spp.- Anatidae: Green-winged Teal, Common Pochard, Tufted Duck, Common Goldeneye eye Swan Swan, Swan singer, Red-haired, Shelduck of Belon, Mallard,Whistling Duck, Gadwall, Common Eider, Goose spp.- Ardeidae: Grey Heron- Corvidae: Magpie, Hooded Crow- Dromaiidae: Emu- Falcon: Peregrine Falcon- Laridae: Black-headed Gull, Gull Huahine, Herring Gull, Gull Brown Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Yellow-legged Gull- Pelecanidae: Pelican spp.- Podicipedidae: Great Crested Grebe, Little Grebe- Rallidae: Common Moorhen, Eurasian Coot- Scolopacidae: Curlew spp and Green Sandpiper --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[An interactive map showing all HPAI H5N8 foci reported in Europe between 26 Oct-11 Dec 2016 is available at<http://plateforme-esa.fr/carte-interactive-de-suivi-des-foyers-h5n8>.HPAI H5N8 is currently known to circulate in at least 13 European countries. France has experienced, as of 14 Dec 2016, a total of 20 outbreaks since the start of the event.The following data are derived from OIE's WAHID archive, as of 14 Dec 2016:1.
