PAHO/WHO Zika - Epidemiological update [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=36436>Zika virus - Incidence and trends---------------------------------To date, 47 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus disease since 2015. In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases [Figure 1]. Since the last Zika Epidemiological Update of 22 Sep 2016, no additional countries and/or territories have confirmed vector-borne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in the Americas.Figure 1. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015-2016.

In the United States of America, an increasing trend of confirmed cases is reported in the state of Florida.Central AmericaIn Central America, the trends of cases observed over the last 4 weeks in Costa Rica and Panama is described below.The trend in Costa Rica has not varied much and continues to reflect a decrease in cases reported in the past 4 weeks; with a weekly average of cases reported during this period of 78 cases.In Panama, following a sharp increase in cases between EW 30 and EW 35 [23 Jul-2 Sep 2016], reports for EW 36 and EW 37 [3 Sep-16 Sep 2016] show a decreasing trend. However, it remains to be seen if the decreasing trend continues.CaribbeanIn Anguilla, following a downward trend between EW 32 and EW 36 [6 Aug-9 Sep 2016], an increase was observed in EW 37 and 38 [10-23 Sep 2016].In the French overseas territories of Saint BarthÌ©lemy and Saint Martin, an increasing trend of suspected cases has been reported between EW 35 and EW 37 [27 Aug-16 Sep 2016].In Sint Maarten, an independent state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, bordered to the north by the French territory of Saint Martin, an increase in confirmed cases has been reported in the last two weeks reported (EW 36 and EW 37 [3 Sep-16 Sep 2016]).Puerto Rico continues to demonstrate a declining trend in cases since EW 35 [27 Aug-2 Sep 2016]; this trend will continue to be monitored.Other countries/territories in the Caribbean also show a declining trend of Zika cases.South AmericaIn South America, all countries continue to report decreasing numbers of Zika cases.Congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infectionTo date, 16 countries and territories in the Americas have reported confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection, maintaining the same total since the last Zika Epidemiological Update of 22 Sep 2016.As of EW 35 [27 Aug-2 Sep 2016], Canada reported 2 maternal-fetal transmissions of Zika virus; one with severe neurological anomalies.As of 1 Sep [2016], a table with the number of confirmed cases of congenital syndrome is published on a weekly basis on the PAHO/WHO website and is available at<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12390%3Azika-cumulative-cases&catid=8424%3Acontents&Itemid=42090>.Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disordersIn comparison to the data provided in the Zika Epidemiological Update of 22 Sep 2016, Guadeloupe has reported an increase in cases of GBS, adding this country to the list of countries and/or territories that have reported an increase in GBS with Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS. In addition, Mexico has reported the confirmation of Zika virus in five cases of GBS. The rest of the countries and territories with reported cases of GBS remain categorized in the same manner as reported previously (Table 1).Separately, Puerto Rico has reported an increase in the number of deaths related to GBS bringing the total to 2.Table 1.

Incidence appears to be declining in the tropical Americas, but has been increasing in Florida, USA. It will be interesting to see if hurricane Matthew that just passed over the northern Caribbean islands and is now passing up the USA coast from Florida and northward bound, will affect populations of the vector mosquitoes _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_.A map of the Western Hemisphere showing the locations of the countries mentioned can be accessed at <http://www.yorku.ca/acc/maps/WesternHemisphere.png>. - Mod.TY]
