[Byline: Karishma Kotwal]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Iftar (from the Arabic for breakfast) is the evening meal when Muslims end their daily holy month of Ramadan fast at sunset. Muslims break their fast at the time of the call to prayer for the evening prayer.The etiology of this large outbreak is not stated but appears to be of relatively short incubation. Knowing what symptoms are present and whether a fever was found in those afflicted may be helpful. The short incubation illnesses are:- staphylococcal food poisoning (caused by the elaboration of enterotoxin by _S. aureus_ in food that has not been adequately refrigerated with a usual incubation period of 2-4 hours causing an afebrile illness, primarily with vomiting;- heavy metal poisoning (caused by the leaking of metals from drinks stored on metal containers with a very short incubation period of 30-45 minutes;- norovirus infection which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea and has a longer incubation of 24-48 hours but can be as short as 12 hours and unlike the other 2 listed can be transmitted from person-to-person.I would guess that this outbreak was caused by staphylococcal enterotoxin. - Mod.LLMaps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/309>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
