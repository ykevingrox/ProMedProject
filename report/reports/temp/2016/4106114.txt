Accordingly, the onsets of the 2 events are at approximately the same time. The precise timing is important since it would help in distinguishing whether the outbreak in Luanda, presumably an urban outbreak, spread to cause a secondary urban outbreak in Caluquembe or whether the original focus was a sylvatic outbreak starting in or near Caluquembe. These factors have implications for vector control.Caluquembe has an altitude of 5501 ft [1700 m], a wet season that begins in October, and a mean daily temperature in their wet season varying from 65-67 F [18-19 C] (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caluquembe>). Although these temperatures are on the cooler side of the evaluation, climate is rated ""subtropical highland variety."" Are these conditions conducive to _Ae. Aegypti_? Are there areas with lower altitudes in the vicinity that have warmer temperatures? It might be helpful to have input from people with experience in Angola to comment on these possibilities.The recent reports in ProMED indicate that yellow fever cases originating in Angola have traveled to Kenya and China, amply documenting concerns about possibilities for spread of the disease. For Angola, in addition to vaccination, appropriate vector controls are indicated.--Stephen J. Seligman, M.D.Adjunct ProfessorCasanova LabSt. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious DiseasesThe Rockefeller UniversityNew York, NY 10065<sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu>[Dr. Seligman touches on an important point: the vectors in this yellow fever (YF) outbreak. As noted in comments on recent ProMED-mail posts, no mention has been made of vector status or control in either of the 2 areas where the YF outbreaks are occurring. Information about the geographic presence and abundance of vector mosquitoes within and outside the areas of current YF virus transmission would be useful in assessing the risk of further spread of YF virus in the country. The impression given from the previous reports is that the YF control and prevention effort has been focused on immunization. If vector control has been part of that effort as well, it has not been mentioned in the reports we have received.Dr. Seligman is thanked for his comments.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map for Angola can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Yellow fever - Africa (24): Kenya ex Angola 20160318.4104819Yellow fever - Africa (23): Angola (HL) 20160317.4102488Yellow fever - Africa (22): Kenya ex Angola 20160316.4097945Yellow fever - Africa (21): Angola 20160315.4095607Yellow fever - Africa (20): Angola, Lebanese expats, fake cards susp. 20160315.4095387Yellow fever - Africa (19): Congo DR ex Angola, susp. 20160314.4093047Yellow fever - Africa (18): Angola 20160313.4090378Yellow fever - Africa (17): Angola 20160310.4084268Yellow fever - Africa (16): Angola 20160227.4053826Yellow fever - Africa (15): Angola, fake vaccine, SE Asia, WHO alert 20160224.4047041Yellow fever - Africa (14): Angola 20160223.4044335Yellow fever - Africa (13): Angola (HL) 20160219.4033812Yellow fever - Africa (12): Angola 20160213.4019319Yellow fever - Africa (11): Angola 20160211.4012749Yellow fever - Africa (10): Angola (HM) 20160210.4010453Yellow fever - Africa (09): Angola 20160208.4003005Yellow fever - Africa (08): Angola RFI 20160204.3995342Yellow fever - Africa (07): Angola (LU) RFI 20160201.3984228Yellow fever - Africa (05): Angola (HL) 20160129.3977685Yellow fever - Africa (04) Angola (LU) conf, RFI 20160127.3965357Yellow fever - Africa (03) Angola (LU) comment, RFI 20160123.3959897Yellow fever - Africa (02): Angola (LU) RFI 20160122.3958601].................................................mpp/ty/msp/mpp"
