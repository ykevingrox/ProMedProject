CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/11/antimicrobial-resistance-scan-nov-16-2016>A study today in PLoS One provides new evidence of the potential risk posed by livestock-associated, drug-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ - to hog workers and their families [1].The study, led by a team of investigators from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, builds on their previous research into the emergence of livestock-associated _S. aureus_ in hog workers, which is believed to be linked to the widespread use of antibiotics in hog production. Their previous study found that employees of industrial hog farms, and their family members, may be more vulnerable to nasal carriage of _S. aureus_, methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA), and multidrug-resistant _S. aureus_ (MDRSA). What they were unable to determine from that research was whether the nasal carriage prevalence of drug-resistant _S. aureus_ they found represented a risk for infection. That's what they wanted to find out in the current study.To determine the risk for infection, the researchers enrolled 103 workers from an industrial hog operation in North Carolina, along with 26 adult household members and 54 minor children. All participants provided a baseline nasal swab and completed a questionnaire. They were also asked whether they had seen symptoms, or been diagnosed with, a [skin and soft tissue] infection (SSTI) in the 3 months prior to enrollment in the study.Analysis of the nasal swabs found that 45 of the 103 hog workers (44 percent) and 31 of 80 household members (39 percent) carried _S. aureus_ in their noses. Nearly half of the strains carried by the hog workers, and nearly 1/3 of those carried by the household members, were drug-resistant. But the researchers also found that 6 percent of the hog workers and 11 percent of the children who lived with them had reported a recent SSTI. Furthermore, hog workers who carried _S. aureus_ were 5 times as likely to have an SSTI as those who didn't carry the bacteria, and those who carried MDRSA were nearly 9 times as likely to have an SSTI.While the study was small and the overall number of SSTIs was low among the study participants, the researchers say their findings are the first to show a relation between nasal carriage of livestock-associated _S. aureus_ and SSTIs among workers with frequent and intense exposure to hog production.""Before this study, we knew that many hog workers were carrying livestock-associated and multidrug-resistant _S. aureus_ strains in their noses, but we didn't know what that meant in terms of worker health,"" study leader Christopher D Heaney, PhD, MS, said in a Johns Hopkins news release. ""This study suggests that carrying these bacteria may not always be harmless to humans.""[Reference----------1.

However, whether LA-_S. aureus_ nasal carriage is associated with increased risk of SSTI remains unclear. We aimed to examine _S. aureus_ nasal carriage and recent (3 months or less prior to enrollment) SSTI symptoms among industrial hog operation (IHO) workers and their household contacts. IHO workers and their household contacts provided a nasal swab and responded to a questionnaire assessing self-reported personal and occupational exposures and recent SSTI symptoms. Nasal swabs were analyzed for _S. aureus_, including methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA), multidrug-resistant-_S. aureus_ (MDRSA), absence of _scn_ (livestock association), and _spa_ type.""_S. aureus_ with at least one indicator of LA was observed among 19 percent of 103 IHO workers and 6 percent of 80 household members. Prevalence of recent SSTI was 6 percent among IHO workers and 11 percent among 54 minor household members (0/26 adult household members reported SSTI). Among IHO workers, nasal carriers of MDRSA and _scn_-negative _S. aureus_ were 8.8 (95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 1.8, 43.9) and 5.1 (95 percent CI: 1.2, 22.2) times as likely to report recent SSTI as non-carriers, respectively. In one household, both an IHO worker and child reported recent SSTI and carried the same _S. aureus spa_ type (t4976) intranasally. Prevalence of _scn_-negative _S. aureus_ (PR [prevalence ratio]: 5.0, 95 percent CI: 1.2, 21.4) was elevated among IHO workers who reported never versus always wearing a facemask at work. Although few SSTI were reported, this study of IHO workers and their household contacts is the first to characterize a relation between nasal carriage of antibiotic-resistant LA-_S. aureus_ and SSTI. The direction and temporality of this relation and IHO workers' use of face masks to prevent nasal carriage of these bacteria warrant further investigation.""Introduction----------------""Over the past decade, animal-adapted strains of antibiotic-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ have emerged globally among food-producing animals, as well as among people who have contact with food-producing animals [1]. These _S. aureus_, which include methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant _S. aureus_ (MDRSA) strains, are commonly referred to as livestock-associated (LA-) _S. aureus_. LA-_S. aureus_ may spread from animals to humans through direct contact and through contact with animal dander, particles from decomposing waste [2], and aerosols generated by animal activity (such as movement, coughing, and/or sneezing) [3]. Clonal complex (CC) 398 is the most widely described strain, although CC9 is increasingly reported in Asia [4,5] and the United States [6,7]. Nasal carriage and infection with LA-_S. aureus_ has increased among individuals without livestock exposure in several European Union countries, suggesting that human-to-human transmission may now be occurring in the community, albeit at a lower rate than typical community-associated _S. aureus_ CCs [8-10].""Despite high prevalence of LA-_S. aureus_ nasal carriage among individuals occupationally-exposed to livestock [1] and increasing prevalence among some non-exposed populations [8,11], it remains unclear whether LA-S. _S. aureus_ nasal carriage is a risk factor for skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). Nasal carriage of hospital and community-associated _S. aureus_, which occurs among 20-40% of the general United States population, is an established risk factor for infection in the clinical setting [12]. However, LA-_S. aureus_ appear to differ from hospital and community-associated strains in that they typically lack genetic factors associated with human infection, including Panton-Valentine leukocidin- (PVL-) encoding genes, enterotoxin-producing genes, and human immune evasion complex (such as, scn) genes [13-15]. Their capacity for human-to-human transmission also appears to be lower than many widespread community- and hospital-associated _S. aureus_ CCs [16,17]. Most LA-_S. aureus_ infections present as SSTI, which are of concern to IHO workers who can experience lacerations, abrasions, and other skin injuries through their daily work activities [18,19]. Associations between LA-_S. aureus_ nasal carriage and SSTI are difficult to investigate through studies in clinical settings because many livestock workers lack regular access to medical care [20], and because nasal screening for _S. aureus_ is not typically conducted for clinical SSTI cases [21,22]. To date, prospective cohort studies of healthy volunteer hog production workers have not identified risk factors for SSTI other than livestock exposure [21,23,24]. Identifying an association between SSTI and nasal carriage, which can be managed through decolonization interventions [25], could help efforts to prevent _S. aureus_ exposure and associated infections among livestock workers and their household and community contacts.""[The full article with references and figures is available at <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165713>.]A discussion of livestock-associated (LA)- _S. aureus_ can be found in my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Staph. aureus (MRSA) - USA: (NC) livestock-associated, farm workers 20130715.1825814. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/235>.]
