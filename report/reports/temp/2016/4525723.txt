The Indian Express [edited]<http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/odisha-19-children-die-of-encephalitis-in-malkangiri-pig-rearing-3055286/> A 4-year-old girl died Wednesday evening and 2 other suspected encephalitis deaths were reported Wednesday [28 Sep 2016], taking the death toll to 19 children since 9 Sep [2016]. The deaths have been reported from Manasa, Goreiguda, Baliapari, Koimetla, Sangel, Anlaguda, Palkonda, Sindhiguda, Siadimal, Chitapari, Golaguda and Kopeguda villages under Malkangiri Sadar, Kalimela, Korukunda, Podia and Kudumuluguma blocks [Malkangiri district, Odisha state].All deceased children were aged between 2 and 8 years, with blood and cerebral fluid samples confirming 3 deaths as caused by Japanese encephalitis [JE]. The results for other samples are still awaited, though symptoms clearly indicated encephalitis.""This is the 1st time Japanese encephalitis has been confirmed in the district. So we are collecting more samples from villages in the periphery,"" said Malkangiri Chief Medical Officer Uday Shankar Mishra.With just one paediatric specialist in the entire district and less than half the sanctioned strength of doctors, the latest epidemic has posed a huge challenge to the health establishment here.""The problem is there is no particular course of treatment for encephalitis. All that we are giving is supportive treatment. We are hoping that the children may just survive,"" Mishra said.Health officials said the main reason of deaths due to JE and AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] in Malkangiri villages was due to rearing of pigs by villagers. ""The tribals live close to pig and cattle sheds. The outbreak of AES and JE starts during post-monsoon period when the density of the _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes increases. As the pigs are carriers [amplifiers] of the virus the villagers are at greater risk,"" said District Vector Disease Consultant Ajit Dalai.He said medical relief centres have been set up in the affected villages and measures, including fogging, for vector control and larvicidal application are being done.A farmer whose daughter died Wednesday said there were 10 or 12 families in his village Sudhiguda who reared pigs.Officials said from next financial year, the vaccine for JE is likely to be administered to the children.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of children dying of encephalitis in the district has increased from 14 reported 3 days ago on 26 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160927.4517725) to 19 in the above report. Apparently, some of these deaths are confirmed as due to JE virus infections and the remainder are suspected to be due to the virus also, but this report also mentions acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The report goes on to describe the importance of _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes and pigs -- all key actors in the transmission of JE virus. Vector control is mentioned, but is difficult to achieve long-term. The vector mosquito breeds in extensive wetlands such as rice paddies that are difficult to treat with insecticides. Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) occur frequently each year in this part of north eastern India. Vaccination campaigns are needed in areas where the virus is endemic.Unfortunately, AES is an imprecise category and includes JE and other possible but unconfirmed etiologies. As noted in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts of JE virus, mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors and pigs are amplifying hosts.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]
