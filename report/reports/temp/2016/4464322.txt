Daily Mail Online [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3771229/Six-suspected-meningitis-cases-near-Damascus.html>Six suspected cases of meningitis have been identified in a Syrian town near Damascus that is under siege by government forces, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday [2 Sep 2016]. The suspected cases were diagnosed in the town of Madaya between 3-30 Aug 2016. WHO has already evacuated 2 of those infected, a child and an adolescent. The UN agency said it was in contact with health officials about sending medicines and organising the evacuation of the other 4 suspected cases.An activist in Madaya, Abdel Wahab Ahmed, who works at a health facility in the town, told AFP that the mother and 2 sisters of the evacuated child had also become infected. ""The family has been placed in medical isolation in their home after 2 weeks of treatment with the only medicines available failed,"" he said.Several cases of meningitis are reported every week, according to WHO. Most of them are viral forms of the disease, which tend to be less severe than the bacterial form. WHO was not in a position to say on Friday [2 Sep 2016] which type of meningitis was suspected in Madaya.On 19 Aug 2016, the Red Crescent evacuated 18 people, including 13 sick children from Madaya, according to a doctor who treated the children. Among the children was a 10 year old boy who had been suffering from meningitis for a month. Under a September 2015 accord, all evacuations from the government-besieged towns of Madaya and Zabadani have to be done in parallel with similar evacuations from Fuaa and Kafraya.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Sat 3 Sep 2016Source: en.zamanalwsl.net [edited]<https://en.zamanalwsl.net/news/17807.html>Doctor Mohamed al-Yousef, director of the medical body in Madaya and Biqin, announced via a recording sent to Zaman al-Wasl that ""Madaya was plagued with meningitis due to [a patient's] whole family getting infected by it as well as the infection of medical staff in contact with the patients. Also, there are new cases on a daily basis.""Meanwhile, a private source told Zaman al-Wasl that there are 18 infected cases with meningitis in Madaya, mostly women and children, clarifying that the medical office in the town decided to put them in quarantine fearing more spread of the disease.Madaya suffers a suffocating blockade imposed mainly by Hezbollah mercenaries who surrounded the town with checkpoints and mines to prevent leaks of any medical supplies or food aid to thousands of besieged people. This has resulted in great deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the town and spreading death and disease due to malnutrition and lack of medical services there.The Madaya blockade has entered the 14th month, while 40 000 residents await international aid, which is insufficient to stop the suffering of the hungry and injured, according to a local source.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Fri 19 Aug 2016Source: Huffington Post [edited]<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-boy-with-meningitis-evacuated-from-besieged-town_us_57b73aabe4b0b51733a329db>For nearly a month, [an] 11 year old [boy] has been suffering from horrible pain caused by meningitis that his doctors in Madaya, Syria, lack the equipment and medicine to treat.Madaya is under siege by the Syrian government, so [the boy's] family in Syria and the United States have pleaded for help from aid organizations and lawmakers so he could leave the town to get treatment elsewhere.On Friday [19 Aug 2016?], their prayers were finally answered as the Syrian Arab Red Crescent evacuated [the boy] and 12 other children out of the besieged town and took them to Damascus for needed medical attention, [the boy's] doctor said.The news came less than 24 hours after The WorldPost 1st reported on [the boy's] condition. [The 11 year old boy] was suffering from severe meningitis in the weeks prior his evacuation. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a tweet that it was evacuating a total of ""36 humanitarian cases"" from Madaya and 2 government-held towns, Kafraya and Fuaa, in the north western province of Idlib.A local Syrian doctor, Mohamed Darwich, who had diagnosed [the 11 year old boy], told The WorldPost that [the boy] was among those evacuated to Damascus to receive treatment, along with children suffering from malnutrition and 2 babies with blood poisoning, according to AFP.For [the 11 year old boy's mother] and others in Madaya, a rural town on the outskirts of Damascus, starvation and a severe lack of medical and humanitarian aid are a part of daily life. An estimated 40 000 residents have been affected by food and medicine shortages in the town. The starvation and blockades persist despite multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at ensuring the delivery of aid to those in need, regardless of who controls the territory. There are 4.5 million people who live in regions of Syria that are hard to reach for aid groups, 400 000 of whom live in besieged areas, according to the United Nations.[byline: Rowaida Abdelaziz]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The news reports above say that several people have been diagnosed as having suspected meningitis in a small town near Damascus in the past month, most of whom were thought to have viral rather than bacterial meningitis. One child in the 2nd and 3rd news report, who is likely the same as the 10 year old mentioned in the 1st news report, was said to have ""severe meningitis"" causing headache for one month. This boy is said to have transmitted the illness to his ""whole family"" as well as medical staff in contact with the patients. However, the absence of clear clinical descriptions of the illnesses in these news reports makes a differential diagnosis difficult.A report, which appeared in 2014 (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25424959>), said that an 11 year old Syrian refugee girl living in Turkey for 3 months was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis type B, but other reports of meningitis in Syrian refugees could not be found in a brief scan of the internet. More clinical and epidemiologic information on the illness in these Syrian refugees in Madaya would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources.Madaya is a small mountainous town with a population of 9371 in the 2004 census located in southwestern Syria about 40 km (25 miles) north west of Damascus in the Rif Dimashq Governorate (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madaya,_Syria>).Maps of Syria can be seen at <http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>. - Mod.ML]
