[It] runs the country's sole treatment centre in the southern city of Nzerekore, where it has handled 6 of the 10 confirmed cases recorded since the outbreak was officially declared over in December 2015. ""Of 6 confirmed cases, 4 have died; one was discharged after recovery, and the 6th is still here,"" said ALIMA emergency coordinator Solenne Barbe. Barbe attributed the high mortality rate to the fact that the recent patients arrived too late to be treated with a good chance of survival.The newest confirmed case is an elderly man from Macenta prefecture to the north of Nzerekore, she said, thought to be a healer visited by one of the dead while still alive and infected with the virus. According to health authorities, the deceased man's wife and her children crossed the border into Liberia before she too succumbed to the virus. One son also died, while another remains under treatment in Monrovia.[Approximately 1500 people were vaccinated against Ebola in Guinea after possibly having had contact with one of the 10 cases. It cannot be known whether the vaccine prevented further spread, but it is good news that no additional cases have been reported and that this last case recovered from the disease. - Mod.LK]Liberia, quarantine-------------------20 Apr 2016 Liberia: 58 quarantined persons to be released<http://allafrica.com/stories/201604201251.html>According to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, 58 persons recently quarantined for observation at the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) are expected to be released on [25 Apr 2016] if they remain asymptomatic. Deputy health minister and chief medical officer of Liberia, Dr Francis Ketah, said: ""The 2 positive persons are undergoing treatment at the ETU, and I can give you the assurance that they are going to walk out of the Ebola Treatment Unit soon.""Vaccine, research----------------- 19 Apr 2016: 2-vaccine Ebola regimen shows promise in early-stage clinical trial<http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/nioa-ter041916.php>An immunization regimen using 2 Ebola vaccine candidates was safe and well-tolerated and induced an immune response in healthy adult volunteers in a Phase 1 clinical trial [This tests safety in a small number of humans. - Mod.JW].The Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine uses an adenovirus vector to deliver genetic material from Zaire Ebolavirus [EBOV], prompting the human body to make an immune response. The MVA-BN-Filo vaccine works similarly, using a modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector (MVA) to deliver the same Ebola genetic material, plus inserts for Sudan Ebolavirus, TaÌø Forest Ebolavirus and the related Marburg virus [MARV]. Adenovirus, a common cause of mild respiratory illness in humans, and MVA, a weakened version of vaccinia virus (a poxvirus), have been successfully tested as experimental vaccine platforms.The investigators found both the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo investigational vaccines were safe and caused no serious vaccine-related adverse reactions. All participants who received the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine 1st (the prime) followed by the MVA-BN-Filo as a booster vaccination developed and maintained antibodies to Ebola 8 months after immunization, and about 80 per cent of the same group also maintained vaccine-induced T-cells, which help the body fight infection. This sort of durable protection could prove important in areas with intermittent outbreaks of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] in order to provide baseline protection for the community. The vaccine regimens are being tested further in various clinical trials worldwide, including a [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)]-supported Phase 1 trial with Crucell Holland B.V., which is taking place in Rockville, Maryland, USA.Citation:ID Milligan, et al.

Using a novel approach designed to get rapid indications of a drug's effectiveness, the trial showed that, at the dose given, the drug did not improve survival compared to historic controls.Citation:Dunning J, Sahr F, Rojek A.
