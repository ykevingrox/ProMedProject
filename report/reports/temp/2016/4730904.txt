According to the patient, at least 40 people have been injured from monkeys (unprovoked) at Pashupati temple over the 2-day period (25-26 Dec 2016). Many of them were severely injured and were vaccinated against rabies virus.So far, the status of rabies virus infection in monkeys living in monkey temples in Nepal remains unknown. On average, approximately 3 to 5 monkey bite victims visit STIDH to seek medical care or advice each day. The Nepal government, however, does not provide rabies vaccines, especially to those who have been bitten or attacked by monkeys inside the premises of monkey temples (especially Pashupati and Shyambhunath Temple), despite recommendations by the WHO following monkey bite injuries.Unfortunately, other than rabies virus, people are unaware about the possible transmission of several other viruses (primate-borne viruses) from monkeys to humans as documented elsewhere [1].Reference1.

Free-ranging macaques have not been confirmed infected by rabies virus (however, post exposure prophylaxis should be considered), but they may be a source of many zoonotic agents.A survey conducted on rhesus macaques at another temple in Nepal showed high sero-prevalence levels of rhesus cytomegalovirus, simian virus 40, Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1, and simian foamy virus.
