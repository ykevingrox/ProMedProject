WHO situation report [edited]<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/205686/1/WHOsitrep_28Apr2016_eng.pdf>The Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) related to Ebola in West Africa was lifted on 29 Mar 2016. A total of 28 616 confirmed, probable and suspected cases have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with 11 310 deaths.In the latest cluster suspected to be related to viral persistence, 7 confirmed and 3 probable cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported between 17 Mar and 6 Apr [2016] from the prefectures of N'Zerekore (9 confirmed and probable cases) and Macenta (1 confirmed case) in southeastern Guinea. In addition, having travelled to Montserrado county (Monrovia), Liberia, the wife and 2 children of the Macenta case were confirmed as Ebola cases between 1 and 5 Apr 2016 (Table 6).The index case of this cluster (a female aged 37 from Koropara sub-prefecture in N'Zerekore) had symptom onset on or around 15 Feb 2016 and died on 27 Feb [2016] without a confirmed diagnosis. The source of her infection is likely to have been due to viral persistence in an Ebola survivor.More than 1000 contacts were linked to the 13 cases (including 9 deaths) in Guinea and Liberia. The 21-day follow-up period for all contacts was completed on 27 Apr [2016].In Guinea, the last case tested negative for Ebola virus for the 2nd time on 19 Apr [2016]. In Liberia, one remaining hospitalized case (a 2-year-old) is reported to be healthy, but a 2nd consecutive negative test is needed before he is discharged.The 42-day (2 incubation periods) countdown must elapse before the outbreak can be declared over in Guinea and Liberia. In Guinea, this began on 19 Apr [2016] and is due to end on 31 May 2016. In Liberia, it will begin following the 2nd negative test of the last case.The response to this outbreak was supported in Guinea by vaccination of contacts and contacts of contacts. This campaign began on 22 Mar [2016] and vaccinated over 1500 people.Risk assessment: Although all of the previous outbreaks have been stopped, the performance indicators suggest that the 3 countries still have variable capacity to prevent (care for survivors), detect (epidemiological and laboratory surveillance) and respond to new outbreaks (Table 7). The risk of additional outbreaks remains.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Ebola: reduced evolutionary rateDate: Fri 29 Apr 2016Source: Science Advances [edited]<http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1600378>Citation: Blackley DJ, Wiley MR, Ladner JT.

We demonstrate that, similar to the March 2015 flare-up associated with sexual transmission, this new flare-up was a reemergence of a Liberian transmission chain originating from a persistently infected source rather than a reintroduction from a reservoir or a neighboring country with active transmission. Although distinct, Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes from both flare-ups exhibit significantly low genetic divergence, indicating a reduced rate of EBOV evolution during persistent infection. Using this rate of change as a signature, we identified 2 additional EVD clusters that possibly arose from persistently infected sources. These findings highlight the risk of EVD flare-ups even after an outbreak is declared over.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[David Blackley of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and colleagues sequenced EBOV RNA directly from serum and oral swab samples of patients from the 2nd Liberian flare-up. They used ""epidemiological and genomic data to investigate the source of the 2nd Liberian EVD flare-up, centered in Margibi County during June to July 2015. [The 1st occurred in March 2015, resulting in 1 confirmed case; the 2nd started in June 2015, resulting in 7 confirmed cases.] We demonstrate that this 2nd flare-up, like the 1st, originated from a persistently infected source within Liberia. The viral genomes from the 1st and 2nd flare-ups were characterized by significantly low levels of genetic divergence compared to other viral genomes sequenced from samples collected from infected persons in Liberia during the epidemic, indicating a reduced rate of EBOV evolution during persistent infections.

To find out more about what triggered it, researchers led by David Blackley of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] isolated and sequenced viral genomes from infected patients.They found a striking amount of genetic similarity with other Ebola sequences from West Africa, indicating the flare-up ""was a continuation of the outbreak that began in 2013 and was not caused by an additional spillover event from an unknown, non-human reservoir.""Further analysis suggested this cluster was sparked by ""a persistent, sub-clinical infection"" in a woman who had previously had [EVD] with clear symptoms and appeared to recover.""It remains unclear ... how Ebola virus is able to lay dormant in an infected host, but ... the virus may replicate more slowly and persist in immune-privileged sites, such as the eye and testes, long after the acute, symptomatic phase of disease has occurred,"" the researchers wrote.Ben Neuman, a virologist at Britain's Reading University, said the study was ""a solid piece of molecular epidemiology detective work."" Derek Gatherer, an Ebola expert at Lancaster University, said it showed that the potential for the virus to become dormant in survivors and then be transmitted to others ""may be a rare but important factor in prolonging outbreaks.""Any small resurgences of Ebola infection ""could seed a fresh widespread epidemic,"" requiring intense public health efforts to contain and understand them,"" he added. - Mod.LK]******[3] Liberia, Sierra Leone, funding, NGO, research29 Apr 2016 Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone: Taiwan issues travel alert for Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone<http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201604290028.aspx>[Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Fri [29 Apr 2016] issued a yellow travel alert for Ghana, which it says is a possible target for terrorist attacks.

Vezeau told Cooper that Halyard's MICROCOOL gowns ""...would leak when we pressure tested them, especially at the seams."" Another surgical gown manufacturer (Cardinal Health) reported that ""77 percent of the [MICROCOOL] gowns tested failed the industry-recognized test on one or both sleeves.""

DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5b07939Abstract:""Microfluidic diagnostic devices have the potential to transform the practice of medicine. We engineered a multiplexed digital-analog microfluidic platform for the rapid and highly sensitive detection of 3-4 biomarkers in quadruplicate in 16 independent and isolated microfluidic unit cells requiring only a single 5 uL sample. We comprehensively characterized the platform by performing single enzyme and digital immunoassays, achieving single molecule detection and measured as low as ca. 10 fM (330 fg/mL) GFP in buffer and ca. 12 fM GFP in human serum. We applied our integrated digital detection mechanism to multiplexed detection of 1pM anti-Ebola IgG in human serum and were able to differentiate 3 common Ebola strains. To ascertain that the device can be applied in environments beyond clinical point-of-care settings, we developed a low-cost, portable hardware system to control and read out the microfluidic device and detected anti-Ebola IgG in ultralow volume whole blood samples to levels of 100 pM in a multiplexed assay format.""[Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.
