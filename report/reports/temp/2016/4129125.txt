The majority of patients acquiring this infection are over the age of 65, and all patients have a history of at least one underlying serious illness. At this time, the source of these infections is unknown and the Department is working diligently to contain this outbreak.As part of the outbreak investigation activities, DPH, and the CDC are conducting site visits and collecting environmental samples from both private residences and health care facilities. CDC is also assisting Wisconsin with testing of samples from a variety of potential sources, including health care products, water sources, and the environment. To date, none of these have been found to be a source of the bacteria.The Department has alerted health care providers, infection preventionists, and laboratories statewide and provided information as well as treatment guidance for this outbreak. After that initial guidance was sent, there has been a rapid identification of cases and healthcare providers have been able to treat and improve outcomes for patients.Wisconsin 2016 _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ outbreak:_Elizabethkingia_ infections believed to be associated with this outbreak reported to DPH*Case counts between 1 Nov 2015 and 30 Mar 2016----------------------------------------------------------------------Confirmed: 56Under investigation: 2Possible cases**: 4Total cases reported to Wisconsin DPH: 62Affected counties include Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sauk, Sheboygan, Washington, Waukesha, and Winnebago.There have been 17 deaths among individuals with confirmed _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ infections, and an additional 1 death among possible cases for a total of 18 deaths.
