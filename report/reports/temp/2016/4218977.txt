Because it's caused by a virus in the herpes family, it can stay in the body and reactivate later in life, causing shingles.The health department encouraged people to get vaccinated to help prevent the spread of the disease. Most of this year's [2016] cases -- particularly those that were part of an outbreak -- were in people who were not vaccinated.""The chickenpox vaccine is safe and very effective, and is required for school and day care attendance to help prevent the spread of illness,"" Dr Eden Wells, chief medical executive of MDHHS, said in a [Wed 11 May 2016] statement. ""It is important to know that, despite common misconceptions, illness from chickenpox can be severe and sometimes require hospitalization resulting in serious complications.""It is true, though, that chickenpox is generally less serious in children than in adolescents or adults. Adolescents, adults and people with weakened immune systems also have a higher risk for complications.A vaccine for chickenpox was licensed in 1995 and has since been recommended for kids. Since then, there has been about a 97 percent decline in the number of cases in Michigan, the health department said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone born after 1980 who hasn't had chickenpox should get vaccinated. The vaccination in children has been shown to be between 89 and 98 percent effective in preventing mild to moderate chickenpox disease and 100 percent effective in preventing severe chickenpox.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[One wonders if increased numbers of parents are not having their children vaccinated against varicella (VZV; chickenpox) or whether the increase in cases is due to breakthrough following vaccination.In individuals who have not been vaccinated with varicella vaccine, the rash is generalized and pruritic and progresses rapidly from macules to papules to vesicular lesions before crusting. The rash usually appears first on the head, then on the trunk, and then the extremities; the highest concentration of lesions is on the trunk. Lesions also can occur on mucous membranes of the oropharynx, respiratory tract, vagina, conjunctiva, and the cornea. Lesions are usually 1 to 4 mm in diameter. The vesicles are superficial and delicate and contain clear fluid on an erythematous base. Vesicles may rupture or become purulent before they dry and crust. Successive crops appear over several days, with lesions present in several stages of development. For example, macular lesions may be observed in the same area of skin as mature vesicles. Healthy children usually have 200 to 500 lesions in 2 to 4 successive crops.Breakthrough varicella is defined as a case of varicella due to infection with wild-type VZV occurring more than 42 days after varicella vaccination. With decreasing incidence of varicella overall and increasing varicella vaccination coverage, more than half of varicella cases reported in the varicella active surveillance sites in 2010 were breakthrough varicella. In clinical trials, breakthrough varicella was substantially less severe with the median number of skin lesions commonly less than 50; vesicular lesions are less common and the lesions are commonly papules that do not progress to vesicles. Varicella in vaccinated persons is typically shorter in duration and has a lower incidence of fever than in unvaccinated persons. Breakthrough varicella has been reported in both 1- and 2-dose vaccine recipients.(Excerpted/edited from <http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/varicella.pdf>). - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
