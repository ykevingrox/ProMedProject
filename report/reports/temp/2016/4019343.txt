The Guardian [edited]<http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/10/peru-indigenous-peoples-rabies-deaths-bats-achuar-villages>At least 12 people in remote indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon have died from rabies in recent months and several more remain sick after catching the disease from bats, a local governor said on Wednesday [10 Feb 2016]. Authorities were rushing to vaccinate people in native Achuar villages near the Morona river basin where the deaths have surged, said Fernando Melendez, the governor of the Loreto region.3 children were among the 12 dead, said Melendez.""The death of even one child is grave,"" Melendez said. ""Today the people of Loreto are living a tragedy.""Peru's central government was preparing a state of emergency to free up funds for additional vaccines and fly them into affected communities, which are far from roads, said the deputy health minister, Percy Minaya.Rabies deaths from bat bites are rare in Peru, where native Amazonian tribes tend to lack access to basic healthcare and emergencies can go unattended for days.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 11 Feb 2016Source: Yahoo News, AFP (Agence France-Presse) report [edited]<http://news.yahoo.com/rabid-bats-kill-12-children-peru-141425919.html>At least 12 indigenous children in Peru have died from rabies after being bitten by blood-sucking bats, which locals at 1st blamed on witchcraft, health officials said.The children, aged between 8 and 15, died between September [2015] and February [2016] in 2 indigenous communities in the Amazon region of Loreto, regional health official Hermann Silva said.""From the symptoms and medical reports it was determined that the 12 children from the Achuar ethnic group died from an outbreak of wild rabies,"" Silva told AFP.""The victims were bitten by blood-sucking bats, animals that drink blood, in the Yankuntich and Uncun communities in the jungle"" 1100 kilometers (684 miles) north of the capital Lima.She said indigenous local authorities told health workers that ""the community thought the children's deaths were due to witchcraft, and that was why they didn't report the outbreak in time.""The latest death of a child from rabies was reported on Wednesday [10 Feb 2016]. 2 other patients, a boy of 9 and a woman aged 22, were recovering from the illness.Peru's health minister Anibal Velasquez said on television that the government had declared a health emergency to get medical aid to the region quickly.Silva said vaccination teams had been sent urgently to the remote region.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These 2 reports are a little discrepant. While AFP reported all of the victims as children [report 2], The Guardian [report 1] cites regional governor Fernando Melendez saying 3 of the 12 dead were children. The victims all lived in jungle communities in the Amazon region of Loreto, near the Morona River basin, where basic healthcare is minimal.The AFP report also refers to 2 patients who are recovering from rabies. ProMED requests further information on these 2 cases. The only survivors of rabies received pre-exposure vaccination, with a single exception. Perhaps these 2 individuals had been vaccinated.It is a relief that no mention is made of exterminating the bats. Vaccination is a much better approach, as culling vampire bats has proven to be ineffective. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31015>.]
