Besides, the district livestock department also started vaccinating the cattle in the affected area, he added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Gopalpur is an Upazila of Tangail District in the Division of Dhaka, Bangladesh; see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopalpur_Upazila>. This is a fair distance from the outbreaks we have seen recently in Bangladesh. I fear that this may be indicating a repeat of the epidemic events of 2010. I hope I am wrong.The government response has been good. But they must try to persuade owners of sick cattle to not be so charitable and to contact their veterinarian to have a diagnosis before thinking of butchering any sick beast. And with adequate and appropriate treatment not all sick animals die. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153>.]
