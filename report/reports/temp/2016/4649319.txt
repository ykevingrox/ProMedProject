Corvallis Gazette-Times [edited]<http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/second-case-of-strain-b-confirmed/article_110ea1b1-53dd-5865-9a06-565ee27312d8.html>Two OSU [Oregon State University] students have been diagnosed with meningococcal disease strain [serogroup] B. Both cases involve Oregon State University students who are being treated for the disease at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Corvallis, and both were reportedly in good condition on [Mon 21 Nov 2016].Test results established the 1st case was strain [serogroup] B, but testing of the 2nd patient late last week [week of 14 Nov 2016] was inconclusive. Over the weekend [19-20 Nov 2016], a 2nd test performed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta determined that patient was infected with the same strain [serogroup] of the disease, according to Lili'a Neville, public information officer for Benton County. No additional cases have been diagnosed, Neville said.On [Fri 18 Nov 2016], OSU Student Health Services began offering vaccinations against the B strain [serogroup] of the disease to students under 25 [years of age] and is continuing to do so. ""We'll be communicating to students as they leave (campus) for the Thanksgiving [24 Nov 2016] holiday to continue to watch for symptoms,"" said Steve Clark, OSU's vice president for marketing and university relations.Meningococcal disease primarily afflicts young people. Most incoming students at OSU are required to be inoculated against 4 of the most common variants of the disease, but that vaccine does not protect against the B strain [serogroup].While the disease is not highly contagious, it is dangerous and can be fatal. To spread, it generally requires close contact with an infected person for a cumulative total of at least 4 hours. OSU and county health officials have been working to identify people who may have been exposed to the infected students and treat them with antibiotics as a preventative measure. ""We have about 230 on our list,"" said Charlie Fautin, deputy administrator of the Benton County Health Department. He said most of those people had been contacted and given antibiotics, but others have not yet been located.Symptoms of meningococcal disease include high fever, headache, stiff neck, exhaustion, nausea, rash, vomiting, and diarrhea. Anyone experiencing these symptoms is advised to seek medical attention right away.An outbreak of meningococcal disease at the University of Oregon early last year [2015] made 7 people sick and killed one student.Vaccinations against meningococcal disease-B are available locally beyond the OSU campus, Neville said, but they require a doctor's prescription.[byline: Bennett Hall]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Serogroups B, C, and Y are the major causes of meningococcal disease in the United States, each being responsible for about a third of cases (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>). In infants aged under 1 year, over 50 per cent of cases are caused by serogroup B and in people over 11 years of age, 75 per cent are caused by serogroups (C, Y, or W-135). Serogroup B meningococci have also been responsible for several outbreaks and isolated cases on US college campuses in the last 5 years (<http://www.nfid.org/idinfo/meningococcal/meningococcal-b-college-outbreaks.html>).In the current outbreak on the Corvallis campus of Oregon State University, genotyping will need to be done to establish if the strains of serogroup B meningococci isolated from the 2 student cases are closely related, which would establish an outbreak strain.Oregon State University (OSU) is a coeducational, public university; the main campus is located in the city of Corvallis in the Willamette Valley of the US state of Oregon (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University#Main_campus_.28Corvallis.29>). The university has a total student enrollment of 30 354, the largest among all Oregon universities.Last year (2015) ProMED-mail reported that 6 cases of invasive serogroup B meningococcal disease occurred in students at the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon, between 13 Jan 2015 and 19 Mar 2015 (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) fatal, college, sg. B, sg. B vaccine 20150531.3398946). Eugene is 47 miles (75.6 km) south of Corvallis. A 7th case associated with the University of Oregon occurred in a father of a student who visited the campus in May 2015. Presumably, if he was infected with the outbreak strain, he must have had contact with someone on campus who was a persistent asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier over a month after the last student case. 5 of the 6 student cases, including a case who died, had bloodstream meningococcal infections. At the time, the University of Oregon offered meningococcal serogroup B vaccination to the students. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20733>.]
