He added that the affected are responding to treatment.""The symptoms are just like CSM [cerebral spinal meningitis], but let me put on record it is not CSM. [The writer is likely referring to CSM due to meningococcus.] There are certain factors that may give rise for the bacteria to spread from a fellow to another. Usually causes ear infection, throat infection, and pneumonia,"" he added.Dr Michael Rockson added that the outbreak started around [24 Dec 2015] and called on infected persons to report quickly for treatment.""All things being equal, by close of 2 weeks, we should be able to overcome the epidemic,"" he said.[Byline: Mildred Europa Taylor]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Ghana can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Ghana.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/50377>. Tain District, where the pneumococcal meningitis outbreak is occurring, is one of the 22 districts of the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tain_District>). The northern region of Ghana lies within the African meningitis belt where outbreaks of meningitis, usually due to _Neisseria meningitidis_, occur during the dry season, between December and May. The African meningitis belt is sub-Saharan and extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. A map can be seen at <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/pdf/yellowbook-2012-map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis.pdf>.However, several studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may also cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season, especially in older children and young adults (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha> and <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>). _S. pneumoniae_ serotype 1 from a single clonal complex (ST 217) has predominated in several outbreaks, but other pneumococcal serotypes are also isolated. The case-fatality rate for pneumococcal meningitis has been high; over 40 percent of cases are fatal, regardless of age group.A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine could beneficial. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce carriage of serotypes of _S. pneumoniae_ contained in the vaccine and thus person-to-person transmission of these pathogens, which occurs by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. However, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was found to include serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) protective against only 8 percent of the isolates in one study in Burkina Faso (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.full>). The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar 13, which covers serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, may be more effective, but we are not told the serotypes of pneumococci causing this outbreak in Ghana. - Mod.ML]
