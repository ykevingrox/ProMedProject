Cameroon: falsified ciprofloxacin; ciprofloxacin 500 mg and 750 mg, both with batch number 150806, manufacture date 08/2015, expiry date 08/2018. Stated manufacturer: 'Jiangxi Xier Kangtai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.'By HPLC [high performance liquid chromatography] no ciprofloxacin was detected in the tablets.2. Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo: falsified nalidixic acid tablets BP 500 mg, batch number ET 082101, manufacture date June 2014, expiry date May 2017. Stated as 'Distributed by IDA Foundation Amsterdam' and 'Manufactured by: Pram-Inter Lab Ltd Ireland.' A pharmacist identified a tin of 1000 tabs in a hospital pharmacy and noted by visual inspection that this product was not from IDA.IDA Foundation denied it was their product but contact details for Pram-Inter Lab Ltd Ireland could not be found.By HPLC no nalidixic acid was detected in the tablets.Ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid are used to treat Gram-negative [bacterial] infections and their presence in 2 central African countries is alarming and risks treatment failure.See <http://www.epnetwork.org/en/programmes/pharmaceutical-services-capacity-development/quality-of-medicines-minilab-project>--Paul Newton<Paul.Newton@tropmedres.ac>[ProMED-mail thanks Paul Newton for the submission above on falsely labeled antimicrobial drugs with respect to source and quantity of drug. In fact, no drug was detected by HPLC in the tablets that were either labeled ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid.The distribution of substandard drugs has become a growing problem worldwide; substandard/counterfeit antimicrobials, especially antibiotics and antimalarial agents, are most often reported in less-developed countries (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/28/2/443.full>, <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4137817/>, and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK202527/>, ).Nalidixic acid, the first in the quinolone class of antibiotics, is active against Enterobacteriaceae and is used to treat urinary tract infection. Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class. Unlike nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin is active against _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and several types of Gram-positive bacteria, as well as Enterobacteriaceae. Ciprofloxacin has been used to treat a wide variety of infections, such as urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, typhoid fever, anthrax, and plague caused by susceptible organisms. The US FDA has recently advised that for patients with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those patents who do not have alternative treatment options because of disabling and potentially permanent drug side effects that can involve tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system (<http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm500143.htm>).The following is the statement from the Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network website, available at: <http://www.epnetwork.org/en/programmes/pharmaceutical-services-capacity-development/quality-of-medicines-minilab-project>.""Substandard and falsified medicines pose a serious threat to public health, especially in developing countries. Alarming reports have been published on the scale of this problem. EPN [Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network] member DifÌ m started supporting EPN members in 2010 to test the quality of medicines used in their facilities to see if they met the standard specifications. Today [there are] 14 users of the so-called Minilab form the DifÌ m-EPN-Minilab Network. They are based in Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, India, Ghana, Nigeria, and Burundi. There is a close communication to guarantee results are quickly forwarded to DifÌ m for further action and that the members receive follow-up trainings and re-stocking of the materials used.""In November 2015 the 2nd DifÌ m-EPN-Minilab-Workshop took place in Kampala, Uganda, hosted by EPN member Joint Medical Stores and supported by DifÌ m.""The meeting was led by Albert Petersen from DifÌ m. 24 participants from 12 countries attended the workshop that discussed topics around the quality of medicines, updates on the Minilab profile, challenges, results of 2015, and the 2016 Action Plans.""The main medicines that failed the tests were amoxicillin, cloxacillin, Duo-cotecxin [dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine], mebendazole, erythromycin, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, quinine, and griseofulvin. Most of these are antibiotics and antimalarials, which is very scary as they are among the most widely used medicines for treatment of infections and malaria.""Participants and the workshop organizers expected a broader range of medicines to fail the tests as often reported in the media. However the moderator explained that similar studies done on the quality of medicines showed the percentage failure to be in the same region that EPN found, around 5 percent failure rate. One such study is the Malaria Medicine Study, conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.""Also as a follow-up to the 2013 Minilab Workshop held in Limbe Cameroon, participants were introduced to new tools for raising awareness on Quality of Medicines targeting health care workers in church health institutions. The tools had been finalized by EPN and each participant was given the tools to take to their facilities. These tools included IEC [information, education, and communication] materials, posters, and PowerPoint presentations.""EPN presented a Course it had developed for raising awareness and knowledge on the topic of quality the Minilab Network adopted for use in their facilities."" - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>.][See Also:2015----Counterfeit medications - worldwide 20150502.33337032014 ----Malaria - Sudan: (DW), expired and counterfeit medicines 20141206.30156792013 ----Rabies - Philippines (05): (KA) counterfeit vaccine, alert 20131208.20992512010 ----Malaria - Africa: counterfeit drugs 20100209.04462008----Malaria - Africa: substandard & counterfeit drugs 20080508.1566].................................................ml/mj/mpp"
