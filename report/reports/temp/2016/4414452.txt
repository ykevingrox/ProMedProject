Globes [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, summ., edited]<http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001145581>The Ministry of Health warned today (Thursday, 11 Aug 2016) against the consumption of camel milk marketed under the name ""Chalav Bereshit"" (Hebrew for ""Genesis milk""). This followed the hospitalisation of 3 children in the Ichilov and Laniado hospitals due to brucellosis infection associated with the consumption of the said product. The brucellosis bacteria may be found in unpasteurised milk. The closure has, for unknown reasons, been delayed until the current brucellosis cases of the milk consumers.The Ministry's ""Sherut Hamazon"" (National Food Service) personnel of the Central District Health Department Office started today (11 Aug 2016) the destruction of about 4 tons [4.06 tonnes] of unpasteurised camel's milk from an unknown source. The Ministry warned the public against the consumption or use of milk or dairy products from unknown or unpasteurised milk or dairy products.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report includes the details of a camel milk plant regarded, allegedly, to be the only certified one in Israel, where pasteurisation is applied. The management of the said plant insists that the nutritional value of whole pasteurised milk matches the value of fresh camel milk.Brucellosis, caused by _Brucella melitensis_, has become a serious public and animal health issue during the last 5 years, culminating in 2014 to record numbers (see 20150801.3550984). In 2014, camel infection, followed by human disease, was reported as well (see 20140622.2558324).The camel population in Israel is estimated at 3500 (OIE 2015 data). The reported (high) milk quantities, mentioned in the above report, seem to need adjustment. - Mod.AS]******[2] Listeria in frozen French fries; (untyped) salmonella in sesame pasteDate: Fri 12 Aug 2016Source: Times of Israel [edited]<http://www.timesofisrael.com/frozen-veggie-maker-recalls-all-potato-products-amid-listeria-fears/>Recall by French fries maker Milotal comes a day after major tahina manufacturer said salmonellaå  tainted products had reached Israeli stores. Israel's Milotal Frozen Vegetables company on Friday [12 Aug 2016] called on the public to return all its frozen French fries, after lab tests found listeria contamination in the product.The Hebrewå  language news website NRG on Thursday [11 Aug 2016] quoted officials from the company as saying that there was no danger to the public since the low temperatures of the freezing process would kill any bacteria. But in a statement on Friday, Milotal said: ""Following further examinations by an external lab received today, and for the sake of prudence, it has been decided to expand the recall scale to all frozen chips products."" The statement extends the list of products the company is recalling to include all frozen potato products.The recall by Milotal came a day after the CEO of another major food producer, Salatey Shamir (Shamir Salads), said some of its tahina (sesame paste) products tainted with salmonella had hit the shelves, and most likely been eaten by Israeli consumers. Shamir is one of Israel's largest hummus manufacturers and the biggest customer of the Prince Tahina factory, which on Wednesday [10 Aug 2016] announced that its tahina was contaminated and recalled shipments sent to Israeli companies using it to make a wide variety of food products.Some 200 tons [203 tonnes] of Prince Tahina's paste were slated for destruction after Health Ministry inspectors said the product was tainted by the bacteria. Prince Tahina's recall came too late, Shamir Salads chief executive officer Ami Guy claimed on Thursday in an interview with the Ynet news website. ""The tahina supplier notified us too late. We've already been producing this [tainted tahina] for 10 days. We can assume that people have eaten from these products,"" Guy said.""In the wake of [Prince Tahina's] notice and in coordination with the Health Ministry and the National Food Service, company management decided to recall all products made with this ingredient,"" a statement from Shamir said on Thursday. ""We ask customers not to consume these products.""The list of products feared to be contaminated is as follows:All hummus products from the brands Shufersal, Yesh, Shamir, Asli, Hamutag, Delicatessen, Salatey Habait, Yohananof and Picnic, with expiry dates between 1 and 18 Sep 2016.All tahina products from the brands Shufersal, Yesh, Shamir, Asli, Hamutag, Delicatessen, Salatey Habait, Yohananof and Picnic, with expiry dates between 16 Sep and 3 Oct 2016.All eggplantå  tahina products from the brands Shufersal, Yesh, Shamir, Asli, Hamutag, Delicatessen, Salatey Habait, Yohananof and Picnic, with expiry dates between 1 and 18 Sep 2016.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Salmonella in saladsDate: Thu 11 Aug 2016Source: Jerusalem Online [summ., edited]<http://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/in-israel/health-and-environment/salmonella-tainted-israeli-salads-recalled-also-in-europe-22919>Salmonella scandal: contaminated products taken off the shelves in Israel and in Europe------------------------------------------------------------------The Knesset's Health [sic; should read State Control; see comment] Committee will hold an emergency meeting in order to discuss the recent incidents in which salmonella [bacteria] were discovered in Israeli foods. As a result of the contamination, thousands of products belonging to Shamir Salads were taken off the shelves today [11 Aug 2016], not only in Israel but also in Europe.Thousands of products were taken off the shelves today (Thursday) due to another case of salmonella contamination -- this time in packages of HaNasich tahina that were supplied to the company Shamir Salads. As a result of the discovery, one of the largest tahina factories in Israel was closed. While everyone is still trying to understand why reports of the contamination were so late to arrive, the Knesset's Committee announced it will hold an emergency meeting in order to discuss the 2nd salmonella scandal to take place in Israel within 2 days and to try and stop the next failure from taking place.The source of the contamination was located at HaNasich's tahina factory, where suspicions that the products were contaminated emerged as early as the end of July [2016]. The tahina factory's owner took responsibility for the failure, as a result of which 200 tons [203 tonnes] of salads were destroyed, but failures were also recorded at Shamir Salads' factory and at the Israeli Health Ministry.The investigation of the failures found that Shamir Salads did not inspect one of the main ingredients it uses in its products, and it is still unclear why the failure was not discovered somewhere along the production line. This was not the 1st time that Shamir Salads' factory has been involved in failures, and production was brought to a halt at the factory several times in the past.Meanwhile, the Israeli salmonella scandal reached Europe, where Shamir Salads are also marketed, as hundreds of European chain stores and supermarkets received an email instructing them to take Shamir Salads products off their shelves.[byline: Tom Dolev]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The salmonella-tainted cereals recall (see 20160806.4399003, 20160807.4399991) which has engaged Israel's media, consumers and politicians since 4 Aug 2016, was followed by enhanced control activities of the state's relevant authorities and subsequently to the concerning findings and measures described above.The State Control Committee of the Knesset (Israeli parliament) held an emergency meeting on the ""Cornflakes storm"" on Thursday afternoon, 11 Aug 2016. For those interested, the summarized discussion is available (in Hebrew) at <http://main.knesset.gov.il/News/PressReleases/Pages/press110816hg.aspx>.The following questions arise:1. Has _Salmonella_ Altona (the cereals contaminant) been identified in human patients?2. What was the source of the said contamination in the Unilever plant in (the southern city of) Arad?3. Has the _Salmonella_ species in HaNasich's tahina (sesame paste) factory and (secondary) Shamir Salads been serotyped?4. Has the said salmonella been shown to cause human infection?5. In case affirmative, some information on its pathogenicity would be helpful.6. Has the source of the (primary) contamination in the tahina factory been identified?Any data on the said requested issues would be appreciated. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.]
