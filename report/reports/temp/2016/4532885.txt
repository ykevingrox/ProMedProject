Infection occurs when water enters the nose, attacking the central nervous system.The 1st confirmed case of PAM at Townsville Hospital was an 18-month-old girl from a rural North Queensland town who presented with fever, seizures, and an altered level of consciousness. She died within 72 hours of being admitted to the hospital. Tragically, her older sibling who had died several years prior, was retrospectively diagnosed with PAM.PAM is fatal in 95 percent of cases and has proven difficult for doctors to diagnose, as the symptoms mirror those of bacterial meningitis.Australian Society for Infectious Diseases president Professor Cheryl Jones said it is vitally important for doctors in PAM-affected communities to be aware of the rare disease. ""Any acutely unwell child with a history of bore water exposure and signs of meningitis or encephalitis should be considered for PAM as a potentially life-threatening diagnosis,"" Professor Jones said. ""Families should avoid swimming or diving into warm fresh water or to hold their nose if this can't be avoided.""--Communicated by:ProMED-MENA from HealthMap Alerts<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[A review of the Australian experience with primary amebic meningoencephalitis has just been published:Nicholls CL, Parsonson F, Gray LE, et al: Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in North Queensland: the paediatric experience.
