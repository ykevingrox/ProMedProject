The worst cases are admitted to an air-conditioned ward for intravenous rehydration and drugs to reduce fever.Dr Abdullahi urged parents to bring children to hospital before their condition had deteriorated too much, as most children he was seeing were in very serious condition.AM spoke to Radio Ergo whilst in hospital for the 2nd day with her 2-year-old daughter. She decided to bring her daughter to hospital after her son, the girl's twin brother, died at home.""The twins had fever for the past week and they lost their appetite. When the boy died, people advised me to go to the city to get medicine for my daughter,"" she told Radio Ergo. She said her daughter was being given syrup and injections.AM said her other 2 boys and a girl were also sick at home in Barsanguni village, around 40 km [about 25 miles] from Kismayo. She left them behind as she could not afford the transport fares at 150 000 Somali shilling (USD 6.80) per person for all the children. She said she was worried that her other children were also infected with measles.The measles unit in the hospital, which is supported by Physicians Across Continents (PAC), has received more than 280 patients since the measles outbreak began at the end of September [2016]. The patients have been brought to hospital from areas under the control of Al-Shabab, where vaccination programmes have not been conducted for more than 6 years.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Jubbaland State of Somalia is an autonomous region in southern Somalia. Al-Shabab means The Youth in Arabic. It emerged as the radical youth wing of Somalia's now-defunct Union of Islamic Courts, which controlled Mogadishu in 2006, before being forced out by Ethiopian forces. Somalia has not had an effective national government for more than 20 years, during which much of the country has been a war-zone.Al-Shabab gained support by promising people security. But its credibility was knocked when it rejected Western food aid to combat a 2011 drought and famine.With Mogadishu and other towns now under government control, there is a new feeling of optimism and many Somalis have returned from exile, bringing their money and skills with them.Basic services such as street lighting, dry cleaning and rubbish collection have resumed in the capital.However, Al-Shabab continues to stage periodic attacks in both Somalia and neighbouring countries.

The individual is receiving medical treatment after being seen at the University of Michigan East Ann Arbor Health and Geriatrics Center on Thu 13 Oct [2016]. As a precaution, individuals who were in the East Ann Arbor Health and Geriatrics Center Thu 13 Oct [2016] between approximately 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. are advised to seek vaccination, if not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR). Vaccination is not necessary if an individual has a prior history of measles illness. Individuals born before 1957 are assumed to have natural immunity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""The MMR vaccination is extremely effective at preventing illness,"" says Jessie Kimbrough Marshall, M.D., MPH, medical director for Washtenaw County Public Health. ""While we urge all eligible persons to vaccinate, it is especially important for anyone who is unimmunized and has potential exposure to this case to vaccinate against measles immediately.""The measles vaccine is effective and safe. Having 2 doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart is fully protective. Having only 1 dose of MMR vaccine is approximately 93 percent protective. Those at highest risk are those who have had no vaccination. The vaccine is not typically given to children less than 12 months or to individuals with poor immune systems.However, infants as young as 6 months can be vaccinated against measles, if they have been exposed (or for international travel).The MMR vaccine is available through primary health care providers and at some local pharmacies. Individuals should contact their health care provider for advice. If concerned, individuals who are patients at the East Ann Arbor Health and Geriatrics Center and who were seen on Thu 13 Oct [2016] may call the main operator at the University of Michigan Health System, 734-936-4000, and a physician will be paged to provide guidance.Any individual with potential exposure to the identified case on Thu 13 Oct [2016] should monitor themselves for rash with fever for 21 days, or until Thu 3 Nov [2016].If you suspect measles, seek medical treatment as soon as possible.Measles-------Measles (rubeola) is an extremely contagious disease caused by the measles virus. Measles can cause complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Measles can also cause miscarriages or premature delivery in pregnant women.Symptoms--------The illness starts with a runny nose, red eyes, cough, fever and sore throat. After 2 to 3 days, tiny white spots may appear in the mouth. A raised, red rash appears on the 3rd to 5th day of illness. The rash typically starts on the face and spreads down the body and out to the arms and legs. The rash usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Symptoms start 7 to 14 days after being exposed to measles, and last 1 to 2 weeks.How is it spread?-----------------Droplets from the nose or mouth, through sneezing, coughing or speaking, spread measles.A person with measles is contagious for 4 days before and 4 days after the rash appears.Measles in Michigan and the United States-----------------------------------------In Michigan, there was 1 case of measles identified in 2015 and 5 total cases in 2014.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 189 people from 24 states and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles in 2015. In 2014, the U.S. experienced a record number of measles cases, with 667 cases from 27 states reported to CDC; this was the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000.The majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated.Measles is still common in many parts of the world including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa. Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.Other Sources of Reliable Measles Information---------------------------------------------The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <https://www.cdc.gov/measles/>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Michigan, United States, can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>. - Mod.LK]
