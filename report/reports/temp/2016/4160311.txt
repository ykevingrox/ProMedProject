The Libya Observer [edited]<http://www.libyaobserver.ly/health/leishmaniasis-cases-reported-libya>A total of 145 cases of leishmaniasis have been recorded in Bani Walid, the city's health authorities have reported. Bani Walid Health Center said there is a surge in leishmaniasis due to waste accumulation.The infected cases are increasing significantly and there is difficulty in providing therapy due to lack of medicines, the manager of the center Aymen Hawadi declared. ""The center received 10 doses from the National Center for Disease Control in Tripoli, and this amount is very small given the number of infected cases."" He added.Bani Walid is a mountainous town some 180 km [about 112 mi] southeast of Tripoli.Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of female sandflies.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] is endemic in Libya, with sporadic outbreaks. In 2006, over 7000 cases were recorded in 8 districts, with an outbreak of 3961 cases in Musrata, and the disease spread to non-endemic areas (el-Buni AA et al: ""Cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya: a study of the Yafran area. East Mediterr Health J. 2000; 6(5-6):884-7, available at <http://applications.emro.who.int/emhj/0605_6/EMHJ_2000_6_5-6_884_887.pdf>).In 2009, the prevalence of CL was 7.1 per 10 000 population. There is a vector control program that involves insecticide spraying, and regular rodent control is performed (Alvar J. et al: Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671, supporting file S54, available at <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671>).The current outbreak is most probably due to a breakdown of control measures under the period of civil unrest. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25713>.]
