The Kathmandu Post [edited]<http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-09-30/chikungunya-infection-found-in-chitwan-woman.html>At least 6 people from Darbesha VDC in Morang have been diagnosed with kala-azar (black fever) in Koshi Zonal Hospital.The disease is transmitted through the bites of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. The symptoms of this disease include weight loss, weakness, cough and fever that could last for weeks even months.After the spread of the disease, the DPHO has sprayed insecticides in 6 VDCs with sandfly infestation.As many as 115 people in the district were treated for kala-azar last year [2016].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Leishmaniasis is now only endemic in a few provinces in Southern Nepal bordering India, with one district reporting 5-10 cases per 10 000 population and the rest 1-5 or less than one (see map and graphs with annual reported number of cases: <http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/NEPAL.pdf>).A leishmania elimination plan for Nepal was adopted in 2005, aiming at reducing the number of new cases to less that one per 10 000 population before 2015. This has nearly been fulfilled.For recent literature on transmission dynamics, see: Hirve S et al. Transmission Dynamics of Visceral Leishmaniasis in the Indian Subcontinent - A Systematic Literature Review. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016 Aug 4;10(8):e0004896. However, a study of different models for leishmania eradication on the Indian subcontinent concluded that ""elimination of VL (incidence of less than one per 10 000) by 2017 is only feasible in low and medium endemic settings"" (Le Rutte EA et al. Feasibility of eliminating visceral leishmaniasis from the Indian subcontinent: explorations with a set of deterministic age-structured transmission models. Parasit Vectors. 2016 Jan 19;9:24).A worrying trend is the detection of urban transmission in Nepal (Uranw S et al. An outbreak investigation of visceral leishmaniasis among residents of Dharan town, eastern Nepal, evidence for urban transmission of _Leishmania donovani_.
