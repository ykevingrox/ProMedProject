Now both countries are working hard to return to growth and encourage investors and international partners to get behind a range of opportunities for wealth creation. In collaboration with the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), African Business takes a look at some of the lesser known business success stories in Monrovia, Freetown and beyond.Improvements made include:- After a decline in rubber prices, which caused many farms in Liberia to close down, for the 1st time businesses are investing in processing rubber on-site, opening up new export markets. - Less than 10 percent of Liberia's 10 000 kilometers of roads are paved, making the rainy season particularly challenging for transporting goods a challenge. Recently, the Monrovia-to-Ganta road was finished, aiding in transporting agricultural products.- Sierra Leone used to be one of Africa's biggest rice exporters but today the country spends around USD 160 million a year on importing foreign rice. The construction of 3 rice processing mills is giving farmers the chance to increase productivity.- Entrepreneurs in Liberia are benefiting from Monrovia's business start-up center, which is aimed at incubating innovative small businesses. An additional 1000 small businesses in Sierra Leone businesses are set to have access to a government-run agency to develop their operations.- Palm oil production is often inefficient. Mahmud Johnson, owner of J-Palm in Liberia, is committed to changing that by using otherwise wasted palm oil kernels to develop a range of products including soaps and beauty products.- The port of Freetown sits on one of the deepest natural harbors in the world and is equidistant between the coast of Brazil and major European ports, means the terminal has clear potential as a trading hub. A recent USD 120 million investment from Bollore Transport and Logistics has secured plans for a new berth to attract bigger ships, and capacity will jump from 90 000 containers to 750 000 a year.]Research--------10 Oct 2016: More Challenges From Ebola: Infection of the Central Nervous System<http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27707893>[Citation.Wong G, QuiuX, BI Y, et al. (2016). More Challenges From Ebola: Infection of the Central Nervous System. The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 2016, 214(suppl 3):S294-S296.Abstract.Cases of relapsed Ebola virus disease involving symptoms in the central nervous system are reminiscent of our past observations with some nonhuman primates (NHPs) that survived acute Ebola virus infection. We document our findings in detail here and suggest that this phenomenon can be further investigated in NHPs.]12 Oct 2016: Review on Ebola evolution in nature<http://andersen-lab.com/review-ebola-evolution-nature/>[The 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was of unprecedented size and devastation, but also stands a landmark for infectious disease genomics. By sequencing virus genomes directly from patient samples, scientists are now able to investigate how viruses evolve, transmit between individuals, and spread across country borders during outbreaks, directly informing infection control. While next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the transformation of much more accurate and fine-scaled epidemiological investigations and infectious disease surveillance, there has also been a lot of confusion about data interpretations and their limitations.In a Review published in Nature, we describe in detail the findings of the many genomic studies published during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic. We put particular focus on some of the main misunderstandings and limitations of NGS virus surveillance data, and describe how infectious disease genomics will play a key role in future outbreak response.]12 Oct 2016: Predicting Subnational Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic Dynamics from Sociodemographic Indicators<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163544>[Citation.Valeri L, Patterson-Lomba O, Gurmu Y, et al. (12 Oct 2016). Predicting Subnational Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic Dynamics from Sociodemographic Indicators. PLOS ONE, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163544>Abstract.- Background. The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has spread wider than any previous human EVD epidemic. While individual-level risk factors that contribute to the spread of EVD have been studied, the population-level attributes of subnational regions associated with outbreak severity have not yet been considered.- Discussion. By combining 2 common methods -- estimation of epidemic parameters using mathematical models, and estimation of associations using ecological regression models -- we identified some factors predicting rapid and severe EVD epidemics in West African subnational regions. While care should be taken interpreting such results as anything more than correlational, we suggest that our approach of using data sources that were publicly available in advance of the epidemic or in real-time provides an analytic framework that may assist countries in understanding the dynamics of future outbreaks as they occur.]Treatment---------12 Oct 2016. Trial offers mixed view of Ebola drug ZMapp<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/10/trial-offers-mixed-view-ebola-drug-zmapp>[A study [12 Oct 2016] in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that ZMapp, the promising treatment for acute Ebola virus disease, narrowly missed the statistical threshold but demonstrated high efficacy after being used on 72 patients during the 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.The study was a randomized control trial called the PREVAIL I, or the Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia. In order to be considered statistically significant and a viable treatment option, researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) needed to demonstrate that treatment with ZMapp (in addition to the current standard of care) was better than the current standard alone 97.5 per cent of the time. In these 72 patients, ZMapp demonstrated efficacy 91.2 per cent of the times.""I would view the results from this study in an optimistic light,"" said Richard Davey, MD the deputy clinical director of NIAID and the lead author on the study. ""We were able to show that there was a greater than 90 percent probability that the drug had efficacy.""ZMapp, 3 monoclonal antibodies directed against the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus, is an intravenous infusion based on body weight given 3 times, once every 3 days at the start of symptom onset. In non-human primate studies, it was shown to be effective at preventing death from Ebola.Fewer deaths in small trial---------------------------The patients were found in Ebola treatment centers and hospitals in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the United States. 21 of the 72 patients died, a case-fatality rate of 29 per cent. 13 of the 35 patients (37 per cent) who received only standard care died, while 8 of the 36 people (22 per cent) who received ZMapp plus standard care died.Patients were enrolled from March to November 2015. ZMapp treatment began within 12 to 24 hours of trial enrollment, and clinical status was recorded daily for 4 weeks, with a final check on day 58.""We were not able to enroll the desired number of patients,"" said Davey, who said that 100 patients in both the treatment and control arms of the study would have conferred greater power.7 out of the 8 deaths in ZMapp patients happened on or before day 4 of the trial, which was before the 2nd of 3 planned ZMapp infusions. Additionally, the authors of the paper note that ZMapp recipients likely received their 1st infusion after the 5-day window of symptom onset that conferred a higher survival rate in non-human primate trials.The Ebola outbreak that began in West Africa in 2014 was the largest in history, with 28 000 suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola and more than 11 000 deaths. But by the time the trial began, emergency public health measures were already reducing the number of cases.Davey said the fact that researchers were able to conduct a randomized control trial amidst the outbreak of such a lethal disease is in itself a victory. ""This can be a useful model for future diseases and outbreaks.""Mapp pharmaceutical, the makers of ZMapp, has a supply of the drug, which will be made available to Ebola patients in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea in an emergency access program once the drug has passed each country's regulatory approval processes.In their conclusion, the authors of the study note that the use of ZMapp could save as many as 15 lives for every 100 patients treated.][Byline: Stephanie Soucheray] [Submitted by Mary Marshall]13 Oct 2016: Study finds Ebola treatment holds promise, although results not definitive<http://www.dddmag.com/news/2016/10/study-finds-ebola-treatment-holds-promise-although-results-not-definitive>[Citation.

Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). ... more- Discussion. In this randomized, controlled trial of a new treatment for acute EVD, the posterior probability that ZMapp plus the current standard of care was superior to the current standard of care alone was 91.2 percent. The overall 28-day crude mortality was 15 percentage points lower among those assigned to ZMapp plus the current standard of care than among those assigned to the current standard of care alone (22 percent vs. 37 percent), which corresponds to a 40 percent lower relative risk of death with ZMapp. If sustained, a mortality difference of 15 percentage points would translate to approximately 15 lives saved for every 100 patients treated. However, this outcome fell short of the prespecified 97.5 percent probability for superiority. ... more][ZMapp is an experimental biopharmaceutical drug comprising 3 chimeric monoclonal antibodies under development as a treatment for Ebola virus disease. Two of the 3 components were originally developed at the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), and the 3rd at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases; the cocktail was optimized by Dr. Gary Kobinger, who was branch chief of the NML and is undergoing further development under license by Mapp Biopharmaceutical.Cautious optimism concerning ZMapp [from Wikipedia]. - Mod.LK]Funding-------15 Oct 2016 Sierra Leone: MPs ratify loan agreements<http://www.globaltimes-sl.com/mps-ratify-loan-agreements/>[The [Sierra Leone] Parliament yesterday [14 Oct 2016] ratified a total of 4 loan agreements, dated 4 Aug 2016, including the financing agreement Regional Disease Surveillance System Enhancement Project in West Africa (REDISSE), between the Republic of Sierra Leone and the International Development Association which was dated.The Ebola Recovery and Reconstruction Trust Fund [ERRTF] grant agreement between the Republic of Sierra Leone and the International Development Association (IDA), acting as administrator of the Ebola Recovery and reconstruction trust fund dated 4 Aug 2016, and the Dollar Credit Line agreement between the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone and Export-Import Bank of India, dated 11 Aug 2016. According to the Deputy Minister of Finance and Economic Development, Mohamed Vandi, the 1st agreement was USD 30 million, out of which USD 20 million is a credit and USD 10 million is a grant for a period not exceeding 32 years after a grace period of 6 years.The 2nd agreement was for USD 15.5 million and USD 10 million a credit and USD 5.5 million was a grant.The 4th agreement was a USD 78 million loan to be paid after 20 years with a grace period of 5 years.Mohamed Vandi said that when Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] hit the country in 2014, there was no method of disease surveillance between Sierra Leone and other regional countries. Mr. Vandi said the 3 agreements are geared towards addressing health related matters in the event there is an epidemic in West Africa, providing immediate emergency response, surveillance information system between human and animal system, providing laboratory systems, cross border monitoring and institutional capacity building.][This is a step in the right direction to build preparedness for future outbreaks of disease. - Mod.LK][Compiled by Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>. - Mod.LKMapsLiberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54> Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>][See Also:Ebola update (61): news, funding, economy 20161009.4547627Ebola update (60): news, research, economy 20161002.4531285Ebola update (59): news, research, funding 20160925.4514591Ebola update (58): news, research, funding, vaccine 20160918.4497393Ebola update (57): news, research, funding 20160911.4481043Ebola update (56): news, vaccine, research 20160904.4465145Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350See archives for older reports].................................................lk/je/ml"
