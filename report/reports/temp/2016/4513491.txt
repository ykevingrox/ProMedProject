Emerg Infec Dis. 23(1) January 2017 <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/1/16-1313_article>Human Enterovirus 68 - Netherlands acute flaccid myelitis; Enterovirus D68 activity in Northern part of the Netherlands, 1st case of AFM------------------------------------In June and July 2016, we identified 8 adults and 17 children with respiratory enterovirus D68 infections. 13 children required intensive care unit admission because of respiratory insufficiency, and one had concomitant acute flaccid myelitis [AFM]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of 20 sequences obtained belong to the recently described clade B3. This upsurge could indicate an active EV-D68 season, as highlighted by the epidemiologic curve, with a potential increase in AFM cases. Clinicians should be alert for EV-D68, its clinical implications, and the need for appropriate diagnostics, particularly in children who are admitted with respiratory failure to the ICU or with possible symptoms of AFM.Conclusions--------After the upsurge of EV-D68 in our region [Netherlands] during 2009 and 2010, we set up routine genotypic characterization for several viral pathogens, including enterovirus and rhinovirus, which is also offered to regional referring hospitals and healthcare institutions. Sequencing results are available within one week, which provides clinically relevant and epidemiologic information. This so-called REGIOTYPE strategy contributed to timely detection of EV-D68 in our hospital in 2014, as well as in 2016. We recognized a sudden reappearance of EV-D68 with a sharp increase of cases that could not be explained by a change in surveillance strategy.In line with previous outbreaks, mostly children were affected, and those with underlying pulmonary conditions seemed at higher risk for ICU admission (9). This upsurge could indicate an active EV-D68 season, as highlighted by the epidemiologic curve, with a potential increase in AFM cases. Clinicians should be alert for EV-D68, its clinical implications, and the need for appropriate diagnostics, particularly in children who are admitted with respiratory failure to the ICU or with possible symptoms of AFM.--Hubert G.M.

It has been proposed that this virus could be emerging alongside other viruses that have been tied to outbreaks of AFM in areas where polioviruses no longer circulate. 1st isolated in 1962, human EV-D68 is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses. Biologically close to rhinoviruses, it belongs to the enterovirus D species within the Enterovirus genus. Although it has evolved to target the upper respiratory tract, it has the potential to also affect the nervous system. In 2015, researchers in Colorado described what they believed was the country's 1st defined cluster of children presenting with acute flaccid paralysis or cranial nerve dysfunction that they are linking to an outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) [excerpted/edited from Medscape].See a HealthMap of Netherlands at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/104>. - Mod.LK][See Also:Acute flaccid myelitis - USA: human enterovirus D68 susp 20160923.4509548Human enterovirus D68 - Taiwan, Canada: acute flaccid paralysis 20160902.4461647Human enterovirus D68 - USA (CO) acute flaccid paralysis 20160728.43759802015----Acute flaccid myelitis - USA: human enterovirus C105 susp 20150707.34927712014----Human enterovirus D68 - North America (19): acute flaccid myelitis assoc. 20141203.3009452Human enterovirus D68 - Europe (02): France, acute flaccid paralysis 20141106.29352702013----Human enterovirus 71 - Australia: sub-genogroup C4a, acute flaccid paralysis 20130526.1738087].................................................lk/msp/mpp"
