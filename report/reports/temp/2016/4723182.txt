ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) News [edited]<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-21/measles-outbreak-concerns-after-unvaccinated-families-exposed/8139406>The WA [Western Australia] Health Department has warned doctors to be on the alert for measles after 2 new cases of the highly infectious disease were detected this month [December 2016].The 2 new cases have been identified in children from non-vaccinating families, sparking concerns that a number of other people could have been exposed to the virus in both Perth and rural parts of WA.It is understood the children were exposed to the disease through contact with a returned traveller, who contracted the virus overseas and was treated at the Midland Health Campus earlier this month [December 2016].WA Health Communicable Disease Physician Dr Donna Mak said it was a timely reminder for families to ensure their immunisations are up-to-date, particularly during the holiday season when more people make travel plans.""The measles vaccination is safe and highly effective,"" Dr Mak said. ""Children who are too young to receive the vaccination can still be protected from measles if their family members are fully vaccinated and they stay away from people who are not vaccinated.""Early symptoms of measles include a fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.Infections can be severe in infants and people with poor immune systems.WA lags on Aboriginal vaccination rates---------------------------------------Meanwhile, a new report has found WA is lagging behind the rest of the nation in its immunisation rates for Aboriginal infants and toddlers, 15 per cent of whom are not fully immunised.Despite improvements in recent years, WA's immunisation rate for Aboriginal infants and toddlers is as much as 10 per cent behind the leading jurisdictions.But the state's overall immunisation rate is above the 90 per cent national target and has improved by 1.15 per cent in the past 3 years.The number of children not fully immunised due to their parents' conscientious objections has also declined to less than 1.5 per cent of the state's population.The statistics, detailed in a report by auditor general Colin Murphy, showed immunisation rates for Aboriginal children had improved across most regions in the past year.But Mr Murphy found more work needed to be done to address the discrepancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous population.The report also showed immunisation rates were much higher in regional WA than they were in the metropolitan area, with as many as 1 in 4 children in some parts of Perth not immunised.Mundaring was identified as having the lowest metropolitan immunization rate, at 74 per cent, while the Cottesloe-Peppermint Grove area sat at 75 per cent.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of immunization of the Aboriginal population in Australia; see Patel M, Lush D: Measles vaccine effectiveness in central Australian aboriginal children vaccinated at or after eight months of age. Aust N Z J Public Health. 1998; 22(6): 729-30; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9848973>.AbstractAn outbreak of measles in central Australia in 1994 provided the 1st opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the measles vaccine given to Aboriginal children at 9 months of age since 1984. Children eligible for the study that was conducted in one community in the region were aged between 9 months and 10 years. 8 of the 109 eligible children developed measles. The only unvaccinated child also developed measles. Vaccination failures occurred in 7.8 percent (6/77) of children vaccinated between 8 and 11 months of age and in 3.2 percent (1/31) vaccinated after 11 months of age. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 93.5 percent. The level of vaccine uptake in central Australia is high and the last region-wide outbreak before 1994 occurred in 1981-82. If the age of vaccination against measles is to be determined by the average age of infection; the age of vaccination should now be raised to 12 months of age; this is the age at which Aboriginal children in all other states and all children in Australia are vaccinated.Maps of Australia can be found at <http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/456> - Mod.LK]******[2] USA (California)Date: Fri 23 Dec 2016Source: KPCC, SCPR (Southern California Public Radio) [edited]<http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/12/23/67527/why-are-a-handful-of-measles-cases-an-outbreak/>Measles is highly contagious, and it produces fever and rash in susceptible people who become infected.Los Angeles [LA] County's public health department said [Fri 23 Dec 2016] that it has confirmed 2 more measles cases, bringing to 9 the number it has identified in the outbreak that it says began a month ago.So why does such a small number of cases constitute an outbreak? Public Health says it declared an outbreak because ""the number of cases is definitely greater than expected and the majority of confirmed cases are epidemiologically linked.""The criteria for defining an outbreak depend on the particular disease. For ""uncommon conditions,"" the department says, an outbreak could be ""2 or more cases that are connected by social, environmental, or geographical circumstance.""The agency did not clarify whether it considers measles ""uncommon."" The disease was officially declared eliminated in the US in 2000, but there have been sporadic cases and outbreaks since then.For ""very rare"" diseases, like anthrax or Ebola, the occurrence of a single case could constitute an outbreak, according to Public Health.An increase of cases in a given time or location might be a ""cluster"" rather than an outbreak, if health officials don't confirm an epidemiological link, according to the department.In the case of an outbreak or a cluster, Public Health says it investigates to define linkages between cases, ""determines the magnitude of the problem and the threat to public health, identifies risk factors for infection, and implements preventive interventions."" That includes contacting and testing anyone who came in contact with those who got sick.The department notes that when a vaccine-preventable illness such as measles is involved, the declaration of an outbreak frees up federal funds to help in controlling the spread of the disease.In the current measles outbreak, the 1st person who got sick developed symptoms in late November [2016], the agency says.For privacy reasons, Public Health has not revealed the patients' ages or where they were infected. ""Some exposures may have occurred in public locations,"" the department says, adding that it's investigating those cases. If the department can identify and contact every individual who might have been exposed to the virus, it will not release information about these locations, it says. But the agency adds that if it can't reach everyone, it will make that geographic information public.Public Health issued a health alert to medical providers in LA County [Fri 23 Dec 2016], informing them of the measles outbreak and urging them to consider the possibility that patients with an acute rash and fever may have the disease.While the department says there have been sporadic cases in the past 20 months, this is the 1st measles outbreak in LA County since the one that began at the Disney theme parks in December 2014. By the time that outbreak was contained in April 2015, the California Department of Public Health had confirmed 136 cases statewide.At least 57 of the people who got measles in that outbreak were unvaccinated, according to the California Department of Public Health. LA County Public Health said [Thu 22 Dec 2016] that the 1st 7 cases in the current outbreak were all unvaccinated. It has not yet said whether either of the 2 new confirmed cases involved unvaccinated individuals.People with measles typically develop a fever, runny nose, cough, and a rash all over the body. In some people, measles can cause pneumonia, encephalitis, or death.The highly contagious disease can live for up to 2 hours on a surface or in the air in an area where an infected person coughed or sneezed. If an individual has the disease, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected, according to health experts. A person can develop measles up to 21 days after being exposed to someone else who has the disease.Infected people are usually contagious from 4 days before they develop a telltale rash to 4 days afterward.Public Health has more information on measles at <http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/measles/index.htm>.[Byline: Rebecca Plevin, Paul Glickman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The WHO defines outbreak as: A disease outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season. An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extend over several countries. It may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years.A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (such as bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated (<http://www.who.int/topics/disease_outbreaks/en/>).The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4259>.
