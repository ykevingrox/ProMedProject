KSFY [edited]<http://www.ksfy.com/content/news/South-Dakota-in-peak-transmission-period-for-West-Nile-virus-388670172.html>South Dakota is in its peak transmission period for West Nile virus [WNV] now until the end of August. According to the South Dakota Department of Health, 19 cases of the virus have been reported in counties across the state, including Beadle, Bookings (2), Brown (4), Codington, Davison, Douglas, Grant, Hamlin, Lincoln, McCook, Minnehaha (2), Spink (2) and Todd.Dr. Lon Kightlinger, state epidemiologist for the Department of Health, says residents can reduce the risk of transmission by taking precautions:- Apply mosquito repellents (DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535) to clothes and exposed skin. Limit exposure by wearing pants and long sleeves in the evening.- Limit time outdoors from dusk to midnight when Culex mosquitoes, the primary carrier of WNV in South Dakota, are most active.- Get rid of standing water that gives mosquitoes a place to breed. Regularly change water in bird baths, outside pet dishes, and drain water from flower pots and garden containers.People over 50, pregnant women, transplant patients, individuals with diabetes or high blood pressure, and those with a history of alcohol abuse are at high risk for transmitting West Nile virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Since its introduction into the USA in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in the lower 48 states including South Dakota. Cases of encephalitis from WNV infection have occurred in equine animals and humans since then. Last year [2015] there were 1360 neuroinvasive human cases with 119 deaths in the USA, with 11 neuroinvsive cases but no deaths in South Dakota. There is a commercially available vaccine available for equine animals, but not for humans. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/243>.]
