Last year [2015] was incredibly chaotic. I remember being in Kenema, Sierra Leone, last year. The one small ward for Ebola patients had already been expanded 2 times to make bigger and bigger wards, more and more space. I remember a particular day when myself and one other doctor from WHO, David Brett Major, gowned and went into the Ebola Treatment Unit. Our role was meant to be providing more technical support and assisting people, but we went in and found that, because of the nurses' strike and shortage of healthcare workers, there was just no one there. We had 50-60 patients with Ebola and just David and me to try and administer care. So obviously it was a very rough setting.""NOW: ""Now, a year later [2015], there is still an emergency. It is just a different emergency and maybe not as well recognized. I work primarily with a clinical group, so the emergency that I am working with these days is the many Ebola survivors. There may be up to 17 000 people who have survived, who we are learning still have lots and lots of problems. These are not only medical problems, like persistent pains in the joints, or eye problems, but also social problems and stigmatization. Many can't work, so lots of issues of food security.So it's still kind of an emergent issue for me, an emergent issue that we are trying to deal with, not an easy one, but maybe less in the public eye than in 2014, of course, when there were so many acute cases.""[By Daniel Bausch, Epidemic clinical management, WHO HQ Switzerland, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There is no new WHO Situation Report because there have not been any more cases in the last reporting week.

At triage, he was misdiagnosed as being Ebola-negative and sent home. Due to an Ebola ""sensitization"" campaign in the district, Sahr knew the risks associated with touching suspected Ebola cases but was confident in the hospital's judgment that his uncle was negative: ""A grip di pa; a fid am sup."" (I held my uncle; I fed him soup.) Sahr cared for his uncle and started showing similar symptoms himself the day his uncle passed away. By then, he was suspicious enough that Ebola was the culprit to warn his family not to come near him. Sahr then hired a motorcycle, rode to KGH, was admitted, and tested positive for Ebola. He was sent to the Ebola treatment unit (ETU) in Kenema since Kono still lacked such a facility. The ambulance was packed with 7 positive patients; 2 died en route. On arrival at the Kenema ETU, he panicked when he saw the red fences surrounding the suspect/confirmed zone: the rebels had attached red cloths to their weapons during live battles. Of the 14 patients sent to Kenema that day, only 2 survived. Sahr described it as the worst experience of his life, worse than any battle he had fought in the civil war: ""Insai di war, yu kin si yu enimi; Ebola yu nor dae si am.""

When CBP did screen for Ebola, ""multiple"" human errors made the data ""unreliable.""CBP also failed to check all boat passengers from EVD-affected countries who were traveling to the USA.Most U.S. Coast Guard [USCG personnel] helping check ports lacked up-to-date chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear training to handle the disease. For example, only 3 of the 95 Corpus Christie [Texas] USCG personnel had received such training.]Other CBP personnel failed to screen some passengers even though the passengers voluntarily disclosed that they were coming from Ebola-affected nations. CBP headquarters also only arranged for contracted personnel to take travelers' temperatures at the 5 US airports with the most passengers from Ebola-affected countries, while passengers landing at other airports were unchecked. When CBP and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided too few staff members to take temperatures, passengers were expected to do it themselves.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Human error again, but apart from passengers who failed to disclose they were coming from West Africa, it is likely that most of those who actually admitted they had arrived from there, and who might have been picked up by proper screening, would probably have been suffering from malaria, just like all the other false alarms in the USA and elsewhere, or else they were non-transmitters to their partners, like the Liberian who died in Texas and the American doctor who survived in New York. - Mod.JW]******[4] UK: Hunt for Ebola's wild hideout takes off as epidemic wanesDate: Tue 12 Jan 2016 Source: Nature News [edited]<http://www.nature.com/news/hunt-for-ebola-s-wild-hideout-takes-off-as-epidemic-wanes-1.19149>With the official end of Ebola transmission across West Africa anticipated on 14 Jan 2016, an epidemic that killed more than 11 000 people in 2 years [this figure is subject to reevaluation (WHO)] may be starting to fade into history. But that does not mean that Ebola has disappeared. The virus remains hidden in animal reservoirs and is almost certain to spill over into humans again.New clues to where the Ebola epidemic started-------------------------------------""We've got to focus on what could potentially happen next,"" says David Pigott, a spatial epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, UK, and that means uncovering the species that harbour Ebola in the wild to try to prevent deadly outbreaks in the future.It is no easy task. Since the disease 1st emerged in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) 40 years ago, efforts to trace the origins of the outbreaks, including the most recent one, have come up frustratingly empty. Wild gorillas and chimpanzees in central Africa have experienced occasional Ebola outbreaks. But like humans, these species are too ravaged by the virus to serve as its natural host. Experts say that a reservoir species is likely to harbour the virus only at low levels, and without becoming sick.The leading candidates are several species of fruit bat from across central and West Africa -- where all known Ebola outbreaks have originated -- that are often hunted for meat. A 2005 study uncovered Ebola genetic material in some fruit bats from Gabon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and detected Ebola antibodies in the blood of others. Marburg virus, which is closely related to Ebola, is thought to be transmitted by fruit bats.[Byline: Ewen Callaway]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[5] Prevention, research, drugs, vaccinesPrevention-------------11 Jan 2016 Gibraltar: Number Six allays fears after death of Filipino seaman<http://www.gbc.gi/news/number-six-allays-fears-after-death-filipino-seaman-31284>[The public has received reassurance from Number Six Convent Place (the headquarters of Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar and the office of the Chief Minister) that there is no cause for concern following the death of a Filipino seaman who was rushed into port last night [11 Jan 2016].

The provision of preventive malaria treatment to all contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease has thus been proposed as an option to prevent the onset of malaria fever and consequent inefficient allocation of ETU beds to patients with malaria, and exposure of these patients to Ebola virus. This study provides a very strong justification for public health providers responding to an Ebola virus disease outbreak to consider distribution of preventive malaria treatment to contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease, in the context of an emergency response to Ebola virus disease outbreaks in malaria endemic areas.""Citation: Carias C PhD, Greening B Jr PHD, Campbell CG, et al.

Virus like particles (VLPs) are viruses that have had some or all of their genome extracted. This doesn't mean they're powerless. Study lead Dr. Eleanor Fish informed Gizmodo that these VLPs can still get into cells. They can even, if their missing gene segments are added, multiply like viruses. But they only produce more VLPs, which cannot, on their own, reproduce and continue the cycle of infection. Since these viruses are not able to produce infection, they can be studied in a level 2 containment facility. A level 2 facility only requires ""doors that are self-closing,"" and smocks or lab coats that can be worn home, although it is ""not recommended."" That's a major drop in resource allocation.13 Jan 2016 USA: Engineered antibodies neutralize 2 deadliest Ebola virus strains<http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/engineered-antibodies-neutralize-two-deadliest-ebola-virus-strains/81252228/>[The bispecific antibodies effectively neutralized both EBOV (Zaire Ebola virus) and SUDV (Sudan Ebola virus) in tissue culture studies.

A Rapid Screening Assay Identifies Monotherapy with Interferon-B and Combination Therapies. _PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 10(1): e0004364_, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004364 Author Summary:Studies to evaluate the effectiveness of candidate antiviral drugs to inhibit Ebola virus infection have been hampered by the availability and access to level 4 containment facilities. Using a mini-genome model system that generates Ebola virus-like particles that infect cells, we have been able to screen a panel of candidate drugs for antiviral activity, under normal level-2 containment. We compared the activities of 8 different antivirals from 3 drug classes, including drugs repurposed for the treatment of Ebola: type I interferons and nucleoside analogs. Our data indicate that IFN-B is a potent inhibitor of Ebola virus, contributing to the decision to conduct a clinical trial of IFN-B treatment for Ebola virus disease in Guinea. Moreover, we identified that 2- and 3-drug combinations inhibit Ebola replication when administered 24 hours post-infection. Drug combinations have important implications for clinical use, since lower doses of each drug are administered, potentially decreasing side-effects and, based on different mechanisms of action, there is less likelihood for the emergence of drug resistance. These studies set the stage for both preclinical and clinical evaluation.13 Jan 2016 Russia, Guinea: Russian Health Minister: Guinea asks Moscow for Russian anti-Ebola vaccine<http://sputniknews.com/society/20160113/1033081706/vaccine-ebola-demand-health.html#ixzz3x9YuG3sK>[According to Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova, who spoke on Wednesday [13 Jan 2016] during a meeting with Putin, ""Russia has received a request from Guinea to start using the vaccine recently developed by Russia against Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Moscow is ready to respond.
