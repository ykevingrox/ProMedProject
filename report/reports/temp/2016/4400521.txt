The name of the vaccine is VSV-ZEBOV, which is an acronym for recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV). The virus can infect cattle and its clinical presentation is identical to the foot and mouth disease virus and the _Zaire_ strain of [Ebola virus disease (EVD).The grant is from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in the US Department of Defense through collaboration with the commercial firm NewLink Genetics. A USD 100 000 matching contribution from the state of Kansas' NBAF [National Bio and Agro-defense Facility] Transition Funds brings the total project funding to USD 2.4 million. The university's Biosecurity Research Institute will be used to conduct the project.]******[2]6 Aug 2016 Sierra Leone: A practical community-based response strategy to interrupt Ebola transmission in Sierra Leone, 2014-2015<http://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-016-0167-0>[Citation. ZhongLi ZJ, Tu WX, Wang XC, et al: A practical community-based response strategy to interrupt Ebola transmission in Sierra Leone, 2014-2015. Infect Dis Poverty. 2016 Aug 5;5(1):74.]Abstract--------MethodsFirst, community-level education on Ebola virus disease (EVD) prevention was launched for the community's social mobilizers in 6 districts in Sierra Leone beginning in November 2014. Then, from January to May of 2015, in 3 pilot communities, local trained community members were organized to engage in implementation of EVD prevention and transmission interruption measures, by involving them in alert case report, contact tracing, and social mobilization. The epidemiological indicators of transmission interruption in 3 study communities were evaluated.ResultsA total of 6016 community social mobilizers from 185 wards were trained by holding 279 workshops in the 6 districts, and EVD message reached an estimated 631 680 residents. In 3 pilot communities, 72 EVD alert cases were reported, with 70.8 per cent of them detected by trained local community members, and 14 EVD cases were finally identified. Contact tracing detected 64.3 per cent of EVD cases. The median duration of community infectivity for the cases was 1 day. The secondary attack rate was 4.2 per cent, and no 3rd generation of infection was triggered. No health worker was infected, and no unsafe burial and noncompliance to EVD control measures were recorded. The community-based measures were modeled to reduce 77 EVD cases, and the EVD-free goal was achieved 4 months earlier in study communities than whole country of Sierra Leone.ConclusionsThe community-based strategy of social mobilization and community engagement was effective in case detection and reducing the extent of Ebola transmission in a country with weak health system. The successfully practical experience to reduce the risk of Ebola transmission in the community with poor resources would potentially be helpful for the global community to fight against the EVD and the other diseases in the future.][compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps:Distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>.- Mod.LK][See Also:Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.3908196and other items in the archives].................................................lk/mj/sh"
