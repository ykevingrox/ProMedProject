Water is usually contaminated by the feces of infected individuals. Drinking water can be contaminated at the source, during transport or during storage at home. Food can get contaminated by soiled hands, during preparation or while eating.Beverages and ice prepared with contaminated water and fruits and vegetables washed with this water are other examples. Some outbreaks are linked to raw or undercooked seafood.Treatment of cholera consists of replacement of fluids lost, intravenous replacement in severe cases. Doxycycline or tetracycline antimicrobial therapy can shorten the course of severe disease. There is an oral vaccine available in some countries but it is not available in the US. Cholera prevention is the same as in other causes of traveler's diarrhea.Cholera, according to the World Health Organization, still infects between 3 million and 5 million people each year, killing between 100 000 and 120 000.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of the Democratic Republic of Congo can be seen at <https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2015/06/Decentralized-provinces-of-the-DRC-CDRC_DG002_122.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/51976>.
