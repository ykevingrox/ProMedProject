At the time of initial confirmation report, he was classified as a primary case, but unknown history of animal contact. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It appears as though there may be a slowing down in reports of newly confirmed cases, perhaps signaling the end of the nosocomial transmission in Buraidah, as well as elsewhere in the country, having had 3 consecutive days with no newly confirmed cases. The most recent newly confirmed case reported from Buradiah was reported on 1 Apr 2016, 5 days ago. This may be optimism on my part, but hopefully this decreasing trend will continue.This has been an active period, with 85 newly confirmed cases reported since 16 Jan 2016 (preceded by no newly reported cases during the period 1-15 Jan 2016). It will be interesting to see results of testing of camels in the areas where primary cases have been reported. It would also be of interest to learn the follow-up investigations of possible risk factors in those cases initially reported as ""under investigation.""Maps showing the locations of the newly reported cases, deaths and recoveries can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>.]
