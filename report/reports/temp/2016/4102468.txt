WHO Situation Report [edited]<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/204633/1/zikasitrep_17Mar2016_eng.pdf?ua=1>Zika virus microcephaly and Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome---------------------------------------------------Summary- From 1 Jan 2007 to 16 Mar 2016, Zika virus transmission was documented in a total of 59 countries and territories. Cuba and Dominica are the latest to report autochthonous (local) transmission of Zika virus on [14 and 15 Mar 2016], respectively. 5 of these countries and territories reported a Zika virus outbreak that is now over. 3 countries (France, Italy and United States of America) have reported locally acquired infection in the absence of any known mosquito vectors, probably through sexual transmission. - The geographical distribution of Zika virus has steadily widened since the virus was 1st detected in the Americas in 2014. Autochthonous Zika virus transmission has been reported in 33 countries and territories of this region. - So far an increase in microcephaly and other fetal malformations has been reported in Brazil and French Polynesia, although 2 additional cases linked to a stay in Brazil were detected in the United States of America and Slovenia. - In the context of Zika virus circulation 12 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases. - The mounting evidence from observational, cohort and case-control studies indicates that Zika virus is highly likely to be a cause of microcephaly, GBS and other neurologic disorders. Among the tasks ahead are to further quantify the risk of neurologic disorders following Zika virus infection, and to investigate the biological mechanisms that lead to neurologic disorders. - The global prevention and control strategy launched by WHO as a Strategic Response Framework encompasses surveillance, response activities and research, and this situation report is organized under those headings. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] USA CDC travel guidelinesDate: Sun 13 Mar 2016Source: Vaccine News Daily [summ., edited]<http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/stories/510700744-cdc-adds-eight-countries-to-zika-virus-travel-guidelines>The CDC recently added new countries to its travel guidelines concerning the Zika virus, warning people who travel to these regions that the virus is at large.

(conf.) 1 case. The 61-year old male traveller presented on 4 Jan [2016] with febrile illness, rash and arthralgia following a month-long trip to Vietnam. He spent the final 2 days of his travel in Hong Kong. His illness began 2 days after return to Israel making acquisition in Hong Kong unlikely. The most probable area of Zika acquisition in Vietnam is Ho-Chi Min City (Saigon). Zika virus infection was confirmed by blood PCR and positive IgM serology (Euroimmun) performed by the Central Virology Laboratory of the Israeli Ministry of Health at Sheba Medical Center. Dengue and CHIKV were negative by serology, PCR and dengue NS1.The presence of ZIKV was reported in Vietnam in 1963 (Pond WL 1963) although only 1/50 patients (2 percent) had serological evidence of infection based on a viral neutralization assay performed in mice. However, the current report is the 1st travel-related ZIKV acquired in Vietnam. The case illustrates that Zika is likely circulating more widely than officially reported and highlights the role of travelers as sentinels. GeoSentinel sites worldwide are reporting cases of Zika in returning travelers. Those visiting areas where _Aedes_ mosquitoes are present are advised to avoid day-biting mosquitoes to prevent dengue, Zika, and chikungunya.

Association between Zika virus and microcephaly in French Polynesia, 2013-15: a retrospective study. Summary-------BackgroundThe emergence of Zika virus in the Americas has coincided with increased reports of babies born with microcephaly. On 1 Feb 2016, WHO declared the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This association, however, has not been precisely quantified.MethodsWe retrospectively analysed data from a Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, which was the largest documented outbreak before that in the Americas. We used serological and surveillance data to estimate the probability of infection with Zika virus for each week of the epidemic and searched medical records to identify all cases of microcephaly from September, 2013, to July, 2015. Simple models were used to assess periods of risk in pregnancy when Zika virus might increase the risk of microcephaly and estimate the associated risk.FindingsThe Zika virus outbreak began in October, 2013, and ended in April, 2014, and 66 percent (95 percent CI 62-70) of the general population were infected. Of the 8 microcephaly cases identified during the 23-month study period, 7 (88 percent) occurred in the 4-month period 1 Mar to 10 Jul 2014. The timing of these cases was best explained by a period of risk in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. In this model, the baseline prevalence of microcephaly was 2 cases (95 percent CI 0-8) per 10Ûö000 neonates, and the risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection was 95 cases (34-191) per 10Ûö000 women infected in the 1st trimester. We could not rule out an increased risk of microcephaly from infection in other trimesters, but models that excluded the 1st trimester were not supported by the data.InterpretationOur findings provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of microcephaly in fetuses and neonates whose mothers are infected with Zika virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[In a comment on this paper also published in The Lancet on 15 Mar 2016 (<http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)00742-X/fulltext>), Laura C Rodrigues wrote, ""The finding that the highest risk of microcephaly was associated with infection in the 1st trimester of pregnancy is biologically plausible, given the timing of brain development and the type and severity of the neurological abnormalities. However, the absolute risk of 1 percent estimated by Cauchemez and colleagues is perhaps lower than expected. In the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, where the risk was highest, during the 4 months of the epidemic 2 percent of all neonates were notified as suspected cases of microcephaly, not only those born to women known to have been infected. Half of the suspected cases were confirmed by the presence of calcifications, other brain abnormalities, or both. How to interpret the data has been the subject of some debate. ""After the paper by Cauchemez and colleagues was written, Brasil and colleagues reported preliminary results for 72 pregnant women with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infections, recruited in Rio de Janeiro before fetal outcomes were known. Ultrasound images were available for 42 women, of which 12 (29 percent) showed abnormalities over the range of gestational ages at infection. 9 women had rash and viraemia in the 1st trimester, and microcephaly was detected by ultrasonography in 2 of these, which corresponds to 22 percent risk of microcephaly after symptomatic Zika infection in the 1st trimester.""These 3 different approaches addressed different questions: the risk in all neonates during the epidemic in Pernambuco and the risk in neonates from women infected with Zika virus in the 1st trimester of pregnancy in the other 2 studies (with clinical symptoms in Rio de Janeiro and independently of clinical symptoms in French Polynesia). As expected the estimates are different, but are they consistent with a single underlying risk or, alternatively, will risk be dependent on other factors, such as the presence of clinical symptoms or previous dengue infection? Further data will soon be available from Pernambuco, Colombia, Rio de Janeiro, and maybe other sites that will gradually answer these questions. The fast production of knowledge during this epidemic is an opportunity to observe science in the making: from formulation of new hypotheses and production of new results that will provide confirmations and contradictions to the refinement of methods and the gradual building of consensus. I expect we will teach our students about the production of science using examples from this Public Health Emergency of International Concern for many years to come.""******[5] Blood supply concernsDate: Tue 8 Mar 2016Source: Journal of Infectious Diseases Advancd Access [edited]<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/03/08/infdis.jiw089.full.pdf>Peter W. Marks, Jay S. Epstein, Luciana Borio. Maintaining a safe blood supply in an era of emerging pathogens. Abstract--------Coming shortly after outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya virus in related locations, the recent outbreak of Zika virus in the southern part of the Western Hemisphere is yet another reminder that infectious pathogens continue to emerge rapidly and can adversely impact the public health, including the safety of the blood supply. In response to Zika virus, public health measures that rely largely on donor deferral and sourcing of blood from non-outbreak areas until a blood donor screening test becomes available have been implemented to address the safety of the blood supply in the United States. However, a more universal approach to assuring blood safety in the setting of rapidly emerging infectious diseases is needed. --Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>
