Bio Bio Chile [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.biobiochile.cl/2016/04/11/agricultor-es-el-primer-fallecido-por-virus-hanta-en-la-region-del-bio-bio-este-anno.shtml>The Health SEREMI [regional Ministerial administrative unit] in Bio Bio confirmed a new case of an individual affected by [a] hantavirus in Los Angeles. The person is a 64-year-old man who died after being admitted to a health assistance complex in the city.The man is an agricultural worker in the Llano Blanco area who had the 1st symptoms of the disease on 1 Apr [2016]; however, on day 7, he went to the hospital and, although admitted, died a few hours later.This was confirmed by epidemiologist Andrea Gutierrez, who indicated that the man's 1st test was positive [for a hantavirus infection], later confirmed by the Public Health Institute.She added that this is the 3rd case of [a] hantavirus [infection] that has been registered in the Bio Bio region this year [2016] but the 1st with a fatal outcome.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is unfortunate that this individual did not seek medical attention early in the course of his disease and arrived in the hospital too late to receive effective treatment.The conditions under which this man acquired his hantavirus infection are not given, neither is it indicated whether there will be an epidemiological investigation of the area where he worked and resided. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>. - Mod.TY]
