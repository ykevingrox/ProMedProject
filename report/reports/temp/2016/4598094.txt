Food Safety News [edited]<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/10/more-than-1000-students-in-10-schools-hit-with-food-poisoning/#.WBeso2eV_cs>It began with school buses rushing vomiting students suffering from food poisoning to area hospitals -- that was the scene earlier this week [week of 24 Oct 2016] in King Williams Town in [Eastern Cape province] South Africa. Hundreds of grade school students were taken to 2 provincial hospitals as they experienced stomach aches and vomiting, just after eating their government-provided school lunches. Ambulances, school buses, and even taxis were used to get the students to hospitals. Then it got worse. More than 1000 students of all ages from as many as 10 schools had to be taken to 2 provincial hospitals, Bhisho and Gray.The dramatic event brought out Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle, Health MEC Phumza Dyantyi, and Education MEC [Member of the Executive Council] Mandla Makupula on the following morning to visit casualty wards at the 2 hospitals where the children were being treated for severe diarrhea. The food poisoning incident began with hundreds of grade schoolers from the Schornville Primary School in King Williams Town. On the school lunch menu, according to the Eastern Cape Department of Education, was a ""crumbly porridge"" known locally as ""umphokoqo,"" which may have been made with ""expired sour milk.""The grade school, with 1200 students enrolled, has confirmed the students likely suffered from food poisoning and an investigation involving both food and water sources is underway. They hope the investigation will confirm where the food poisoning originated. Samples of sour milk, water, and other foods have already been collected by health officials investigating the outbreak.Students were still being admitted to the 2 hospitals into the evening hours. One school official said some students began complaining about stomach aches even before going to lunch.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The 1st paragraph of this post contains ""stomach aches and vomiting, just after eating"" which suggests staphylococcal illness due to preformed staphylococcal endotoxin. However, the 2nd paragraph refers to ""severe diarrhea"" which is unlike in staphylococcal foodborne illness. We await more information regarding testing. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56411>.]
