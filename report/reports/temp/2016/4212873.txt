Its symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.The CDC said the ship had increased its cleaning and disinfection procedures. 2 CDC health officers and an epidemiologist boarded the ship during its stop in Baltimore, Maryland, last week [week of 1 May 2016].Portland mayor Ethan Strimling told the Portland Press Herald he learned about the outbreak just before boarding the ship for a tour on Sunday morning [8 May 2016].""I could see there were people wiping things down constantly,"" Strimling said. ""We got onto the elevators and they wiped the elevators down.""The Balmoral departed Portland Harbor at 4 pm on [Sun 8 May 2016] and is headed to Saint John, New Brunswick [Canada], the Press Herald reported.The ship set out from Southampton, England, on 16 Apr 2016 and is due to return on 20 May [2016].Fred Olsen Cruises did not immediately return a request for comment.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cruise ship: USA to CubaDate: Sun 8 May 2016Source: CBS News [edited]<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/historic-cuba-cruise-returns-us-suspected-norovirus-outbreak/>Passengers on the historic 1st cruise ship to Cuba in decades have returned to South Florida on Sunday morning [8 May 2016].The ship, the Carnival Adonia, part of the new Fathom fleet, will have to get a cleaning when it gets back because several passengers got sick while onboard. It arrived at the Port of Miami around 6:30 a.m.It was a week ago that the ship left South Florida on its journey to Cuba.This marked the 1st time in 50 years that a vessel has made its way to Cuba, making it a historic and important day for many passengers that took the trip.Cruise ships stopped crossing the Florida Straits from the US after a brief window in the late 1970s when President Jimmy Carter allowed virtually all US travel to Cuba. US cruises to Cuba once again become possible after Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro declared detente on 17 Dec 2014.While heading back to Miami, there were reports that several passengers were sick. 14 passengers reported being sick with stomach-related symptoms.Carnival released a statement confirming that 14 passengers were recovering, according to the doctor on the ship.It's believed that they were suffering from a norovirus but the cruise line has not yet confirmed that.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Disney lineDate: Thu 5 May 2016Source: Huffpost Travel [edited]<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/spencer-aronfeld/disney-cruise-line-passen_b_9841920.html>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 131 passengers and 14 crew members aboard Disney Cruise Line's Wonder ship fell ill to the norovirus last week [week of 25 Apr 2016]. The typical symptoms of the norovirus are very unpleasant and include projectile vomiting and diarrhea.Whatever policies and procedures Disney typically utilizes to prevent this type of disaster failed on this cruise, and I am sure they are scrambling to figure out where the procedure broke down. In December [2015], the ship had registered a nearly perfect CDC inspection score. Disney cruise ships are among the cleanest and safest and enjoy usually high scores when the CDC inspects their sanitary conditions. However, the Wonder is the 2nd oldest ship in the Disney fleet, and perhaps it is time to for Disney to consider an overhaul.While the official cause has yet to be determined in this case, typically outbreaks like these start with passengers spreading fecal-based germs on surfaces like door handles, tables, and stairway railings. The Wonder is the 10th ship to report an outbreak so far in 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[With cruise ship ""outbreaks"" regularly appearing in the news, awareness of norovirus -- an extremely common and highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis -- has been significantly raised.But norovirus does not limit itself to sea-going vessels. Norovirus spreads swiftly wherever there are many people in a small area, including nursing homes, restaurants, hotels, dormitories ... and cruise ships. The common cold is the only illness more common, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimates that there are more than 20 million cases of norovirus annually. Norovirus is associated with cruise travel simply because health officials are required to track illnesses on ships (and are not at hotels and resorts); therefore, outbreaks are found and reported more quickly at sea than on land.Norovirus is named after an outbreak that occurred in Norwalk, Ohio, some 35 years ago. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vessel Sanitation Program, ""noroviruses are a group of viruses (previously known as Norwalk-like viruses) that can affect the stomach and intestines. These viruses can cause people to have gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and the large intestines. Gastroenteritis is sometimes called a calicivirus infection or food poisoning, even though it may not always be related to food.""Though norovirus can be passed via contaminated food and water, when it comes to cruise ships it is typically spread through physical contact with ill people or surfaces/objects they may have touched. This includes shaking hands, caring for a sick friend or family member, sharing food or eating from the same utensils, and not washing hands after using the bathroom or changing diapers (the highly transmittable fecal-oral spread).In response to an outbreak of norovirus or a similar illness (the CDC requires cruise lines to immediately file a report when more than 2 percent of passengers report symptoms), crewmembers clean even more thoroughly than usual -- with stronger solvents. Buffet service often switches from ""help yourself"" to manned stations. You may see salt and pepper shakers disappear from tables. Beyond that, crewmembers distribute information to passengers onboard offering precautionary tips, as well as a heads-up memo at embarkation to travelers boarding a ship that had previously seen a high percentage of illness. And, as mentioned above, passengers who report symptoms may be quarantined to their cabins.There are also behind-the-scenes procedures that cruise lines must follow. For instance, medical officers are required to maintain illness incident counts for each voyage that involves a stop at an American port. They are also required to communicate to the CDC, within 24-hours of arrival at a US port, ""the number of passengers and crew members who reported diarrhea to the ship's medical staff"" during that voyage.In serious cases where outbreaks cannot be contained, cruise lines might actually pull a ship out of service for a few days so it can undergo a more thorough sanitization. These enhanced cleanings are generally coordinated with the CDC.(Excerpted/edited from <http://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=71>). - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
