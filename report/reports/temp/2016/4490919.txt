The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN) [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Anthrax-caused-jumbo-deaths-in-Similipal/articleshow/54321515.cms>The 2 elephants -- a calf and an adult -- whose carcasses were found near Gudgudia under Karanjia forest division in Similpal Tiger Reserve 2 days ago [13 Sep 2016] died of anthrax. Wildlife authorities confirmed it on the basis of blood test report. ""We sent the blood samples to Animal Disease Research Institute, Phulnakhara, Cuttack. The test report showed anthrax positive. The samples will be re-tested in Kolkata,"" said principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Siddhant Das.Suspecting anthrax, the authorities followed due protocol for the burial of the carcasses so that the infection does not spread. The carcasses were buried on the same day in presence of senior forest officers, said Das.The 17 year old elephant and the 4 month old calf were found dead in an agricultural field close to the Jharkhand border. ""Given the location where the 2 were found dead, we suspect, they strayed from Jharkhand. They might have contracted anthrax from Jharkhand,"" said the top wildlife officer.[byline: Riyan Ramanath V]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a description of Similipal Tiger Reserve, go to <http://www.indiawildliferesorts.com/national-parks/simlipal-tiger-reserve.html>.Photographs of Similpal can be seen at <http://www.similipal.org/> and of Karanjia at <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Karanjia.html>.The suggestion that the source of infection was in Jharkhand makes a lot of sense; see ProMED-mail posting 20160606.4264811.

This was verified by colleagues posted nearby and through newspaper reports (online versions). Unfortunately exact details were not available, including on the suspected case.
