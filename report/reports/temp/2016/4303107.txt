He said that by that time, the girl was in critical condition due to complications. ""The complications may have been caused by the delay in seeking treatment,"" he said, when met outside the state assembly sitting here today [22 Jun 2016].Dr Ghazali said that, currently, [the girl] and her 2 siblings have contracted the disease. He said the siblings were recovering at the Malacca Hospital and are out of danger.[Byline: Roshidi Abu Samah]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, the cause of diphtheria, is an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Diphtheria is spread from person to person, usually by inhalation of respiratory droplets expelled by a carrier or diseased individual. The organism infects the mucosa in the nose, pharynx, and larynx, where toxigenic strains produce a toxin and a thick adherent membrane, which can expand and obstruct respiration. The toxin is absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed throughout the body; it is responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis. Paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur up to 3 months after the onset of pharyngeal disease. _C. diphtheriae_-associated neurologic dysfunction usually resolves. Most deaths occur from asphyxia due to the pharyngeal membrane or from myocarditis. Without treatment, as many as 50% of patients can die from the disease. Even with treatment, about 10% of diphtheria patients die (<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/782051-clinical#b4>).Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters ""DT"") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, ""Td"") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap).In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm>). The fully immunized person who is exposed can become a carrier of the bacterium but may only develop a mild case, or may not get sick at all. But if not fully vaccinated, the risk of getting severely ill is 30 times higher (<http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccines/diphtheria>).For further discussions of diphtheria, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below.Malacca is a state in Malaysia and located in the southern region of the Malay Peninsula, next to the Straits of Malacca; its capital, Malacca City, with a population of almost 500 000 residents, is 148 km (92 miles) south east of Malaysia's capital city, Kuala Lumpur (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malacca>).
