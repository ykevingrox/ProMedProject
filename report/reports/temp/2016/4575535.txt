Medical Xpress [edited]<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-haiti-cholera-cases-hurricane.html>There had been previous indications that [hurricane] Matthew triggered a surge in new cases but conclusively testing samples had been difficult in the aftermath of the storm, WHO's representative in Haiti, Jean-Luc Poncelet told reporters in Geneva. With the testing system operational again, health officials have confirmed ""the majority of suspected cases,"" Poncelet said.Citing ministry of health figures, he said 773 cases had been registered between 9-15 Oct 2016.The UN has previously announced it was sending a million cholera vaccines to the impoverished Caribbean nation to try to control the epidemic. Since Haiti was devastated by an earthquake in 2010, around 10 000 people have died of cholera. The number of active cases surged to 300 000 in 2011, but had been brought below 30 000 in recent years.Before Hurricane Matthew struck in the 1st week of October 2016, more than 28 000 cases of cholera had been recorded in 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Haiti can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/caribbean/political-map-of-Haiti.gif>.

Of the total cases, 96.4 per cent were reported in Haiti. Table 1 shows the number of cholera cases reported in selected countries between 2010 and 2016.In the Dominican Republic, a total of 1069 suspected cholera cases, including 18 related deaths (case fatality rate: 1.7 per cent), were reported from EW 1 to EW 38 of 2016. As shown in Table 1 [below], this is almost twice the number of cases reported in 2014 (603 cases, including 11 deaths) and 2015 (546 cases, including 15 deaths), although the case fatality rate is lower than those registered in 2014 (1.8 per cent) and 2015 (2.7 per cent).In Haiti, a total of 28 559 suspected cholera cases, including 267 related deaths (case fatality rate: 0.9 per cent), were reported from EW 1 to EW 37 [1 Jan-16 Sep] of 2016. The number of cases and deaths reported up to EW 37 of 2016 exceeds the number of cases reported in 2014 and the national case fatality rate remains as high as reported in 2015; note, the case fatality rate in 2014 was higher (1.1 per cent). In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew seriously affected the departments of Grand'Anse, Ouest, Nord-Ouest, and Sud; this could result in an increase of cholera cases. A statement issued by the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP), following the hurricane, reported that as of 9 Oct 2016, there is a total of 117 (including 17 deaths) cholera cases in the Sud department and 166 cases (including 3 deaths) in the Grand'Anse department.Detailed information on the support the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) is providing in response to Hurricane Matthew in Haiti is available at <http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12574&Itemid=42136&lang=en> [in Spanish].On 23 Sep 2016, Mexico reported a confirmed case of cholera in the state of Nayarit. The case was laboratory confirmed as _Vibrio cholera_ toxigenic serogroup O:1, serotype Ogawa. 59 suspected cases were identified through an active case search carried out at homes in the surrounding blocks of the case's domicile. Samples were taken and analyzed and all resulted negative for _V. cholera_. Local and state health authorities carried out prevention and control activities including coordination between areas of Protection Against Health Risks to measure residual chlorine in drinking water networks, take food samples, carry out surveillance using the Moore swab, and establish health promotion measures.Table 1.

The earthquake destroyed much of the ability to deal with human waste and supply safe potable water. When _Vibrio cholerae_ was then inadvertently introduced into the country, the epidemic spread quickly in this population due to the lack of clean water in an immunologically naÌøve population and had continued over the 6 years since the beginning. Hurricane Matthew produced an exclamation point to the on-going epidemic in its wake as a dramatic exaggeration to the yearly increases related to the rainy season. The beat of this dismal epidemic goes on and will not stop until adequate funding is obtained to rebuild an infrastructure. - Mod.LL]
