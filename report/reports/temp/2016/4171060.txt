Clarin [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Alerta-epidemiologica-Tucuman-hantavirus_0_1561043934.html>After confirming the deaths of 2 people from hantavirus [infections], health authorities of the Tucuman Ministry of Health last night [17 Apr 2016] declared an epidemiological alert that covered the entire province for all health services, both public and private.The fatal victims are a woman and a man who frequented the rural area in the Burruyacu department in the north east of the department. Although these cases of infection happened in Burruyacu, the exact sites where the virus is present have not been established. The objective of the alert is to intensify surveillance and disseminate preventive measures.""This is something totally new for our province, and local cases of hantavirus [infections] have never been registered,"" stated Rogelio Cali, director of epidemiology of the provincial health system (SIPROSA; Sistema Provincial de Salud). ""This is not a disease that one contracts like the flu; rather, it happens when a person comes into contact with a certain type of rodent, which one does not encounter in urban or domestic settings,"" Cali explained.According to the national Ministry of Health, the symptoms are similar to influenza: fever, myalgia, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting and sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhea. After some days, there can be respiratory difficulty, which, if not treated in time, can cause death.The most frequent cause of transmission is inhalation in both open and closed areas where there are feces and urine of infected rodents that disperse the virus and contaminate the environment. Another means [of transmission] is direct contact with infected rodents (alive or dead) or with their feces or urine. A rodent bite also can transmit the virus. If there is any doubt [about one being infected], it is best to go to the closest medical center.SIPROSA issued a communication in which it explained that precautions are oriented to those people who are involved in activities in rural areas or who have contact with abandoned sheds where there could have been many rodents and to health professionals in teams of assistance in the territory. Meanwhile, the Tucuman College of Agronomists and Animal Scientists issued an internal alert taking into account the information of the Ministry of Health and recommended strict precautions using masks in storage areas and disinfection of the installations.--communicated by:Gustavo R BonzÌ n, MD<gustavobonzon@gmail.com>[Dr Gustavo R BonzÌ n is thanked for submitting this report.It is not clear whether the woman who died of a hantavirus infection is the same one reported on 4 Apr 2016 from Tucuman province (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160406.4143175). She was reported as being from Yerba Buena department, whereas the case above is from Burruyacu department. She was in intensive care at the time of the 4 Apr 2016 post, and it is unknown whether she survived. The 2 departments are relatively close to each other but not adjoining.Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not stated, given their geographic location and proximity to the mountains, it is likely to be Andes virus. This virus is endemic in western Argentina, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there sporadically.Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. No mention is made of the involvement of her family members. Her infection may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta.ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the environment where the woman and man worked and lived.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.A map showing the locality of the departments in Tucuman province can be accessed at <http://www.tucuman-ar.com/sturismo/provin/dmap.htm> and a geographic relief map at <http://www.maplandia.com/argentina/tucuman/capital/san-miguel-de-tucuman/>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4>.]
