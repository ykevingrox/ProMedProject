The number of probable cases, he added, was now at 23.Those 7 employees have not been interviewed by the health department, Solla said, adding that when they are, it would be unlikely that they would have known of carrying the infection while working. Solla added that to see whether those employees got sick from the food, they would have to test the food that has already been thrown out.""Common sense tells us no employee is going to say 'I was sick,'"" Solla said. ""It's very unlikely they're going to fess up.""Julian Rubio, CEO for Ajuua's, said the 7 employees who tested positive do not reflect on the cleanliness of the restaurant, referring to the 97 and 100 restaurant report scores Ajuua's got on 4 Feb 2016 and 13 Apr 2016, respectively.Rubio also said he was surprised to have 7 employees test positive. ""These employees never mentioned any signs of being sick or having any symptoms,"" Rubio said. ""We thought we were going to get everyone back negative.""Solla said the employees cannot return to work until after they received medical treatment for the salmonella and had another test come back negative. As for the cause of the salmonella outbreak, Solla said it was still not known and may never be known.""It could be 3 possibilities that come to mind: it could be food in the establishment that was left in a condition to proliferate the bacterium; it could be an employee or someone working in the establishment bringing it in when they are ill; or it could be a food purveyor,"" Solla said.[Byline: Nathaniel Miller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The source of this restaurant-associated outbreak of salmonellosis remains unclear. It is likely that most, if not all, of the food service workers acquired the salmonellosis from the restaurant rather than being the source of the cluster of cases. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
