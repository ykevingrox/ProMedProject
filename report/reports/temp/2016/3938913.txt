Iceland Monitor [edited]<http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2016/01/13/more_icelanders_diagnosed_with_syphilis/>The notable increase in the diagnosed cases of syphilis in Iceland in 2014 continued for 2015 when 27 people were diagnosed with the sexual disease.In 2015, 27 people were diagnosed with syphilis, 24 men and 3 women. Most of those who caught the disease were men through intercourse with other men. One of the women who was diagnosed with syphilis was pregnant and according to the report by the Icelandic Directorate of Health if undiagnosed, syphilis can cause harm to an unborn baby.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail has posted reports of the recent increased incidence of syphilis in many countries, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. However, the news report above does not mention the rate of HIV co-infection in the Iceland cases.The increased syphilis incidence has been attributed to a variety of causes that promote unprotected sex among MSM, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive ""party drugs"", multiple anonymous sex partners, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners, use of smartphone apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, that facilitate anonymous ""hookups"", etc. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones, and social networking sites can be found at <http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf>. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38>.]
