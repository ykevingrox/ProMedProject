It seems that one of the children contracted the virus during the holidays. The contagious infectious disease then spread through the Buikslotermeer School in Amsterdam-Noord. Parents of pupils were informed about the situation on [Tue 1 Nov 2016].The virus spreads through the feces of people. It is therefore believed that at the school the virus spread via poor hand washing after defecation.[Byline: Janene Pieters]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There are undoubtedly many more cases of hepatitis A at the school since most of the cases in children are either anicteric (without jaundice) or totally without symptoms. Universal immunization for hepatitis A would keep this from occurring. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4027>.]
