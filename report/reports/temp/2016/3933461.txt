COLI, TURKEYS, 2014**********************************************************************A ProMED-mail post<http://www.promedmail.org>ProMED-mail is a program of theInternational Society for Infectious Diseases<http://www.isid.org>Date: Tue 12 Jan 2016From: Antonio Battisti <antonio.battisti@izslt.it> [edited]The mcr-1 gene, which encodes transferable resistance to colistin, has been confirmed in commensal _Escherichia coli_ from Italy, in primary production of turkeys.The 1st confirmed mcr-1-positive isolate is among colistin-resistant isolates detected from the harmonised monitoring programme performed on cecal samples at slaughter in 2014, and aimed at estimating the AMR [antimicrobial resistance] prevalence in major zoonotic (e.g. _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter jejuni_) and indicator commensal bacteria (e.g. _E. coli_), according to the Decision 2013/652/EU.Isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for colistin above the epidemiological cutoff had already been reported to the National Competent Authority and to the EFSA [European Food Safety Authority] according to the EU legislation. The National Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resistance, IZSLT, Rome, Italy, has been investigating the genetic basis of colistin resistance.The 1st isolate with the confirmed mcr-1 gene was whole genome-sequenced in collaboration with the European Union Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resistance (EURL-AR), DTU [Technical University of Denmark]-Food, Denmark. It was a multidrug resistant (SMX-TMP-CIP-TET-CHL-COL-AMP) [sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim-ciprofloxacin-tetracycline-chloramphenicol-colistin-ampicillin] Sequence Type 30 _E. coli_, also harbouring the Plasmid Mediated Quinolone Resistance (PMQR) gene qnrB19 (CIP MIC [minimal inhibitory concentration] 0.5 mg/L). Further investigation on colistin-resistant isolates from animal primary productions is ongoing.--Communicated by:Antonio BattistiIstituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della ToscanaRome, Italy<antonio.battisti@izslt.it>[ProMED-mail thanks Antonio Battisti for submitting the above data. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>.][See Also:Antibiotic resistance - Canada: colistin, MCR-1, E. coli, grd. beef, human, 2010 20160106.39158912015----Antibiotic resistance: colistin, MCR-1, multi-continent spread, human, animal 20151219.3875812Antibiotic resistance - Netherlands: colistin, MCR-1, salmonella, poultry meat 20151217.3870429Antibiotic resistance - Denmark: colistin, MCR-1, salmonella, human, chicken, RFI 20151206.3844715Antibiotic resistance - UAE: panresist.
