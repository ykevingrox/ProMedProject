Rick Scott made the announcement during a press conference Friday after a health department investigation into four suspected cases in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. He said transmission was confined to a small neighborhood just north of Miami.""We learned today that four people in our state likely have the Zika virus as a result of a mosquito bite,"" he said. ""All four of these people live in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, and the Florida Department of Health believes that active transmissions of this virus could be occurring in one small area in Miami.""[These are the 1st locally mosquito transmitted Zika virus infections in the continental USA. Reports suggest a very small area of transmission at this point, but the situation is likely to change and will likely parallel prior instances of autochthonous dengue transmission in Florida. At this point, mosquitoes in the area have not been found with Zika, but the epidemiologic evidence is compelling and the occurrence is not surprising. - Mod.TY/LM]Central America---Honduras. 26 Jul 2016.

Euro Surveill. 2016; 21(30): pii=30302.----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Advantages of testing for Zika virus (ZIKV) in urine have been reported, such as the persistence of ZIKV in this type of specimen for up to 20 days after ZIKV disease onset. We investigate 61 patients in the 1st 5 days post-symptom onset and find more patients testing positive for ZIKV in plasma samples (n=46), than in corresponding urine samples (n=37). For patients respectively testing positive in both plasma and urine (n=28), respective viral loads appeared similar.Discussion----------In our study, we focused on the detection of ZIKV in samples from 61 patients collected within the 1st 5 days of symptom onset. In contrast to the 2 previous studies mentioned above, patients in our study had an overall a higher ZIKV detection rate in plasma than in urine during active infection. Moreover, our data do not support the recent finding of higher level of ZIKV RNA in urine than in serum during the acute phase of the disease. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear, although this might have been due to the small number of patients investigated in all 3 studies. Another hypothesis could be that host immune and genetic factors might affect the viral load of ZIKV in distinct body fluids, whereby this may vary among individuals. A similar suggestion has been reported in cases of infection with dengue virus, another flavivirus. In this respect, patients in our study were Brazilian citizens, while the 2 other studies investigated patients from French Polynesia and travellers returning to the USA. Previous infection with other flaviviruses might also alter and/or enhance the replication of ZIKV in specific organs. Information about past dengue infection was however not available for our patients. Finally, beside the small sample size, one limitation of our study was the cross-sectional design that only permitted obtaining data at single time points.In conclusion, we recommend the simultaneous testing of blood and urine samples in ZIKV infected individuals with focus on plasma samples in the 1st 5 days of infection. Further investigations will be required to more fully determine factors influencing ZIKV pathogenesis.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Simultaneous testing of blood and urine for Zika virus RNA appears to be a good diagnostic practice. It would have been interesting to know if the patients in this study had been tested for presence of antibody to other flaviviruses that might have provided some measure of cross-reaction with Zika virus that might have influenced the result with cross protection reducing circulating virus. - Mod.TY]******[3] Zika antibodieDate: Wed 27 Jul 2016Source: EurekAlert!, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) [edited]<http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-07/wuso-ait072516.php>Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis [Missouri] have identified antibodies capable of protecting against Zika virus infection, a significant step toward developing a vaccine, better diagnostic tests, and possibly new antibody-based therapies. The work, in mice, helps clarify recent research that also identified protective Zika antibodies but lacked important details on how the antibodies interact with the virus.In a study published 27 Jul [2016] in Cell, the researchers identified the precise spot on the virus that the antibodies recognized, information that could be used to develop a vaccine against Zika. The antibodies bound exclusively to Zika and not to related viruses, which means they are specific enough to be used in diagnostic tests.""Importantly, some of our antibodies are able to neutralize African, Asian, and American strains of Zika virus to about the same degree,"" said Daved Fremont, PhD, a professor of pathology and immunology and a co-senior author on the paper. A vaccine designed to elicit similar antibodies might be able to protect people from Zika strains worldwide.Fremont, co-senior author Michael Diamond, MD, PhD, and colleagues identified 6 antibodies that bound strongly to Zika virus and used a technique called X-ray crystallography to zero in on the binding site. They locked the virus and the antibodies into place together -- or crystallized them -- and visualized the adjacent structures by bouncing X-rays off them. The 2 most protective antibodies bound to the same region of the viral envelope protein that covers the surface of the virus.""We think that this piece of the viral envelope protein alone would be able to elicit a protective immune response to Zika,"" Fremont said, referring to the possibility of making a vaccine from an engineered viral protein rather than the whole virus.Despite having recently developed a mouse model of Zika infection during pregnancy, the researchers have not yet tested whether vaccinating mothers with a portion of the Zika envelope protein could protect a fetus from infection. ""The mouse is just not an ideal model for those kind of experiments,"" said Diamond, the Herbert S Gasser Professor of Medicine. In pregnant women, maternal antibodies are transported efficiently across the placenta to protect the fetus. The same is not true in mice, which obtain their mothers' antibodies mostly after birth. Diamond said that studies to determine whether vaccinating pregnant women against Zika could protect their fetuses likely would need to be done in primates.The study's findings are in agreement with a paper published 14 Jul [2016] in Science that identified the same general section of the viral envelope protein as a key site for antibody binding. However, the previous paper lacked the detailed description of how the antibodies interact with the virus, information that could aid in designing a Zika vaccine.The antibodies described in this study, which reliably distinguished Zika from closely related viruses, also could be incorporated into a diagnostic test. Zika currently is diagnosed primarily by detecting the viral genome, which requires high levels of the virus in the blood and only identifies people who have been infected within a week of being tested. A complementary test would measure the amount of Zika-specific antibodies in people's blood, which could identify people infected months or years prior. Developing such a test has been hampered by a lack of Zika-specific tools.""You really want to know not just how many people have virus in their blood right now but also how many people have been infected over time,"" Diamond said. Added Fremont, ""This is particularly important for pregnant women who want to know whether they were infected with Zika earlier in their pregnancy. The current tests won't tell us that.""The antibodies -- which protected mice from a lethal dose of Zika in this study -- also potentially could be used to treat high-risk patients, such as people with other medical conditions and pregnant women. ""Cost would be an issue, if we're going to treat a woman for the duration of her pregnancy,"" Diamond said. ""But in theory, an antibody prophylaxis could protect against infection of the fetus."" Since the antibodies in this study were obtained from mice, they would need to be modified to be more like human antibodies, before they could be used in people.The researchers also found a particularly worrisome pattern: low levels of anti-Zika antibodies -- too low to protect against disease -- helped the related dengue virus infect cells in a petri dish. People with dengue virus tend to get sicker the 2nd time they are infected, because low levels of antibodies left over from the 1st infection help the virus invade. Dengue and Zika are both circulating in tropical parts of the Americas, including Brazil. It is possible that people who get infected with dengue after Zika -- or after immunization with a Zika vaccine -- would develop more severe dengue disease.""One has to be careful extrapolating from experiments with cells in a lab to what happens to real people,"" Diamond said. ""Will Zika immunity really exacerbate dengue virus pathogenesis? All we know now is that it's possible in the laboratory.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Reference-----------Zhao H, Fernandez E, Dowd KA, Speer SD, Platt DJ, Gorman MJ, Govero J, Nelson CA, Pierson TC, Diamond MS, Fremont DH: Structural basis of Zika virus specific antibody protection.

Researchers are now racing to develop a Zika vaccine and trying to tease out how and if ADE influences severe cases of Zika virus and if cross-infection with dengue or other flavivirus enhance the disease.""Flavivirus is a master at enhancing the immune response; that's why you have ADE,"" said Scott Michael, PhD. ""It's a game between hosts and virus that's gone on forever.""Michael is professor of biology at Florida Gulf Coast University, where he investigates dengue, Zika, and other flaviviruses. He said there's been a wave of literature published in the last year showing cross-enhancements of disease within the flavivirus family. He co-authored a paper, in BioRxiv in April [2016] that showed the possibly dangerous interaction between Zika and dengue.""Our results suggest that pre-existing DENV immunity will enhance ZIKV infection in vivo and may increase disease severity,"" the authors write. ""If ZIKV ADE is fundamentally similar to DENV ADE, it is highly likely that preexisting anti-DENV antibodies will increase ZIKV viremia in humans and lead to more severe disease in vivo.""The authors suggest that this means Zika may transmit more quickly and be more infectious in areas where dengue is endemic.Michael said rushing to make a Zika vaccine without fully understanding how ADE works could lead to dire consequences. ""We desperately need vaccines against both dengue and Zika, and I hope that enthusiasm to get something into use quickly doesn't neglect safety,"" he said.Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he's aware of 6 Zika vaccines in development, and said ADE is always considered when working with flavivirus. ""We haven't seen ADE in vaccines,"" said Fauci. ""I'm not playing it down, I'm aware of it. But I don't think ADE will be a prohibitive problem in Zika vaccines.""But Philip K Russell, MD, PhD, the former director of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and commander of the US Army Medical Research and Development Command, as well as founding president and chairman of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, said that the fact that Zika is occurring in areas where dengue has been endemic hints at a serious potential problem with ADE and Zika vaccine development.""The current epidemic of Zika, which is usually mild disease, is made a lot worse in these populations,"" Russell said. ""I think there's a major effect, but the studies haven't been done yet to sort that out.""Vincent Racaniello, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University in New York City said the research on Zika and dengue enhancement puts Dengvaxia in an even harsher light, ""Given the recent observation that antibodies to dengue virus enhance Zika virus infection, one must also wonder if immunization with CYD [Dengvaxia] can lead to worse Zika virus disease,"" he said. ""It's clear that CYD is not the dengue vaccine that the world needs.""For Halstead, concerns about Zika and ADE are interesting but are so far only projections.[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Given that there are more than a million dengue cases annually in Brazil, many individuals who are immune to one or more dengue viruses must be experiencing Zika virus infections. Whether ADE has been occurring in these individuals, with resulting more severe Zika virus disease, has not been determined. One cannot help but wonder if ADE is a mechanism that helps Zika virus infect and cross the placenta and is contributory to infection of the fetus with resulting teratogenic effects, but at this point in time that is pure speculation. - Mod.TY]******[5] Neural stem cell tropismDate: Fri 15 Jul 2016Source: EBioMedicine journal [edited]<http://www.ebiomedicine.com/article/S2352-3964(16)30323-1/fulltext>Ref: Brault J-B, Khou C, Basset J, et al: Comparative analysis between flaviviruses reveals specific neural stem cell tropism for Zika virus in the mouse developing neocortex.

We describe here an assay to infect cultured mouse embryonic brain slices with Zika virus as well as other closely related flaviviruses not demonstrated to cause microcephaly. We show that Zika virus displays a specific pattern of infection in the developing brain, almost exclusively infecting neural stem cells. Zika virus impairs neural stem cell proliferation, an effect not seen for other flaviviruses and that may participate in the induction of microcephaly.Abstract--------The recent Zika outbreak in South America and French Polynesia was associated with an epidemic of microcephaly, a disease characterized by a reduced size of the cerebral cortex. Other members of the _Flavivirus_ genus, including West Nile virus (WNV), can cause encephalitis but were not demonstrated to cause microcephaly. It remains unclear whether Zika virus (ZIKV) and other flaviviruses may infect different cell populations in the developing neocortex and lead to distinct developmental defects. Here, we describe an assay to infect mouse E15 embryonic brain slices with ZIKV, WNV, and dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4). We show that this tissue is able to support viral replication of ZIKV and WNV, but not DENV-4. Cell fate analysis reveals a remarkable tropism of ZIKV infection for neural stem cells. Closely related WNV displays a very different tropism of infection, with a bias towards neurons. We further show that ZIKV infection, but not WNV infection, impairs cell cycle progression of neural stem cells. Both viruses inhibited apoptosis at early stages of infection. This work establishes a powerful comparative approach to identify ZIKV-specific alterations in the developing neocortex and reveals specific preferential infection of neural stem cells by ZIKV.--Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[It would be interesting to know if ZIKV has the same tropism for neural stem cells in humans.

[Note: this article has not been peer reviewed]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Background: The southern United States (US) may be vulnerable to outbreaks of Zika Virus (ZIKV), given the broad distribution of ZIKV vector species and periodic ZIKV introductions by travelers returning from affected regions. If autochthonous (locally-acquired) cases appear within the US, policymakers will seek early and accurate indicators of self-sustaining transmission to inform intervention efforts. However, given ZIKV's low reporting rates and the geographic variability in both importations and transmission potential, a small cluster of reported cases may reflect diverse scenarios, ranging from multiple self-limiting but independent introductions to a self-sustaining local epidemic.Methods and findings: We developed a stochastic model that captures variation and uncertainty in ZIKV case reporting, importations, and transmission, and applied it to assess county-level risk throughout the state of Texas. For each of the 254 counties, we estimated the future epidemic risk as a function of reported autochthonous cases and evaluated a national recommendation to trigger interventions immediately following the 1st 2 reported cases of locally-transmitted ZIKV. Our analysis suggests that the regions of greatest risk for sustained ZIKV transmission include 21 Texas counties along the Texas-Mexico border, in the Houston Metro Area, and throughout the I-35 Corridor from San Antonio to Waco. Variation in vector habitat suitability drives epidemic risk variation, and can be exacerbated by uncertainty in reporting rate. Upon detection of a 2nd locally transmitted case, the threat of epidemic expansion will depend critically on local vulnerability. For high risk Texas counties, we estimate this likelihood to be 64 percent, assuming an August 2016 risk projection and a 20 percent reporting rate.Conclusions: With reliable estimates of key epidemiological parameters, including reporting rates and vector abundance, this framework can help optimize the timing and spatial allocation of public health resources to fight ZIKV in the US.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The authors propose a similar risk evaluation approach would be of value to other states in which the vector mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_) occurs, to be able to focus interventions on those areas most likely to have cases. It will be important to test the assumptions on which this model is based when the opportunity arises to test it in the field as cases occur. - Mod.TY]
