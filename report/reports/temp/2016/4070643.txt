Since the beginning of the year (1 Jan 2016) there have been a total of 34 newly confirmed cases reported in Saudi Arabia, including 7 cases reported in the past 3 days. Noteworthy is that 5 of the 7 cases reported since the beginning of March 2016 have been reported from Buraidah.The locations of the newly reported cases can be found in a map at the source URL.

They reported MERS-CoV antibodies in people who tended livestock, despite the participants reporting low levels of contact with camels, a known reservoir for the virus.The team analyzed blood samples from 1122 livestock herders that were collected as part of a household study in 2013 and 2014 in 2 counties.Of those for whom information about sex and age was known, 603 were female and 407 were male, with a median age of 27 years (range 5 to 90). The 3 most-reported occupations were pastoralist (20.6 percent), farmer (17.0 percent), and student (11.4 percent). The households of nearly all study participants kept livestock, mainly goats, sheep, cattle, and donkeys. Although care of camels was not common among the participants, camels are widespread in this region, the authors noted.Two serum samples tested positive via plaque-reduction neutralization testing for MERS-CoV antibodies. One sample was from a 26-year-old woman, and one was from a 58-year-old man, both from Tana River County. The woman tended goats, sheep, cattle, and donkeys, and the man kept goats and donkeys.Antibody titers were low in both people, and neither of them reported recent clinical symptoms, ""indicating that their MERS-CoV infections probably occurred well before the time of sampling and that the infections may have been mild or subclinical,"" the scientists reported.""Because data about persistence of MERS-CoV antibodies after asymptomatic infection are not available, it can only be speculated when and where these infections were acquired,"" they added. ""Neither the 2 MERS-CoV antibody-positive persons nor most of the other tested persons owned dromedaries. Nevertheless, camels roam in both counties, and humans have regular contact with camels and are likely to consume camel products.""They also noted that infection via other domestic animals cannot be ruled out. They do not mention whether the 2 patients had traveled to a MERS-endemic region.The authors concluded, ""For increased understanding of any possible differences in pathogenicity and transmission potential, these MERS-CoV strains should be compared with isolates from the Middle East.""[Byline: Jim Wappes]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The original article discussed above is: Liljander A, Meyer B, Jores J, Muller MA, Lattwein E, Njeru I, et al. MERS-CoV antibodies in humans, Africa, 2013-2014. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016 May [date cited]. <http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2206.160064>. The authors concluded: ""Our study provides evidence for unrecorded human MERS-CoV infections in Kenya. The proportion of seropositive specimens that we found is comparable to previously reported proportions of unrecorded infections in the general population in Saudi Arabia (1.52 percent vs. 1.43 percent positivity by rELISA and 0.15 percent vs. 0.18 percent positivity by PRNT [plaque-reduction neutralization test] for Kenya vs. Saudi Arabia, respectively)."" (The comparable data from Saudi Arabia comes from MÃŒ ller MA, Meyer B, Corman VM, Al-Masri M, Turkestani A, Ritz D, Presence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus antibodies in Saudi Arabia: a nationwide, cross-sectional, serological study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2015;15:559-64. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(15)70090-3>.)This observation is very intriguing as it demonstrates that there have been cases of MERS-CoV infection in humans in Kenya. The authors suggest that ""The lack of a well-developed public health system in parts of Africa could lead to underdiagnosis of clinical cases and would therefore prevent case notification. Moreover, less accessible hospital care might preclude large nosocomial outbreaks as have been observed in countries on the Arabian Peninsula and in South Korea.""
