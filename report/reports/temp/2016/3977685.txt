These cases occurred in Viana municipality, a suburb of the capital, Luanda, which was reported on 26 Jan 2016. The current YF cases are in the municipality of Caluquembe, located in southern Huila province and nearly 1000 km [620 miles] from the Luanda outbreak. This raises the question if these are independent outbreaks, or if the Huila outbreak was initiated by a viremic individual traveling from Viana to Caluquembeas as the governor suspects. The Angola outbreak is a month old now. Vigorous action including vaccination and vector control are necessary to bring the outbreak in these 2 localities under control before they spread further. In YF outbreaks, time and inaction are the enemies.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32978>; of Viana in relation to Luanda at <http://becoangola.com/imagens/viana.gif>; and a map showing the provinces of Angola at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/angola/angola-political-map.html>. - Mod.TY]
