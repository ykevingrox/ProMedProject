Mail Online, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3654715/Puerto-Rico-public-hospital-faces-Hepatitis-A-outbreak.html>Puerto Rico's largest public hospital is reporting an outbreak of hepatitis A. The director of the island's Medical Services Administration says at least 26 cases have been reported among employees at the Centro Medico in Rio Piedras. Irving Jimenez said [Wed 22 Jun 2016], that it appears the employees all had bought food from an unlicensed street vendor.Officials say that no patients so far have been infected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Epidemiologically, although the outbreak was in health care workers, it seems that this is not nosocomial but rather foodborne from an outside food vendor.As noted by Mod.JW, the yellow fever (YF) epidemic in Angola was initially diagnosed as food poisoning, and in the current climate of uncertainty about yellow fever, it would be a good idea to exclude it from the differential diagnosis of all cases of severe hepatitis in the correct setting. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53858>.]
