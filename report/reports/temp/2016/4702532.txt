Healio, Infectious Disease News [edited]<http://tinyurl.com/hxxv7b5>Recent data from a population-based, observational study in China revealed that patients were more likely to develop multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from person-to-person transmission than from inadequate treatment [1].""Inadequate treatment was considered to be the most common way of developing MDR [tuberculosis (TB)]; however, our data show that most of the patients in our study population who had [MDR-TB] had been infected with MDR strains,"" Chongguang Yang, PhD, postdoctoral associate of epidemiology of microbial diseases at Yale School of Medicine, and colleagues wrote in the Lancet Infectious Diseases. ""We also found that a majority of transmission events occurred in settings such as residential communities or complexes and related public facilities.""Yang and colleagues performed variable-number-of-tandem-repeat (VNTR) genotyping and whole-genome sequencing on MDR-TB isolates collected from patients in Shanghai, China to establish transmission patterns and risk factors of MDR-TB in the area. Their analysis included data from 324 patients aged 15 years and older who were diagnosed with MDR-TB between [1 Jan 2009 and 31 Dec 2012]. The researchers used a standardized questionnaire to determine patients' social characteristics, history of TB exposure, and locations where transmission may have occurred.According to the data, 59 percent of patients with MDR-TB were treatment-naive. Overall, 32 percent of the 324 MDR-TB strains were in 38 genomic clusters that differed by 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms or fewer, indicating recent transmission. The researchers combined treatment-naive cases (n = 191) with cases included in genomic clusters (n = 93) and estimated that up to 73 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval], 67.3-77.3) of all MDR-TB cases were likely caused by transmission of MDR strains.Epidemiological links were identified in 69 percent of the genomically clustered cases, only 4 of which were traced to household contacts. The majority (n = 45) of cases were either linked to other cases from the same residential community or neighborhood street, or cases using the same public health facilities such as food markets. Additional analyses of epidemiological data revealed that a delayed diagnosis of at least 2 months (OR = 2.02; 95 percent CI, 1.08-3.81), and being aged 45 to 64 years (OR = 1.9; 95 percent CI, 1.04-3.46) and 65 years or older (OR = 2.94; 95 percent CI, 1.28-6.79) were independently associated with genomic clustering.For further investigation, Yang and colleagues mapped mutations associated with drug resistance in MDR-TB strains onto putative transmission networks. They found that 87 percent of clusters accumulated additional drug resistance mutations during transmission.""Inadequate therapies could accelerate selection of new mutations and increase drug resistance, and these drug-resistant strains could be transmitted to others,"" the researchers wrote. ""Unfortunately, inadequate treatment of [MDR-TB] is a problem in China, particularly in hospitals. Therefore, treating patients with [MDR-TB] on the basis of results of drug susceptibility testing should become a mandatory policy.""In their analysis, Yang and colleagues noted that 66 percent (95 percent CI, 56-75) of MDR strains in the genomic clusters had compensatory mutations of rifampicin resistance. This is much higher than the proportion of compensatory mutations reported globally (20 percent) and in high-burden areas (31 percent), they wrote.""To our knowledge, we describe the 1st population-based study combining genomics with detailed epidemiological data to identify transmission pathways of [MDR-TB] in a region over time in China, the country with the second highest number of [MDR-TB] cases in the world,"" the researchers wrote. ""Our findings suggest that strategies and interventions to halt ongoing transmission of MDR strains should be a priority for [TB] control programs in China and other settings with a high burden of [MDR-TB].""In a related editorial, Ben J Marais, PhD, and Vitali Sintchenko, PhD, of the University of Sydney [Australia], said that the spread of MDR-TB in China has implications for non-endemic regions, where most TB cases occur among immigrants, migrant workers and international students despite pre-entry disease screening [2].""Without adequate strategies to contain the spread of [MDR-TB], the possibility of epidemic replacement (predominance of drug-resistant strains over drug-susceptible strains) should be recognized as a major threat,"" they wrote. ""The data ... offer an important example of how advances in whole-genome sequencing provide a better understanding of [MDR-TB] transmission dynamics, which will be essential to guide better targeted public health responses and contain its epidemic spread.""[Byline: Stephanie Viguers][References-----------1.

Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a subset of MDR-TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to fluoroquinolones and at least one of the 3 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).MDR-TB may be primary or secondary. Secondary MDR-TB is acquired as a consequence of the emergence of drug-resistant mutants during inadequate or improper use of anti-TB medications for active TB. Primary MDR-TB is a new infection (in the absence of a history of prior treatment with anti-TB drugs) that has been acquired from someone with MDR-TB.Primary drug resistance indicates need for better TB control to interrupt transmission, whereas secondary drug resistance indicates need for better patient management to prevent the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.Transmission usually requires close, repeated or prolonged contact with a contagious individual in a poorly ventilated environment that occurs in household or institutions, such as homeless shelters. However, in the study from China the majority of cases were either linked to other cases from the same residential community or neighborhood street, or cases using the same public facilities such as food markets. This situation in China is similar to an outbreak of MDR-TB in Singapore (see also's below) where most cases with matching genotypes did not have anything in common, other than living in the same neighborhood. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/361>.]
