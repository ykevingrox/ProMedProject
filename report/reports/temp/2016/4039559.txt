The Nation [edited]<http://thenationonlineng.net/lassa-fever-death-toll-hits-58/>A total of 58 persons have been confirmed dead [in the] Lassa fever disease outbreak in Nigeria. This was out of 83 diagnosed cases in the country.Minister of State for Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire gave this figure when he paid a working visit to the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital to inspect Lassa fever facilities at the hospital.Ehanire said the federal government was working hard to stop the yearly outbreak of Lassa fever in the country. He assured that the disease was gradually being defeated.According to the Minister: ""We have been trying to curtail Lassa fever, which is going down now, and Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital is among the centres of excellence. I came to see the status and how well they are coping. ""This hospital is one of the centres with special facilities and I came to see how well they are coping. I have seen the equipment and the challenges and we are looking at ways to make sure Lassa fever does not become a yearly problem.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report raises several questions. It does not indicate either when or where the cases occurred. The last Nigeria-wide ProMED-mail post of 12 Feb 2016 (archive no.20160212.4017250) indicates that there were 176 suspected cases with 108 deaths and 78 confirmed cases with 49 deaths. This report indicates 83 cases with 58 confirmed deaths. Presumably, the 83 cases are also confirmed, in which case there is an increase of 5 confirmed cases and 9 additional confirmed deaths. This report does not indicate how the government intends to stop the outbreak. Significantly reducing the populations of the rodent host will not be easy. If the equipment in the hospital includes that needed for barrier nursing and paitient isolation, that will help reduce the numbers of cases and fatalities. The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety. Unfortunately, nosocomial transmission is not unusual. Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. There has been no indication that a village-level control effort has been initiated yet.
