The Hamilton Spectator [edited]<http://www.thespec.com/news-story/6222323-bubonic-plague-outbreak-kills-63-in-madagascar/>The latest outbreak of bubonic plague on the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar has killed 63 people since August 2015, the Health Ministry said. At least 174 cases of the disease have been detected, Maherisoa Ratsitorahina, head of disease surveillance at the ministry, said in a statement Thursday [7 Jan 2016] in the capital, Antananarivo. Madagascar notified the WHO of the current outbreak in September 2015.At least 79 people died after an outbreak in 2014 that continued into early 2015, when at least 335 cases were reported, according to the WHO. The bacterial disease is spread to people who have been bitten by infected rodent fleas, the WHO says.Efforts to curb the spread of the disease are being impeded by a build-up of garbage in Antananarivo amid a dispute between the municipality and the national government over who is responsible for waste management in the city.[Byline: Fanja Razafimahatratra]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.The following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm>).""Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.""Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the ""black plague"" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-81; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004>). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181>.]
