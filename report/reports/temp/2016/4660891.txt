This brings the total number of newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Nov 2016 up to 20. One of the newly reported cases since 1 Nov 2016 was classified as a secondary case in a household contact, while the other 19 cases were classified as primary cases with 7 having a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness and the remaining 12 were still under investigation for possible high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of their illness.Of note is that these 20 cases were reported from different locations in the country: Afeef (Afif - 1 case), Alaflaj (1 case), Alkharj (2 cases), Alzulfi (1 case), Arar (1 case), Bahrah (1 case), Buqayq (1 case), Buraidah (2 cases), Hafr-Elbatin (2 cases), Najran (2 cases), Rejal Alma' (1 case), Riyadh (2 cases), Tabuk (1 case), Taif (1 case), and Yanbua (1 case).So the question remains, is there a not-so-silent outbreak ongoing in the country? Or is this just an increased awareness to test for the disease coinciding with a season increase in transmission?A map showing the locations of the recently reported cases in the report above can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPP]******[2] WHO update - 28 Nov 2016Date: Mon 28 Nov 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/28-november-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia 28 Nov 2016----------------------------------------------------------------Between 3 and 10 Nov 2016 the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 6 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 2 deaths among previously reported MERS cases were also reported.Details of the cases1 - a 68 year old male national living in Alkharj city, Riyadh Region.
