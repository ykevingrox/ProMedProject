La Discusion [edited, in Spanish, trans. Corr. SB and Sr. Tech Ed. MJ, edited]<http://www.ladiscusion.cl/detalle/3692/Trabajador-de-Quill%C3%B3n-se-encuentra-grave-por-contagio-de-virus-Hanta> The Health SEREMI [regional ministerial unit] authorities in Bio Bio have confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the region, becoming the 8th during the current season. He is male, aged 45, resident in the Quillan community.At present, the affected person has been admitted to the Herminda Martin hospital in Chillan [BiÌâå o Bio], assessed in serious, but stable condition. According to preliminary investigations, this person works occupationally at industrial cleaning tasks in a sawmill in Nueva Aldea and recently performed tasks during the night shift. Personnel of the Epidemiology, Zoonosis and Occupational Health, of the ÌÄ'uble province Health SEREMI, continue field investigations in order to establish the possible place of infection.During 2016, 33 cases have been confirmed with an incidence rate of 0.18 per 100 000 inhabitants, with a 21.2 percent fatality rate (7 deaths). The distribution of cases by sex is 57.6 percent for males and 42.4 percent for women. During the same period in 2015, 36 confirmed cases, with 15 deaths (41.7 percent case fatality) were recorded.To date, there have been 8 cases of hantavirus infection in [BiÌâå o Bio] region, with an incidence rate of 0.38 per 100 000 inhabitants. The case fatality rate during that period is 12.5 percent (1 case). The cases are concentrated in the provinces of Nuble (5 cases) with 62 percent and BiÌâå o Bio (3 cases) with 38 percent. The average age is 38 years with a range of 13-69 years. Risk activity that is recorded is being a resident of the rural sector.Hantavirus is endemic in Chile occurring seasonally, with the highest incidence in the southern regions of the country. The season of greatest risk for hantavirus infection is between spring and summer, considering the season as running from September of one year through August of the following year. The virus is transmitted to humans from the wild rodent _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_ (long-tailed pygmy rice rat, autochthonous). The most common transmission occurs through the inhalation of aerosols produced from infected rodent urine [saliva and feces].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Andes hantavirus is endemic in Chile and cases of infection are reported every year in the BÌ o BÌ o region. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus infection, some with pulmonary syndrome, occur every year. Infections are acquired when people are exposed to virus-containing excreta from infected rodents. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/chilfung/chile_regions.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/30964>. - Mod.TY]
