Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/taiwan-salmonella-outbreak-dengue-fever-and-the-1st-enterovirus-death-75879/>Enterovirus infection has killed a 2 year old girl, being the 1st death this year. The case had incomplete brain development and a medical history of right-sided hemiparesis and development delay. Since the end of August [2016], the case subsequently developed symptoms, including upper respiratory tract infection and middle ear infection in both ears. In the night of 6 Sep [2016], she developed high fever and blisters on the soft palate. After seeking medical attention, she was diagnosed with herpangina. On 9 Sep [2016], when she developed spasm, unconsciousness, and foaming at the mouth, she was hospitalized for treatment in the intensive care unit. Infection with EV 71 was laboratory confirmed in the case after the hospital reported the case to the health authority. However, the case's conditions did not improve and she remained in shock, experiencing low body temperature, low blood pressure and multiple organ dysfunction. Unfortunately, on 12 Sep [2016], she died of heart and lung failure and sepsis.According to the surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, enterovirus activity in Taiwan has recently increased and coxsackie A virus is currently the dominant strain circulating in the community. As of 20 Sep [2016], a total of 21 severe cases of enterovirus infection have been confirmed, including 20 caused by EV 71 and 1 caused by CA 5.Health officials remind the public that enteroviruses remain highly contagious, especially in crowded places such as households and child care facilities. Therefore, childcare center personnel and parents are advised to pay attention to their health and the health of infants and children they care for.When a child in a household is diagnosed with enterovirus infection, parents and child caregivers are urged to refrain the sick child from close contact with other children to prevent further spread of the disease and watch for the development of prodromal symptoms of severe enterovirus infection in the sick child such as drowsiness, disturbed consciousness, inactivity, flaccid paralysis, myoclonic jerk, continuous vomiting, tachypnea, and tachycardia to ensure timely treatment.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Since the initial description of enterovirus 71 (EV71) in 1974 [1], outbreaks of infection with this virus have occurred periodically throughout the world [2-8]. EV71 infection manifests most frequently as the childhood exanthem known as ""hand, foot, and mouth disease"" (HFMD) (...).EV71 has a propensity to cause neurological disease during acute infection [2, 3]. Children less than 4 years of age are particularly susceptible to the most severe forms of EV71-associated neurological disease, including meningitis, brain-stem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. The neurological complications of EV71 infection may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death. Several large epidemics of severe EV71 infection in young children, including numerous cases of fatal brain-stem encephalitis, have recently been reported in Southeast Asia [10-12].There is significant variation in the spectrum of neurological disease associated with EV71 epidemics. Certain outbreaks have been associated with a predominance of aseptic meningitis (97 percent) [8], a high frequency of poliomyelitis-like paralysis (21 percent) [4, 5, 13], and, more recently, fatal brain-stem encephalitis [12, 14, 15].For full publication and references see P.McMinn et al., Neurological Manifestations of Enterovirus 71 Infection in Children during an Outbreak of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Western Australia.

A total of 19 EV-D68 positive cases were detected from 163 rhinovirus/enterovirus positive specimens (11.7 percent). Of the 18 paediatric cases, 16 cases were found in children under the age of 7. EV-D68 was detected in 1 child with recurrent hospitalizations for an unrelated illness; 5 children were found to have mild respiratory illness and had been evaluated in outpatient clinics or the emergency department; 10 required hospitalization for up to 5 days and exhibited signs of mild to moderate respiratory illness; 1 child was found to have gastroenteritis, and a final case was detected at autopsy in a 1-month old child. No evidence of pneumonia was identified at autopsy, and EV-D68 was likely an incidental finding. EV-D68 was also detected in 1 adult over the age of 60 who was chronically ventilated. There have been no reports of acute flaccid paralysis among these cases, but one child was diagnosed with culture-negative meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid testing for enterovirus by PCR was negative for this case.In hospital B, a total of 4 EV-D68 cases were reported among 51 (7.8 percent) enterovirus positive specimens detected from 1 to 31 Aug 2016. All 4 cases were children under the age of 16 years of age (range 1 - 15) and all had pre-existing co-morbidities. Of these 4, 2 required hospitalization as a result of respiratory symptoms that exacerbated their pre-existing conditions. None were reported as having exhibited neurologic symptoms.None of the cases have been reported as being epidemiologically linked.Enteroviruses are a group of RNA viruses that can cause various clinical syndromes including: asymptomatic illness; mild respiratory illness; hand-foot-and mouth syndrome; and neurologic symptoms. Infections with enteroviruses are very common, especially in the summer and autumn months. There are over 100 serotypes of enteroviruses.EV-D68 is a specific serotype of enterovirus that was noted to be associated with severe respiratory illness in children, especially those with a history of asthma, in the summer of 2014, though it has been circulating for many years. Children and teenagers appear to be at increased risk of infection from EV-D68, although the virus can infect adults as well.Enteroviruses typically spread by the fecal-oral route; however, EV-D68 appears to spread via droplet and direct contact like other respiratory viruses. Patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should be placed on ""droplet and contact precautions"". Environmental disinfection of surfaces in healthcare settings should be performed using a hospital-grade disinfectant with a label claim of effectiveness against non-enveloped viruses.A summary of clinical features and laboratory testing results in Ontario for EV-D68 in 2014 and 2015 can be found in the following publications:Mertz D, Alawfi A, Pernica JM et al.
