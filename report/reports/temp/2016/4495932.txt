""However, CDC has provided guidelines for use of a 3rd dose as a control measure during mumps outbreaks in settings in which persons are in close contact with one another, where transmission is sustained despite high 2-dose MMR coverage, and when traditional control measures fail to slow transmission.""The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) confirmed an outbreak of mumps at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (C-UPHD) on 1 May 2015. Between April 2015 and May 2016, researchers identified 317 cases on campus. The university, IDPH and the university's McKinley Health Center recommended a 3rd MMR vaccination due to the seasonal trends and characteristics of the population at risk.About 50 000 students and staff members were targeted for 3rd-dose vaccination on C-UPHD campus. A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.Epidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.""In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,"" they wrote.Reference:Albertson JP, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm62529a2.[byline: Kate Sherrer] --communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[While a 3rd dose of the vaccine sounds like it might be helpful in boosting immunity, it must be given sufficiently prior to exposure for the immunity to be boosted to be protective. As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.A 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(<http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf>). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]******[3] USA (Oklahoma)Date: Thu 15 Sep 2016Source: Enid News & Eagle [edited]<http://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html>Update: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated--------------------------------------------------------Garfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.""I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,"" Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle. She added that this particular vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella -- ""is 88 per cent effective -- but not perfect. Individuals with 2 doses can still get mumps.""Enid Public Schools [EPS] sent out a text message Wednesday [14 Sep 2016] evening reporting that Garfield County Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of mumps in the community, including at Longfellow Middle School and Enid High School.Oklahoma Health Department later reported there have been 4 confirmed cases in Garfield County and at least 34 suspected cases.EPS requires students to be in compliance with Oklahoma vaccination laws, EPS Communications Director Amber Graham Fitzgerald said. ""Prior to (Wednesday's) events, the EPS Health Services Department established (Thursday) as the deadline for compliance,"" she said. ""Those not in compliance -- there are about 12 students who don't have the MMR vaccine -- will not be allowed to return to school until they are in compliance."" This does not include students who have a religious or physical exemption from vaccinations, she said.Laurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist with the Acute Disease Service for the Oklahoma State Department of Health, confirmed that some of those who are suspected of contracting the disease in Enid have been vaccinated and that others have not been or do not know if they have been vaccinated. ""That's what you might expect in an outbreak situation,"" Burnsed said. ""If you have the recommended 2 doses of MMR, you're at an 88 per cent level of protection, so if 100 people were exposed, you would still have about 12 experiencing symptoms. The vaccine is not 100 per cent protective."" In the health department's collaboration with school officials, Burnsed said there seems to be a good level of vaccinations.The MMR vaccine is available at Garfield County Health Department.Mumps is a virus spread though coughing, sneezing and direct contact with saliva through eating or drinking after an infected person, according to Garfield County Health Department. Symptoms can last 7-10 days and usually appear 12-25 days after infection.Mumps is characterized by puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw, due to swollen salivary glands. Other symptoms include body aches, tiredness and fever, and males may experience swollen, painful testicles, according to the department. In order to prevent spreading mumps, children who exhibit such symptoms should not attend school or day care through 5 days after the illness begins, according to the department.Burnsed encouraged those who have not been vaccinated or who are behind on their vaccination schedule to get the MMR vaccine to help protect against the illness. Burnsed also said the state department is not ruling out that Enid's suspected outbreak could be related to a similar outbreak in Arkansas. ""It's certainly possible, considering the proximity,"" Burnsed said. ""But we are still gathering information.""On Monday [12 Sep 2016], the Arkansas Department of Health reported almost 100 cases of mumps have been confirmed in the state, with most being in Springdale, but some reported in Rogers and potential cases in Fayetteville, Huntsville and West Fork, according to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.[byline: Sally Asher]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The cases in Oklahoma had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, but still came down with measles. This suggests 3 doses may be more protective. - Mod.LK]******[4] USA (New York)Date: Thu 15 Sep 2016Source: New York Upstate [edited]<http://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/2016/09/ny_warns_state_colleges_about_mumps_outbreak.html>New York warns state colleges about mumps outbreak--------------------------------------------------A mumps case at SUNY [State University of New York] Oswego may be linked to an outbreak of the contagious viral infection in the Long Beach area of Long Island [New York]. The State Health Department is warning colleges throughout the state the Long Beach outbreak could lead to other cases. The State Health Department said public health officials on Long Island have identified 45 mumps cases related to the Long Beach outbreak since July [2016].A SUNY Plattsburgh student also was recently diagnosed with mumps, but the source of that infection is still under investigation.Both schools have notified unvaccinated students they will be barred from campus for 26 days after the last possible exposure if they do not get vaccinated. The health department said this step is being taken to avoid a large outbreak.Mumps is characterized by fever, headache, swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches and loss of appetite. After a person is exposed to mumps, symptoms usually appear 16 to 18 days after infection. Mumps cannot be treated.Two doses of the mumps vaccine provides the best protection against the disease, according to the health department.The department offered these tips to prevent the spread of mumps:- do not share food, drinks, utensils or other personal items that may contain saliva;- wash hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub;- cover your mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and discard the tissue;- clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.People with mumps should stay home away from public places for 5 days after the onset of symptoms and limit contact with others in their households.Mumps is no longer common in the United States. As of 13 Aug [2016], 1786 cases nationwide had been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [in 2016].[byline: James T Mulder]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Mumps may no longer be common in the US, but this year (2016) there appear to be a spate of cases throughout the country to the extent that CDC is considering a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine in certain situations.A map of the US showing all states discussed can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>. - Mod.LK]
