This is the 2nd in a community like Cunco.""""We hope that the development of this patient, who today [4 Aug 2016] is in the hospital in ChillÌÁn for reasons of biosecurity, because there they have beds for adequate management, will go well,"" he added.Epidemiological teams are currently carrying out investigations in order to determine where the woman could have been infected and thus avoid new infections.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Active transmission of hantaviruses in the AraucanÌ a region continues into the cool season. Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, it doubtless is Andes virus. Much of central and southern Chile, including the AraucanÌ a region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus.The report above provides little information about the circumstances under which the woman acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/17375>. - Mod.TY]
