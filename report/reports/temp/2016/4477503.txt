Most disinfectants used in daycares would not have label claim against poliovirus or norovirus (other small non-enveloped viruses). As the main mode of transmission of this organism is fecal-oral, and in day care we know how illnesses like norovirus can sweep through a facility, it might be prudent to ensure disinfectants used within these settings are effective against small, non-enveloped viruses within a realistic contact time. I have to remind myself that hepatitis A is not related to hepatitis B or hepatitis C, enveloped viruses which are much easier to kill with disinfectants.--Jim Gauthier, MLT, CICSenior Clinical Advisor, Infection Prevention<james.gauthier@sealedair.com>[ProMED thanks Jim Gauthier for his relevant comments. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.][See Also:Hepatitis A - USA (14): fruit smoothies, strawberries ex Egypt 20160909.4477372Hepatitis A - USA (13): fruit smoothies, strawberries ex Egypt 20160903.4461205Hepatitis A - USA (12): (HI) frozen scallops 20160903.4463425Hepatitis A - USA (11): (MI) raw sewage contact 20160827.4445808Hepatitis A - USA (10): (VA) fruit smoothies, imported strawberries 20160822.4431203Hepatitis A - USA (09): (HI) frozen scallops 20160817.4422480Hepatitis A - USA (08): (HI) 20160810.4405316Hepatitis A - USA (07): (HI) 20160729.4376124Hepatitis A - USA (06): (HI) 20160721.4360060Hepatitis A - USA (05): (HI) 20160713.4342961Hepatitis A - USA (04): (HI) RFI 20160707.4330783Hepatitis A - USA (03): (HI) 20160703.4323888Hepatitis A - USA (02): (PR) hospital workers 20160630.4314683].................................................ll/je/dk"
