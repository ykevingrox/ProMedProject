New Mexico Department of Health [edited]<https://nmhealth.org/news/disease/2016/7/?view=443>The City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department, the New Mexico Department of Health, and the Bernalillo County Health Protection Section announced today [12 Jul 2016] that 2 cases of human tularemia have been confirmed from Bernalillo County, with one of the individuals likely being exposed in the bosque [In the predominantly arid or semi-arid southwestern United States, the bosque is an oasis-like ribbon of green vegetation, often canopied, that only exists near rivers, streams, or other water courses. It derives its name from the Spanish word for woodlands. - Mod.LL]. These are the 1st 2 laboratory confirmed human cases in New Mexico in 2016.The cases include a 74-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman. The woman is currently hospitalized but is improving, while the man has fully recovered. Health authorities are investigating both cases, with a special emphasis on the case that appears to have resulted from exposure in the bosque. It is believed that the illness was the result of a bite from an infected deer fly in the area.""Tularemia exposure in the Rio Grande bosque area appears to be a new development for us that we are taking seriously,"" said Dr Mark DiMenna, Deputy Director at the City's Environmental Health Department. ""We have historically warned Bernalillo County residents in the East Mountains and along the northern and eastern reaches of the city limits about tularemia risks, but this may represent a new area to be concerned about.""While the possibility of tularemia transmission in the bosque is a concern, City health officials urge appropriate precautions rather than avoiding use of the bosque. Avoiding sick or dead rodents and preventing deer fly bites are key measures to reduce risk. ""We would like to ask people who are using the bosque trails to report any dead or dying animals they see to us through 311,"" added Dr DiMenna. ""We will submit those animals for testing as we investigate the extent of tularemia in the area.""""Tularemia can cause serious illness in both people and pets. We urge New Mexicans to follow the same precautions they would to avoid contracting plague, which includes not handling sick or dead animals,"" said Department of Health Secretary Lynn Gallagher. ""People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals such as rabbits or rodents or if they are bitten by infected ticks or deer flies.""In 2014 there were 5 human cases of tularemia in New Mexico, and in 2015 there were 6 human cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Recognized vectors of _Francisella tularensis_ in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly). Many cases are acquired, without a vector, by direct or indirect exposure to infected animals including aerosols from lawn mowers and water from direct contamination. - Mod.LLThe state of New Mexico can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1843>.
