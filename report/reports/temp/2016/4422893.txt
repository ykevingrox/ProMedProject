FIC (Flu Information Centre/Flu in China), news.gov.hk report [edited]<http://www.flu.org.cn/en/news-18677.html>The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [12 Aug 2016] received notification of 5 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.According to the NHFPC, 2 patients in Fujian were a 79-year-old man who had visited a market and died on [10 Jul 2016], and a 78-year-old man who had poultry exposure and is currently in serious condition. A patient in Beijing is a 35-year-old male who had poultry exposure in Jiangxi and is currently in serious condition. 2 patients in Hebei are a 13-year-old girl and a 68-year-old woman, and both are in stable condition. They live together and the 13-year old patient had accompanied the above patient in Beijing back to Jiangxi.""H7N9 has become enzootic in poultry on the Mainland. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, from January 2015 to May 2016, poultry and environmental samples collected from markets in Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Shanghai and Zhejiang tested positive for H7N9. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations revealed that positive samples on the Mainland were mainly taken from live bird markets, vendors and some commercial or breeding farms,"" a spokesman for the CHP said. ""In view of additional human cases reported on the Mainland with detection of human cases in previously unaffected areas in warmer months, as well as the detection of positive samples of faecal droppings of live poultry in Hong Kong and the positive environmental sample in Macau in June [2016], the public should remain vigilant. Travellers to the Mainland and other avian influenza-affected areas in the summer vacation should not visit poultry markets, and should avoid contact with poultry and their droppings,"" the spokesman added.From 2013 to date, 775 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, while since October 2015 to date, 118 have been recorded.""We will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments,"" the spokesman said.The DH's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.The display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is under way. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:- do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;- if contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;- avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces, which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and- wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] WHODate: Wed 17 Aug 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-august-2016-ah7n9-china/en/>On 11 Aug 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China notified WHO of 5 additional cases of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including one death.Onset dates ranged from 24 Jun-29 Jul 2016, and 3 of the 5 cases are male. Cases ranged in age from 13-79 years with a median age of 68 years (among cases reported so far, age range is from 0-91 years, with a median age of 58 years).Of the 5 cases, 2 reported exposure to live poultry, or were involved in the slaughter of poultry. There was no reported history of exposure to poultry for the other 3 cases. Cases were reported from 2 provinces (Fujian and Hebei) and one municipality (Beijing). Cases reported from Hebei and Beijing were reported to be family members. Investigations are on-going, at this stage human-to human-transmission cannot be ruled out, however to date no further transmission has been reported.A total of 798 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.Public health response----------------------The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:- strengthening outbreak surveillance and situation analysis;- reinforcing all efforts on medical treatment; and- conducting risk communication with the public and dissemination of information.WHO risk assessment-------------------Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.WHO advice----------WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThere seems to be a discrepancy between the 2 reports with the CHP report mentioning a 3rd case had poultry exposure.  With respect to the possibility of person to person transmission in the case of the family members, it is also possible that there was a common exposure.  The presence of transmission in the ""slow transmission"" season (when the live poultry markets are open) is nevertheless of concern and one wonders if this will ultimately lead to permanent closure of the live poultry markets. - Mod.MPP]
