EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]Re: ProMED-mail post Pneumonia - Pakistan: (PB) children, RFI 20151214.3861544-------------The samples collected were negative for influenza A /H1N1 and also tested negative for MERS CoV as well. [The samples] will be processed for RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] now. Regarding the [hospital] admissions, multiple admissions on 1 bed/ incubator were observed in both tertiary care hospitals (Benazir Butto Hospital and Holy Family Hospitals). This shows the priority of government and scarcity/limitations of health facilities in Pakistan and especially in Punjab. This is routine practice to admit more than 1 child per bed, providing an opportunity for infection transmission.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Rawalpindi's large hospitals are seeing hundreds of patients daily with acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) with the onset of winter; 70-80 percent of the illnesses are upper RTIs, but nearly 20 to 30 percent are lower RTIs, including mild to severe pneumonia; 50 to 60 children with severe pneumonia per day are requiring hospitalization. The majority of patients with pneumonia we are told are infants around the age of 6 months. However, no etiologic agents had apparently been identified at the time of the report.For a discussion of pneumonia in children, please see my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below. ProMED-mail thanks the responder for the above response to a request for information concerning identification of the etiologic agents responsible for this outbreak and if pediatric admissions were being placed more than 1 to a bed or isolette, a practice that would facilitate nosocomial transmission of infectious agents.
