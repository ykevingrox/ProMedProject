Nigerian Bulletin [edited]<http://www.nigerianbulletin.com/threads/how-nigerians-are-enriching-ghanaian-govt-with-their-fake-yellow-fever-cards.171495/>A Leadership article has stated that Nigerians are enriching the Ghanaian government with their fake yellow fever [YF] cards. According to the report, Nigerians travelling to Ghana, or travelling out of Ghana are being made to take yellow fever vaccines at all Ghanaian airports, as many of them have fake yellow cards.Ghana's Health Service has turned eruption of fake yellow fever cards from Nigerian airports into a money spinning venture, by insisting that travellers (who are mostly Nigerians) bearing fake International Certificates of Vaccination, otherwise known as yellow fever cards, are vaccinated at the airport as part of completing immigration rules at the rate of NGN 3000 [about USD 15].Each day, about half a thousand Nigerians are stopped while going through immigration processes at Ghana's airports for having the wrong yellow fever vaccination card, meaning that the Ghana Health Service may be raking in about NGN 1.5 million (19 500 cedis) [about USD 7539] daily at just the Accra airport, into the country's government coffers. From only Accra airport, the country can earn NGN 45 million (585 000 cedis) [about USD 226 176] in one month and possibly NGN 540 million (7.02 million cedis) [about USD 2 613 592] in a year. Moreover, there are other major airports in Ghana such as Kumasi, Tamale, Takoradi and the Sunyani airports and there would be other nationals, including Ghanaians who may have gotten their yellow cards from the airports in Nigeria.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Apparently, the problem of fake YF vaccination cards persists in Nigeria. This was a common practice in Nigeria in 2014 (see archives below). It is not possible to know if the fake cards carried today were left over from that earlier practice, or if fake cards are still being issued in Nigeria. Either way, the sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards to individuals who did not receive the vaccine presents a serious public health problem inside Nigeria and outside of it. Susceptible, unvaccinated individuals can contribute to a YF outbreak within the country. YF virus is endemic in Nigeria, and an unvaccinated, viremic individual with a fake card who becomes infected in Nigeria could carry YF virus to localities where vector mosquitoes are present and initiate an outbreak of this serious disease. One wonders, if the practice of issuance of fake YF cards continues, whether countries that are currently YF-free but are most at risk of ongoing transmission should the virus be introduced, in Central and North America, South and Southeast Asia, will deny visas to or admittance of individuals coming from Nigeria unless they can prove that their cards are legitimate.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62> and a map of Ghana at <http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/africa/gh.htm>. - Mod.TY]
