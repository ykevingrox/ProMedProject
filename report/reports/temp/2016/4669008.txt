Results are awaited.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project Member[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Seif Al-Abri for his very rapid and thorough response to the request for information on results of epidemiologic studies on this most recent case of MERS-CoV reported by Oman. We'd also like to thank the other EpiCore surveillance Project member who provided additional information on contact tracing surrounding this case. As a reminder, In Oman, suspicion of MERS-CoV infection leads to immediate isolation of the suspected case. (see prior ProMED-mail reports on MERS-CoV in Oman earlier this past year).The HealthMap/ProMED map of Oman can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25917>. - Mod.MPP]
