Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/Doctors-remove-8cm-dog-heartworm-from-12-yr-old/articleshow/51350971.cms>Doctors recently detected dirofilaria -- a dog heartworm found in larval form in dogs and in adult form in human beings -- in a 12-year-old girl in Kochi after she complained of pain and swelling in her chest. An ultrasound revealed the presence of an 8cm-worm, which was then surgically removed.Senior paediatrician Dr M Narayanan said he had noticed a swelling of one cm over her breast bone during consultation. ""The mosquito-borne disease is rare in children and is an emerging threat due to the uncontrolled population of stray dogs and mosquitoes,"" he said. Narayanan said the disease was transmitted through mosquito bites. ""No transfer is possible from dog to human or human to human. The worm was alive at the time of removal.Usually, it would continue moving till the body's defense mechanism got activated and formed a cyst around it to prevent its movement,"" he said. Around 10 such cases were reported in Kerala since 1976. Worldwide, 800 cases have been reported to date. ""We are familiar with mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, filariasis, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. But few know that a disease transmitted by mosquitoes from dogs to humans exists,"" he said.Doctors said that 7-24 percent of the domestic dog population in Kerala harbors this larva in their blood. The carriage rate in stray dogs has not been studied; it would be higher considering their increased exposure to mosquitoes. The larvae is transmitted when mosquitoes bite affected dogs.Doctors said most mosquito species in Kerala -- _Anopheles_, _Culex_ and _Aedes_ -- are capable of transmitting the larva to humans. In humans, the adult worms usually settle in the lungs, eyes and subcutaneous tissues and cause cough, pain and swelling. If there is a lesion or swelling in the subcutaneous tissues or eyes, diagnosis and surgical treatment is easier, they said. When worms settle in a patient's lungs, detection and treatment gets difficult.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Dirofilaria immitis_ and _D. repens_ are nematodes of dogs occasionally transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the _Culex_ family. Whether this particular nematode was _D. immitis_ or _D. repens_ can only be determined upon molecular analysis, which probably was not performed. The worm is usually not sensitive to albendazole but needs to be surgically removed. A serological test has been described (Ermakova LA et al. _Dirofilaria repens_ in the Russian Federation: current epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment from a federal reference center perspective. Int J Infect Dis. 2014;23:47-52).Information and a map of Kochi, Kerala, can be found here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi>. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/308>.]
