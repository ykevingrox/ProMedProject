KDVR [edited]<http://kdvr.com/2016/07/18/baby-with-measles-may-have-exposed-people-in-denver-littleton-more/>People might have been exposed to a baby with the measles at stores, a restaurant, medical facilities and other locations in Highlands Ranch, Littleton, Parker, Lone Tree and Denver last week [11-17 Jul 2016], the Tri-County Health Department said Mon [18 Jul 2016] in issuing a warning about the risk of exposure.The baby might have exposed people to the respiratory illness at the locations and times [listed at the URL above]. The health department is advising anyone who visited the locations to contact their health care provider to get vaccinated if they are not already immune.""Measles is a respiratory illness that can be spread by coughing and sneezing, and can be very dangerous for infants who are too young to be vaccinated, immune-compromised people, and those who have not been immunized. Complications include ear infections, pneumonia, and encephalitis (swelling of the brain),"" health department officials stated. Symptoms of measles typically begin 7 to 14 days after exposure. The health department urged people to watch for symptoms, and issued the following information:- Symptoms include a fever of 101 deg F [38 deg C] or higher, a runny nose, red eyes that are sensitive to light, and coughing.- 2 to 4 days after the first symptoms, a red rash starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.- A person can be contagious for 4 days before the rash appears and for up to 4 days after the rash appears. People with measles symptoms should NOT go to childcare, school, work, or out in public, since they may spread the disease to others.- If you need to be seen by a doctor, call the office to tell them about your symptoms. Do not go inside the doctor's office or hospital since measles is highly contagious, and the doctor might meet you outside of the medical office in order to protect other patients and visitors.""As of Sun [17 Jul 2016], evening, every person known to have been in contact with the baby -- or in close proximity at the locations listed -- has been identified and/or personally contacted by the health department, and provided the appropriate preventive measures,"" said John M. Douglas Jr., executive director of Tri-County Health Department. ""This notice to the public is out of an abundance of caution, and any remaining risk is extremely low.""[Byline: Anica Padilla]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Colorado, USA may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209>.

He said the transmission might have migrated from a neighboring country. ""It's an issue that we have to solve,"" he said. ""We still have some intervention in the areas where the cases were identified. People are being provided vaccines.""The immunization program has requested USD 200 000 for operational costs to cover the intervention efforts, Vichit said. It has also requested 200 000 measles vaccines from the Measles and Rubella Initiative, a global organization, to conduct a follow-up intervention effort to vaccinate people in the areas where the 3 prior cases were identified earlier this year [2016], he added.In May, a case was identified in Takeo province's Bati district, where another case had cropped up in January, he said. The 1st case was identified in Kampong Speu's Kong Pisei district in January.A WHO Cambodia expert was not available for comment.[Byline: Yesenia Amaro]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Cambodia may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/145>. - Mod.LK]******[3] Nigeria (Maiduguri): IDP campDate: Tue 12 Jul 2016, 4:44 PMSource: Daily Trust [edited]<http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/general/measles-kills-6-in-maiduguri-idp-camp/155050.html>An outbreak of measles at the ATC Internally Displaced Camp in Maiduguri killed 6 children while 22 people are affected. Officials at the camp attribute the outbreak to congestion as the camp had over 8000 IDPs when the disease broke out.Consequently, officials said 1913 IDPs from Gwoza have been evacuated to Bakassi IDP camp while 345 IDPs from Askira Uba have been returned to their community. Despite the decongestion, officials said the camp is struggling with lack of drugs and doctors.Millions of people were displaced from their homes as a result of Boko Haram's insurgency in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states.[Byline: Shehu Abubakar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maiduguri, also called Yerwa by its locals] is the capital and the largest city of Borno State in north-eastern Nigeria. The city sits along the seasonal Ngadda River which disappears into the Firki swamps in the areas around Lake Chad.It appears internally displaced persons (IDPs) must make a choice between returning home to an area that may not have been fully liberated from the Boko Haram terrorists vs. staying in the poor overcrowded living conditions in their camp.
