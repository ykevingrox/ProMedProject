Washington Post [edited]<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/02/frozen-strawberries-from-egypt-lead-to-70-cases-of-hepatitis-a-in-7-states-including-va-and-md/>As of early Friday morning [2 Sep 2016], 70 cases of hepatitis A in 7 states have been linked to tainted frozen strawberries shipped to the United States from Egypt and served by a popular smoothie restaurant chain. Most of the cases of the liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus are in the Mid-Atlantic area.With 55 confirmed cases, Virginia contains the bulk of the outbreak. Six more cases were confirmed in Maryland, 5 in West Virginia, and one in North Carolina, Wisconsin, New York and Oregon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday [1 Sep 2016]. As of now, 32 people have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported.The number of confirmed cases -- which The Washington Post reported to be 35 last Friday [26 Aug 2016], after the Virginia Health Department announced that a Northern Virginia restaurant worker had been diagnosed with the disease -- has been steadily growing throughout the week.The strawberries appear to have been served in Tropical Smoothie Cafe, a company that began in Tallahassee [Florida] in 1997. It now boasts more than 500 locations across the United States, including a cluster in Northern Virginia. These particular strawberries appear to have been consumed at locations in Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, CDC reported on Thursday [1 Sep 2016].The cases in other states also appear to be linked to these locations. The person in Oregon, for example, had traveled to Virginia and consumed a smoothie containing strawberries there.Mike Rotondo, the chief executive of Tropical Smoothie Cafe, addressed the outbreak in a video posted to the company's Facebook page. In it, Rotondo apologized to those who had fallen ill and said, ""'Eat better, feel better' is not just a marketing slogan. It's a promise."" He said the Virginia Department of Health contacted the company on 5 Aug [2016] to inform it of a potential link between the hepatitis A cases and strawberries the cafe was using in its smoothies. ""We voluntarily and immediately removed all of those strawberries from all of our cafes,"" he said. ""And we have sourced new strawberries for every location.""Though Tropical Smoothie Cafe was alerted of the potential outbreak on 5 Aug [2016], the Virginia Department of Health did not publicly announce its investigation until 19 Aug [2016]. ""I think it's important for the Virginia Department of Health and Tropical Smoothie Cafe to say why they didn't alert the public sooner,"" Bill Marler, a Seattle [Washington] food safety attorney who is representing outbreak victims, told Food Safety News. ""By not coming forward they kept people who had been exposed from having the opportunity to protect themselves and their families from hepatitis A.""Diane Woolard, director of the health department's division of surveillance and investigation, said the department needed to gather more information before publicly announcing the potential outbreak. ""We did not know for sure where the frozen strawberries were distributed, if the risk was associated with one restaurant chain or more general to other potential sources, if it was limited to Virginia or it extended further. We wanted more information to feel confident that the source was strawberries and not other fruits, especially since smoothies contain so many ingredients,"" Woolard told Food Safety News.[byline: Travis M Andrews]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As suspected, given that this is thought to be from an imported product from Egypt, it seemed likely that it will involve other locations and now other states are involved. The ages of those infected are not stated but are likely to be adults or children born outside the USA since universal HAV vaccine is part of standard childhood immunization in the USA. Also, there are likely to be substantially more cases as even in adults, many of the cases are subclinical or anicteric. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
