WVTM13 [Edited]<http://www.wvtm13.com/news/alabama-sees-influx-in-tickborne-illness/40918382>Most people hike through the woods and hardly think about just how many ticks are waiting in the weeds. ""Hadn't had any concern for ticks, but just in general, I try to keep him out of the brush or thick grass,"" [a woman] said. What they don't love is tons of bug spray. [Another woman] coats her ankles, socks and shoes because she said ticks travel from the ground up. They latch onto 2 other common spots that are your waist and behind your ears. That's why it's so important to check your body and your animals. ""Any place that kind of bends or creases. Between your fingernails and between your toes. That's where they like to hide out,"" [the woman] said. Oftentimes, ticks go undetected until it's too late.Over the last 12 months, the Alabama Department of Public Health has seen 40 new cases of Lyme disease and 346 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, another tick-borne illness.""Don't slap them. Because their exoskeletons are so hard, you want to pinch them or burn them, or flush them down the toilet. If you just smack them, they will survive that and they'll be crawling around your house,"" Ahrnsen said.[Byline: Sheri Falk]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In the U.S., the incidence of Lyme disease is highly concentrated in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central states, where the incidence rates varied from 14.4 to 70.5 / 100 000 in 2014, in contrast to the southeastern states, where the incidence rates were less than 1/100 000 in 2014 (1). A map of the U.S. showing the distribution of Lyme disease cases can be found at (2). Multiple reasons might explain these differences in regional Lyme disease incidence, including a truly greater number of infections, associated with greater densities and biting propensity of _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected _Ixodes_ ticks and greater encroachment of human development into tick-infested rural and suburban areas, but also possibly enhanced surveillance, increased awareness among health-care professionals and the public in the high incidence states. In addition, the occurrence of southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), a condition that can resemble early Lyme disease clinically, but is not thought to be caused by _B. burgdorferi_, complicates Lyme disease surveillance in southeastern U.S. However, in 2014 the number of confirmed Lyme disease cases in the southeastern state of Alabama went from 13 in 2012 and 11 in 2013 to 28 in 2014 and the incidence rates from 0.3 and 0.2 to 0.6/100 000, respectively (1). The above news report says that now over the last 12 months, the Alabama Department of Public Health has seen 40 new cases of Lyme disease. How many of these are confirmed cases of Lyme disease is not stated.Another reason postulated for regional differences is the geographic variation in _Borrelia_ species causing Lyme disease. _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex includes over 20 genospecies, not all of which are known to cause human disease (3). In Europe, _Borrelia garinii_ and _Borrelia afzelii_, and to a lesser extent _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu stricto cause Lyme disease; whereas in the U.S., _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto cause over 90 percent of cases. Molecular evidence has also implicated _Borrelia americana_ and _Borrelia andersonii_ in cases in the southeast, _Borrelia bissettii_ in California, and _Borrelia mayonii_ in the north-central region (4-6).Different clinical manifestations are often associated with these different genospecies. Erythema migrans (EM) and Lyme arthritis are more common in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., as many as 80-90 percent of patients with Lyme disease develop the characteristic EM rash (7); whereas neuroborreliosis (or Lyme disease affecting the nervous system), borrelial lymphocytoma (bluish-red nodular swelling), and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans occur more frequently in Europe.Genetic differences between species within the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex may result in problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis (8). However, ELISAs using the C6 peptide are reported to overcome these problems (9). Some cases that were positive for _B. americana_ and _B. andersonii_ on molecular testing were negative by standard ELISA testing (3). Whether the C6 ELISA will overcome these problems remains to be shown.1. <http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>2. <http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/633.long>3. <http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html>4.
