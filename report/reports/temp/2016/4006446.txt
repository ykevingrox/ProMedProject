Food Safety News [edited]<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/02/six-kids-sickened-in-outbreak-linked-to-organic-pastures-raw-milk/#.VrqhSko8KrX>On Mon 8 Feb 2016, state officials said 4 of 6 California children in a confirmed _E. coli_ outbreak cluster drank unpasteurized raw milk from Organic Pastures Dairy Co. before becoming ill in January 2016. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reported lab tests show all 6 children had the same unique strain of Shiga-toxin producing _E. coli_ O157. Some of the children required hospitalization. Health officials said it is investigating the possibility of additional victims.""CDPH is continuing to work with local health departments to identify potential case patients that might be associated with this cluster of illnesses,"" a health department spokesman said. The department's Food and Drug Branch (FDB) collected a number of samples from the marketplace. Test results were not yet available on 8 Feb 2016 according to the state health department spokesman.The dairy owners are aware of the illnesses and are cooperating with the investigation, CDPH officials said. ""FDB has also initiated an environmental investigation at the dairy, but since that investigation is ongoing, we cannot provide any specifics at this time.""Mark McAfee, founder and CEO of the Fresno-based dairy, said [Mon 8 Feb 2016] the state had collected hundreds of samples from the dairy and none were positive. The dairy recalled 2 lots of its whole, raw milk via its Facebook page at 9 pm 4 Feb 2016. One lot had an expiration date of 23 Jan 2016. The other expired 26 Jan 2016. Organic Pastures also posted the recall on its website. ""Our food safety program saved the day,"" McAfee said [Mon 8 Feb 2016] when asked about the CDPH report. ""It worked extremely well. We're proud of that.""McAfee said the test-and-hold procedure at the 500-cow dairy isn't a 100 percent guarantee that pathogens are not present in Organic Pastures raw milk products. Raw milk is not pasteurized, which kills harmful germs and bacteria including _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_, and _Listeria_.The Organic Pastures testing procedure apparently failed on 6 Jan 2016, when a batch of raw, unpasteurized milk returned a false negative, McAfee said. The milk was distributed. That false negative wasn't apparent until last week [week of 1 Feb 2016], he said. On 7 Jan 2016, a test on a batch of raw milk returned a positive result. McAfee said that raised a red flag. That milk was not distributed under the Organic Pastures brand. McAfee said he sold it to a company that pasteurizes milk. ""We'll never know for sure that the negative was actually false,"" McAfee said of the 6 Jan 2016 test.He said the current situation is the first of its kind and that the dairy is working with state officials and researchers at the University of California-Davis to learn from it.""The scientists always tell us that _E. coli_ comes from manure. But we had a cow with _E. coli_ on the inside of her udder. That's never happened before,"" McAfee said. The animal tested negative on [7 Jan 2016] and positive for _E. coli_ on [8 Jan 2016]. The dairy immediately quarantined the cow, McAfee said. ""All of our manure tests are negative. ... We spend thousands a month on food safety.""The dairy is now double testing its raw products before distribution, McAfee said. The company's website references triple testing. ""If anyone has ever been made sick by our milk we want to talk to them,"" McAfee said.Previous recalls and foodborne illness outbreaks linked to Organic Pastures in the past decade include:October 2015: Organic Pastures raw milk recall and quarantine after CDFA [California Department of Food and Agriculture] inspectors found _Campylobacter_ as a result of product testing conducted as part of routine inspection and sample collection at the facility.September 2012: Organic Pastures raw milk recall and quarantine after CDFA inspectors found _Campylobacter_ bacteria as a result of product testing conducted as part of routine inspection and sample collection at the facility.January-April 2012: Organic Pastures products linked to campylobacteriosis outbreak. Raw milk, raw skim milk, raw cream, and raw butter were recalled and the dairy quarantined after the confirmed detection of _Campylobacter_ in raw cream. State officials identified at least 10 people with campylobacteriosis throughout California. They reported consuming Organic Pastures raw milk prior to illness onset. Their median age was 11.5 years, with 6 younger than 18. The age range was 9 months to 38 years.August-October 2011: Organic Pastures products linked to _E. coli_ outbreak. A cluster of 5 young children with _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections with matching pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns was identified. Illness onsets were from 25 Aug 2011 to 25 Oct 2011. All 5 children reported drinking commercially available raw milk from a single dairy, Organic Pastures, and had no other common exposures.Investigations by the CDPH's Food and Drug Branch and the California Department of Food and Agriculture showed environmental samples collected at Organic Pastures yielded _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from the patient isolates.September 2008: Organic Pastures Grade A raw cream recall and quarantine after state testing and confirmation testing detected campylobacter bacteria in the cream.September 2007: Organic Pastures Grade A raw cream recall and quarantine following laboratory confirmation of the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria. CDFA inspectors found the bacteria as a result of product testing conducted as part of routine inspection and sample collection at the facility.November-December 2007: Organic Pastures cows linked to _Campylobacter_ outbreak. State officials found 50 strains of _C. jejuni_ plus _C. coli_, _C. fetus_, _C. hyointestinalis_, and _C. lari_ when they cultured feces from Organic Pastures dairy cow feces. There was only 1 patient isolate available for DNA fingerprinting, but it was identical to isolates from four cattle fecal samples collected at Organic Pastures.September 2006: Organic Pastures linked to _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak. 6 sick children were identified by state officials. 4 had culture-confirmed infections, one had a culture-confirmed infection and HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure and stroke), and one had HUS only. The median age of patients was 8 years, with a range of 6 to 18 years. Organic Pastures' operators claimed the illnesses were linked to consumption of fresh spinach that was linked to a separate _E. coli_ outbreak in 2006. However, the 5 children who consumed Organic Pastures' products who had culture confirmation were laboratory matches to each other and the CDC reported their specific _E. coli_ isolates ""differed markedly from the patterns of the concurrent _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak strain associated with spinach consumption.""[Byline: Coral Beach]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 (<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article>), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
