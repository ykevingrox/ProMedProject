Noticias SIN [in Spanish, trans. Mod.JG, edited]<http://noticiassin.com/2016/12/ms-reporta-aumento-de-casos-de-leptospirosis-en-el-pais/> The Ministry of Health, in its bulletin for the 46th Epidemiological Week from the General Direction of Epidemiology (DIGEPI, according to its Spanish initials), reported 502 suspected cases of leptospirosis, including 42 deceased persons. Leptospirosis is endemic but the incidence increases during the rainy season. 41 (98 percent) of the deaths occurred in males between 14 and 79 years of age, with a median age of 29 years.A spokesman from the Ministry pointed out that it is thought that the conditions following Hurricane Matthew during the last 4 epidemiological weeks (43rd-46th) and the continuous rainfall that affected the island during the last 2 months have lead to a 5.3 times increase in the lethality rate (of leptospirosis) compared to the same period last year [2015].The increased lethality of leptospirosis should remind the citizens of the need of avoiding entering mud, stagnant water; and, certainly, never take baths in water from rainfalls.The Ministry of Health also reminds the population to thoroughly wash with soap and chlorinated water all recipients and plates for food.-- Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Leptospirosis was previously reported in ProMED-mail posts in the Dominican Republic in January 2001, 2006, 2007, 2011, and 2012 (see archives below). In 2006, it was attributed to ""sanitary problems and to deficiencies in municipal garbage collection."" Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Also, outbreaks of leptospirosis in the Dominican Republic frequently follow heavy rainfall and ensuing fresh water flooding.For discussions of leptospirosis, see ProMED-mail posts Leptospirosis - Dominican Republic: fatal, susp 20121114.1409325 and Leptospirosis - Dominican Republic 20071124.3804.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of the Dominican Republic can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24>. - Mod.ML]
