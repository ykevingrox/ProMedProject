As recently as 2008, only 9 cases were reported in the county.""I think doctors are diagnosing more cases they might have missed in the past because they are more aware of Lyme disease,"" said Nancy Weissbach, M.D., Saint Vincent Hospital's chief of infectious diseases. ""But I also think there are more cases out there because there are more (infected) ticks.""Lyme disease, a bacterial infection, is spread to humans primarily by deer ticks. The number of cases in the county has increased as infected ticks have migrated from Presque Isle State Park, where they were 1st found in the 1980s, to wooded and grassy areas throughout the county.Lyme disease cases in Erie County by year: 2012 - 14 [cases]; 2013 - 25; 2014 - 55; 2015 - 71; [and] 2016 - 179 (through 16 Dec 2016).Source: Erie County Department of Health: ""Even though it's been cold lately, all it takes is one warm day, and we get calls about ticks,"" said Breanna Adams, an environmental protection specialist with the health department.Doctors are concerned about an increase in cases because Lyme disease can cause serious health problems or death if left untreated. The good news is that Lyme disease is often cured in its initial stage with a single dose of the antibiotic doxycycline.""It's so important to catch Lyme disease in its early stages or prevent it by avoiding tick bites,"" Weissbach said. The best way to reduce your risk of acquiring Lyme disease is to take precautions when walking in the woods or grassy areas. You should always wear long-sleeved shirts and tuck your pants into your socks to prevent ticks from climbing onto your skin. Spray your clothing with the insect repellent permethrin, though don't spray it directly onto your skin. Use a different repellent with Deet on your skin. Once you return home, take off all your clothes and check your entire body for ticks. Pay close attention to the armpits, scalp and other dark, moist areas where ticks like to feed.Ticks transmit Lyme disease as they feed, and it usually takes them at least 24 hours after they crawl onto a host to begin feeding. If you can easily swipe them off your skin and they aren't engorged with blood, they haven't fed. If they are firmly attached to your skin, use a pair of needle-nosed pliers to remove them. Make sure to remove the entire tick by puling upward with steady, even pressure. ""Then go to your physician's office and ask for a preventative dose of antibiotics,"" Weissbach said.You should also see a physician if you notice any common symptoms of Lyme disease, including fever, chills, headache, fatigue or a red rash often in the shape of a bull's-eye. Left untreated, the symptoms often disappear, but the disease often returns with more serious symptoms including joint pain, neurological problems and -- in rare cases -- heart problems, hepatitis or death. ""Lyme disease can still often be treated at a later stage with intravenous antibiotics for about a month,"" Weissbach said. ""But it's better when it's found earlier.""[Byline: David Bruce]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 28 Dec 2016Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/lyme-disease-tally-tops-12000-pennsylvania-38313/>Pennsylvania has reported the most Lyme disease cases for ten consecutive years and in 2016, while not over yet, has topped 12 000 cases, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. Through Dec. 24, the Keystone State has seen 12 092 cases (provisional), the most reported.Nationally, 31 926 provisional cases have been reported to CDC. Following Pennsylvania is New York and NYC [New York City] with 4002 cases, New Jersey (3850), Wisconsin (1868) and Maryland (1717).Each year, more than 30 000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to CDC, making it the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the United States. However, CDC estimates indicate that the number of Americans diagnosed with Lyme disease each year is around 300 000, 10 times higher than the yearly reported number.According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and is often transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick, also known as a deer tick. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, a bull's eye rash may appear, and other symptoms that can be mistaken for viral infections, such as influenza or infectious mononucleosis. Joint pain can be mistaken for other types of arthritis, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), and neurologic signs of Lyme disease can mimic those caused by other conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).When detected early, Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics. Left untreated, the disease can spread to the joints, heart and nervous system.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[For discussions of Lyme borreliosis, please see the moderator's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts found in the ""see alsos"" below.Erie County, with a population of 280 566 residents, is located in the northwestern corner of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania along the shore of Lake Erie (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_County,_Pennsylvania>).
