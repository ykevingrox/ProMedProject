NBC Philadelphia [edited]<http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/health/Three-Pistachio-Brands-Recalled-371641511.html>A pistachio recall announced last week over salmonellosis concerns has been expanded to include 6 brands, according to the FDA.Wonderful, Paramount Farms and Trader Joe's voluntarily recalled in-shell and shelled pistachios 10 Mar 2016 after the CDC notified the companies of the possible contamination. The recalled pistachios, all produced by Wonderful Pistachios, have ""best by"" dates between 26 Oct and 6 Nov 2016. The recall was expanded Mon 14 Mar 2016 to include Fresh Choice, Southern Grove and Nature's Eats pistachios produced by the Texas Star Nut & Food Company. The pistachios in question were sold nationwide between 13 Aug 2015, and 24 Feb 2016, according to the FDA, which lists the affected products on its website.Consumers should throw away affected pistachios and return the empty packages to the place of purchase for a refund.11 people in 9 states were infected with salmonellosis linked to nuts included in the original recall. 2 were hospitalized, according to the CDC. No illnesses have been reported in connection with nuts produced by Texas Star Nut & Food Company, the FDA said.[Byline: Patty Espinosa]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@2promedmail.org>[The following was extracted from <https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2016/how-does-salmonella-get-on-pistachios/>: ""The current _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to recalled Wonderful pistachios brings up a question: how does _Salmonella_ get on pistachios? Most of us are familiar with problems with _Salmonella_ on poultry and in eggs. But a dry, shelf-stable product such as pistachios doesn't seem to be a candidate for these bacteria.""Unfortunately, _Salmonella_ can live for a long time on dry products, according to research published in the Journal of Food Protection in October 2015. _Salmonella_ can survive for at least 6 months on foods that are very dry, and will not grow, but survive, on foods that are refrigerated or frozen. And, as we have told you before, any product, including produce, which includes nuts, can be contaminated with bacteria.""There have been 89 recalls of nut butters and nuts for pathogenic bacterial contamination since 2001 in the United States, 25 just in 2015. Most of those recalls have occurred since 2012. And there have been 12 outbreaks linked to nut and nut butter products since 2001, sickening at least 1275 people in the USA.""There has been an ongoing debate about the safety of raw nuts versus roasted or heat-treated nuts. Many people believe that, once heated, nuts lose some of their nutritional quality, including fats, enzymes, and beneficial bacteria. Almonds are a particular hot spot, especially since 2007, when the FDA ordered that all out-of-shell almonds sold in this country be ""pasteurized"" before sale, because they have been linked to so many food poisoning outbreaks.""But even nuts that are heat treated can become contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. Problems in the processing facilities and in transport can contaminate any product."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
