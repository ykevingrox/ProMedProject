The most concerning are those that end in India, with its huge population. If it lands there and spreads, there will never be enough vaccine to contain it. WHO exhausted its global stockpile in Angola, and is trying hard to get more released from contracts to other users. Any increase in production by manufacturers is constrained by the need for it to be made in AVF (avian flu free) eggs.In many ways, the production of an advanced yellow fever vaccine is only at the stage that Ebola vaccines have already reached. Subunit yellow fever vaccines are still at the experimental stage, years away from replacing those produced in eggs. Ireland produces AVF eggs, but scaling up production in the 4 active producers will take time.However, there is a way to stretch existing supplies. Studies have shown that they can be used at a 1/5th or even 1/10th lower dose without loss of efficacy in adults (ref: Monath TP, Woodall JP, Gubler DJ, et al. Yellow fever vaccine supply: a possible solution. Lancet. 2016; 387(10028); 1599-1600. Abstract available at < <http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30195-7/abstract >)There may be some question about the immunity and its duration in children, and the possible need for a future booster dose, but here is a golden opportunity to test that in the field -- bearing in mind that many children have already been vaccinated once already through national EPI programs. If their immunity does wear off faster than in adults, it should still be adequate to reduce child mortality in an epidemic.So 5 million doses of vaccine could be stretched to 50 million, which would make a huge difference to the supply situation. It would also release vaccine to cover the 7 districts that Uganda wishes to vaccinate in its far southwest, and unblock the border between Uganda and Kenya, where hundreds of people have been waiting for days to cross. News media are reporting that unvaccinated people are being allowed to cross on payment of a fee, which is a dangerous situation.Use of a smaller dose would require smaller (0.05ml) AD (auto-destruct) syringes, already in use, from the WHO Syringe Catalogue <http://apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/categorypage.aspx?id_cat=37>. Countries that are willing to accept the low-dose vaccine, if authorized, and need to contribute from their own budget to vaccination, should assure their supplies of the smaller syringes now. The immediate need is not mass vaccination, but out of an abundance of caution to protect health and essential services personnel. It is hoped that international donors will recognize this need and assist at-risk countries accordingly for the ultimate protection of their own populations.A future informational post will discuss mosquito control and personal protection, none of which can reduce mortality as effectively as vaccination.--John P ""Jack"" Woodall, PhDCo-founder & Associate Editor, ProMED-mail[I declare my interest: I researched yellow fever in Uganda and Brazil for 14 years, and was a staff member (epidemiologist) of CDC and WHO for a further 14 years. - Mod.JWEarly case detection and logistical planning are essential in order to quickly focus vaccination efforts where most urgent. Extreme vigilance will be needed at high-risk destinations including both formal and informal systems -- with adequate lab capacity-- for the early detection of cases of yellow fever. Early detection will allow the directing of vaccination and vector control to the areas most at risk. - Mods.TY/LM]A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8854>.][See Also:Yellow fever - Africa (42): Congo DR (Kinshasa) 20160416.4164060Yellow fever - Africa (41): Uganda (MQ) susp, RFI 20160414.4159929Yellow fever - Africa (40): Angola, WHO 20160414.4158727Yellow fever - Africa (39): Uganda (MQ) 20160413.4157158Yellow fever - China (08): ex Angola 20160413.4156986Yellow fever - Africa (38): Angola (HM) 20160412.4155494Yellow fever - Africa (37): Congo DR 20160412.4155377Yellow fever - Africa (36): Uganda (MQ) 20160411.4153034Yellow fever - Africa (35): Angola 20160409.4149455Yellow fever - Africa (34): Angola, WHO 20160404.4137096Yellow fever - China (07): ex Angola 20160403.4136699Yellow fever - Africa (33): Cameroon, fake vaccine alert 20160331.4131690Yellow fever - China (06): ex Angola, WHO, bednets, CFR corr 20160330.4126611Yellow fever - Africa (32): Angola 20160329.4126331Yellow fever - Africa (31): Congo DR, imported only, prevention 20160328.4122415Yellow fever - Africa (30): Mauritania ex Angola 20160326.4119691Yellow fever - Africa (29): Angola 20160326.4119621Yellow fever - China (05): ex Angola 20160325.4119422Yellow fever - Africa (28): Angola, Chinese workers 20160324.4116627Yellow fever - Africa (27): Angola, WHO 20160323.4114429Yellow fever - China (04): ex Angola 20160322.4109684Yellow fever - Africa (26): Congo DR 20160320.4107262Yellow fever - China (03): ex Angola 20160319.4106312Yellow fever - Africa (25): Angola comment 20160319.4106114Yellow fever - China (02): ex Angola 20160318.4105105Yellow fever - Africa (24): Kenya ex Angola 20160318.4104819Yellow fever - Africa (23): Angola (HL) 20160317.4102488Yellow fever - Africa (22): Kenya ex Angola 20160316.4097945Yellow fever - Africa (21): Angola 20160315.4095607Yellow fever - Africa (20): Angola, Lebanese expats, fake cards susp. 20160315.4095387Yellow fever - Africa (19): Congo DR ex Angola, susp. 20160314.4093047Yellow fever - Africa (18): Angola 20160313.4090378Yellow fever - China: ex Angola, 1st case in Asia 20160313.4089857Yellow fever - Africa (17): Angola 20160310.4084268Yellow fever - Africa (16): Angola 20160227.4053826Yellow fever - Africa (15): Angola, fake vaccine, SE Asia, WHO alert 20160224.4047041Yellow fever - Africa (14): Angola 20160223.4044335Yellow fever - Africa (13): Angola (HL) 20160219.4033812Yellow fever - Africa (12): Angola 20160213.4019319Yellow fever - Africa (11): Angola 20160211.4012749Yellow fever - Africa (10): Angola (HM) 20160210.4010453Yellow fever - Africa (09): Angola 20160208.4003005Yellow fever - Africa (08): Angola RFI 20160204.3995342Yellow fever - Africa (07): Angola (LU) RFI 20160201.3984228Yellow fever - Africa (06): Nigeria, fake cards 20160129.3977690Yellow fever - Africa (05): Angola (HL) 20160129.3977685Yellow fever - Africa (04) Angola (LU) conf, RFI 20160127.3965357Yellow fever - Africa (03) Angola (LU) comment, RFI 20160123.3959897Yellow fever - Africa (02): Angola (LU) RFI 20160122.3958601].................................................jw/ty/lm/ao/sh"
