The Tribune [edited]<http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/state/california/article110492332.html>California's rate of sexually transmitted diseases [STDs] is at a 20-year high. The California Department of Public Health said the state ranks 1st for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and congenital syphilis. And the rates are up for the 2nd year in a row. ""Cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia are going up in California at a concerning rate,"" Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health, said Tuesday [25 Oct 2016]. ""This is the 2nd year in a row that we have seen increases in all 3 diseases."" The report found an 11.6 percent increase in STDs from 2014, with a total of 249 224 reportable cases in California for 2015.State health officials cite less condom use, people having sex with more partners and barriers to care and testing as reasons for the rising STD rates. Improved reporting of the diseases by public health agencies could also be a contributing factor, the state said.Syphilis is still the least common of the 3 STDs, but is particularly worrisome because it has led to resurgence in congenital syphilis, in which an infected pregnant mother transmits the disease to her newborn baby. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriages, stillbirths, jaundice and meningitis. There were 142 babies born with syphilis in California in 2015, a big jump from 30 cases in 2012. California now has the 2nd highest rate of congenital syphilis nationwide.Fresno County health officials said social media could be fueling the increase in STDs statewide by providing an easy means for people to have multiple sexual partners. But in Fresno County, drug use is driving an epidemic of syphilis cases. The county had the 2nd-highest rate of syphilis in the state in 2015.""As a general rule, syphilis had primarily been an illness of men having sex with men, but now in our community it's with people who use methamphetamine and it's taken off just like wildfire,"" said Dr. Ken Bird, the county's health officer. Methamphetamine users tend to have several sexual partners and they tend not to use condoms, Bird said.California's STD rates are highest among people 15 to 24 years old and especially females. Gay and bisexual men are also at high risk.California's in the process of giving USD 5 million in grants to county health departments for STD prevention, testing and treatment.COUNTY STD RATES (Rates are per 100 000 population)-------------------------------------------------------------------------County / Chlamydia / Gonorrhea / SyphilisFresno / 608.2 / 180 / 27.3Los Angeles / 506.6 / 172.8 / 15.6Monterey / 410.2 / 70 / 8.3Sacramento / 565.8 / 192.8 / 15San Luis Obispo / 392.2 / 61.2 / 3.6Santa Barbara / 514.8 / 75.4 / 9--------------------------------------------California / 486.1 / 138.9 / 12.5[Byline: Barbara Anderson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] 2015 CDC National ReportDate: 19 Oct 2016Source: CDC Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2015 [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/std-surveillance-2015-print.pdf>National Overview of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), 2015---------------------------------------------------------------Chlamydia---------In 2015, a total of 1 526 658 cases of _Chlamydia trachomatis_ infection were reported to the CDC. This case count corresponds to a rate of 478.8 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 5.9 percent compared with the rate in 2014. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported _Chlamydia_ cases among women increased 3.8 percent and the rate among men increased 10.5 percent. Following 3 years of decreases in rates during 2011-2014, the rate among women aged 15-19 years increased 1.5 percent during 2014-2015.In 2015, the overall rate of chlamydial infection in the United States among women (645.5 cases per 100 000 females) based on reported cases was over 2 times the rate among men (305.2 cases per 100 000 males), reflecting the larger number of women screened for this infection. However, with the increased availability of urine testing and extragenital testing, men, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) are increasingly being tested for chlamydial infection. During 2011-2015, the chlamydia rate in men increased 20.0 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in women during this period.Gonorrhea---------In 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases reached an historic low of 98.1 cases per 100 000 population. However, during 2009-2012, the rate increased slightly each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012 and then increased again during 2013-2015. In 2015, 395 216 gonorrhea cases were reported for a rate of 123.9 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 12.8 percent from 2014.During 2014-2015 the rate of reported gonorrhea increased 18.3 percent among men and 6.8 percent among women. Gonorrhea rates among both men and women increased in every region of the United States, with largest increases in the West and the South. The magnitude of the increase among males suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (e.g., through increased extra-genital screening) among MSM or both.In 2015, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases remained highest among Blacks (424.9 cases per 100 000 population) and among American Indians/Alaska Natives (192.8 cases per 100 000 population). While rates of gonorrhea declined 4 percent among Blacks during 2011-2015, rates increased among all other racial and ethnic groups, including a 71.3 percent increase among American Indians/Alaska Natives.Antimicrobial resistance remains an important consideration in the treatment of gonorrhea. With increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones and declining susceptibility to cefixime, dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is now the only CDC recommended treatment for gonorrhea. In 2015, the percentage of MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of cefixime and ceftriaxone remained low (0.5 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively). During 2013-2015, the percentage of isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility increased from 0.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns to these antibiotics is critical.Syphilis--------In 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest rate since reporting began in 1941. However, the P&S syphilis rate has increased almost every year since 2001. In 2015, a total of 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported, and the national P&S syphilis rate increased to 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, a 19.0 percent increase from 2014.During 2014-2015, the P&S syphilis rate increased both among men (18.1 percent) and women (27.3 percent) and rates increased among both sexes in every region of the country. Nationally, P&S syphilis rates increased in every 5-year age group among those aged 15-64 years and in every racial and ethnic group except for American Indians/ Alaska Natives during 2014-2015.During 2000-2015, the rise in the P&S syphilis rate was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among MSM. In 2015, men accounted for over 90 percent of all cases of P&S syphilis. Of those male cases for whom sex of sex partner was known, 81.7 percent were MSM. Reported cases of P&S syphilis continued to be characterized by a high rate of HIV co-infection, particularly among MSM. In the 31 states able to classify at least 70 percent of reported P&S syphilis cases as MSM, men who have sex with women (MSW), or women and at least 70 percent of reported cases as HIV-positive or HIV-negative, 49.8 percent of MSM with P&S syphilis were also reported as HIV-positive compared with 10.0 percent of cases among MSW and 3.9 percent of cases among women.The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. During 2013-2014, the rate increased 27.2 percent and during 2014-2015 increased 6.0 percent, primarily attributable to an increase in the West. There were 487 cases of congenital syphilis reported in 2015 compared with 461 in 2014. Rates of congenital syphilis were highest among Blacks (35.2 cases per 100 000 live births), followed by Hispanics (15.5 cases per 100 000 live births) and American Indians/Alaska Natives (10.3 cases per 100 000 live births).[The full report is available at the source URL.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The CDC is reporting that the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. reached an all-time high last year (2015). The reported incidences rose from 2014 by 5.9 percent for chlamydia, 12.8 percent for gonorrhea, and a 19 percent for primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis.Because chlamydial infections are usually asymptomatic, the number of infections identified and reported can increase as more people are screened. Consequently rates of reported cases of chlamydia are influenced not only by actual changes in incidence of infection, but also by improved screening coverage. Also use of more sensitive tests (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and more complete reporting contributed to increasing incidence rates.After having reached a historic low in 2009, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased again during 2014-2015, largely attributable to increases among men, accompanied by the emergence of decreased susceptibility and resistance to cephalosporins and azithromycin. As with chlamydial infection, screening practices (e.g., screening for chlamydia with tests that also detect gonococcal infections or increased screening at extra-genital anatomic sites), the broader use of nucleic acid amplification tests, and changes in reporting practices have contributed to the increased incidence rates.After reaching historic lows in 2000 and 2001, the national rate of reported P&S syphilis cases increased almost every year since then. This increase was largely attributable to an increase among men, and in particular among men who have sex with men (MSM). However, during 2014-2015, rates increased among both men and women in every region of the country. Accompanying the increase in women, rates of reported congenital syphilis cases also increased during 2014-2015, although this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the West. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
