I have seen the blood culture report shared by him.--Mohammed Parvez, MD (A.B.I.M.)<mparvez4@yahoo.com>[_Rhizobium_ species are Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen in association with roots of legumes to form root nodules. They rarely cause infections in humans. _Rhizobium_ infections have been reported to occur in compromised and hospitalized patients. Contaminated intravenous catheters have commonly been cited as the source of infection. The organisms seed foreign bodies, e.g., prosthetic valves or intraocular lens implant, and resolution has frequently depended on removal the foreign body.The following is extracted from the introduction of a case series of 13 patients with _Rhizobium radiobacter_ infections in Taiwan (1): ""Strains of the _Rhizobium_ species (formerly _Agrobacterium_, which was reclassified based on 16S rDNA analyses) are aerobic, motile, oxidase-positive, and non--spore-forming gram-negative bacilli [1-4]. Among the species of _Rhizobium_ (i.e., _R. radiobacter_, _R. rhizogenes_, _R. rubi_, _R. undicola_, and _R. vitis_), _R. radiobacter_ is the species that most commonly causes disease in humans [3, 4]. Since the first case of human infection with _R. radiobacter_, in a patient with prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis, was reported in 1980 [5], _R. radiobacter_ has been recognized as an opportunistic human pathogen [1, 6, 7]. Most of patients with _R. radiobacter_ infection have debilitating underlying diseases [1, 6-20]. The clinical presentations associated with _R. radiobacter_ infection are protean, and bacteremia caused by this organism is usually secondary to the use of intravenous catheters (5, 8, 14, 16, 17). The majority of patients with _R. radiobacter_ infection have appeared to respond well to antibiotic therapy. In addition, a significant aspect of therapy is the removal of foreign material, because patients who have persistent infection or who initially respond to therapy risk experiencing relapse until the foreign body is removed. The outcome of infection with _R. radiobacter_ is favorable [1, 7].""1. Chih-Cheng Lai, Lee-Jene Teng, Po-Ren Hsueh, Ang Yuan, et al.
