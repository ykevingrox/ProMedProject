MedicalXpress [edited]<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-02-yellow-fever-death-toll-angola.html>An ongoing yellow fever epidemic in Angola has killed 99 people out of 462 suspected cases since 30 Dec [2015], statistics showed [Mon 22 Feb 2016], despite government attempts to quell the outbreak.The centre of the health crisis is the capital Luanda's eastern suburb of Viana where 29 dead out of 173 suspected cases have been reported, according to the health ministry.There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease, which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and found in tropical regions of Africa and Latin America's Amazon region.Authorities launched a mass vaccination campaign earlier this month [February 2016].The government has also appealed to residents to sterilise stagnant water before drinking it.Yellow fever vaccinations are routinely recommended for travellers to Angola, though the country had not previously seen a significant outbreak since 1986.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Despite the vaccination campaign moving along quickly in the Luanda area, the outbreak continues to grow. A recent report indicated that the vaccine supply was not adequate to provide universal coverage. No mention of the shortage was made in the report above, so one hopes the supply is now adequate.Once again, no mention is made of vaccination activities in the other focus of infection, in Huila province.The Angola outbreak illustrates the need for diagnosis and rapid response as early as possible to minimize spread of the disease. Although 70 percent of the population reportedly has been vaccinated against yellow fever previously, obviously there are enough unvaccinated susceptible individuals to sustain ongoing transmission and spread. This outbreak illustrates why pre-outbreak contingency plans need to be in place to facilitate swift reaction when the 1st cases appear.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>; of Viana in relation to Luanda at <http://becoangola.com/imagens/viana.gif>. - Mod.TY]
