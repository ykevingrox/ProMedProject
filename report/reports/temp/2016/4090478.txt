One of them was from the (Kibaale district) Northern Division of Kabale Municipality and another from the sub-county of Kamuganguzi.[Byline: Anthony Kushaba]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alertspromed@promedmail.org[No mention is made of cases of Rift Vally fever (RVF) in domesgtic animals in the area where the human cases occurred. Farm animals are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus. RVF outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune. RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.As Mod.AB noted: ""Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by arthropods of the genus _Aedes_."" - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3948>.]
