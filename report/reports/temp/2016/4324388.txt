Korea JoongAng Daily [edited]<http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3020794&cloc=joongangdaily%7Chome%7Cnewslist1>The number of people in Korea infected with malaria jumped by more than 80 percent from 2013 to 2015, with experts suggesting this may be a consequence of terminating the joint antimalarial project between the South and the North.The type of malaria most commonly found in Asia is caused by the parasite _Plasmodium vivax_, which is carried by the female _Anopheles_ mosquito. Symptoms of the disease may include fever, breathing problems, seizures, coma, and possibly death.South and North Korea began the joint project to combat malaria in 2008. Gyeonggi, which is more prone to malaria than other regions due to its proximity to the North [Korea], agreed with the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation to provide the North with equipment such as mosquito nets. The 2 also agreed to take measures to combat malaria every year from June to September, when mosquitoes are most active.The region carried out the project with the Korean Sharing Movement, a Seoul-based nonprofit organization that provides aid to people in the North.Korea had been supporting the World Health Organization's antimalarial project in the North, but the joint project proved far more successful; the number of people infected with malaria in Gyeonggi in 2007 was 1007, whereas after the initiation of the joint project, that number dropped to 490 by 2008, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control.The Gyeonggi Provincial Government continued the joint antimalarial project by investing some 2.1 billion won ($1.79 million) until the end of 2011. As a result, the number of malaria patients in the region fell that year to 382.Despite the sinking of the Cheonan warship in March 2010, the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea in November of that year, and the [24 May 2010] sanctions on the North that followed, the joint project to combat malaria continued until 2012, when support for the project ended. The number of malaria patients since 2012 has been steadily increasing.The number of people infected with malaria in Gyeonggi was down from 257 in 2012 to 228 in 2013, but the following year it was up to 311 and by 2015 it had reached 417, an 82.9 percent increase in just two years.The number of Anopheles mosquitoes in the 12 northwestern parts of Gyeonggi has fallen by about 75 percent from 2012 to 2015. Experts therefore believe that the increase in the number of people with malaria is due to insufficient antimalarial efforts by the North.""The number of mosquitoes transmitting the parasite that causes malaria increased in North Korea due to its lack of antimalarial efforts,"" said an expert who spoke on condition of anonymity, ""and those mosquitoes come down to the South.""The Gyeonggi office and other civil organizations agreed with the Academy of Medical Science in North Korea to resume the joint antimalarial project in 2015, but the plan was overshadowed by the hostile atmosphere between the 2 nations following the North's fourth nuclear test and multiple missile tests since.The late Park Jae-won, professor at Gachon University's [South Korea] medical campus and an expert who used to advise the WHO on malaria issues, once said before he died, ""It's important to manage North Korea to prevent the spread of malaria, and it's crucial to supply the North with the materials it needs to do this.""""Although a proper epidemiologic study hasn't been conducted yet,"" said an official from the Gyeonggi office, ""we believe that ending the joint project has caused the rise in the number of malaria patients.""Lee Young-jae of the Korean Sharing Movement said, ""North and South Korea's joint measure to combat malaria has to begin again as soon as possible.""[Byline: Kim Min-Wook, Shin Soo-Yeon]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Republic of Korea was declared malaria free in 1979. Temperate climate _P. vivax_ malaria (temperate type) emerged in 1993 near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) (Kho WG et al: Border malaria characters of reemerging vivax malaria in the Republic of Korea. Korea J Parasitol 1999; 37(2): 71-6). Several thousand cases were reported annually up to 2007 (Kim HC et al: Malaria in the Republic of Korea, 1993-2007. Variables related to re-emergence and persistence of _Plasmodium vivax_ among Korean populations and US forces in Korea. Mil Med 2009; 174(7): 762-9).Temperate climate _P. vivax_ is characterized by a long incubation time (6 to 8 months) allowing the infection to survive in the host during the winter (White NJ: Determinants of relapse periodicity in _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria. Malaria J 2011; 10:297).North Korea is included in the 2015 WHO World Malaria Report (<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/wmr2015-profiles.pdf>, page 107), but no number of cases are reported; only that 47 percent of the population live in _P. vivax_ risk areas.The present surge of _P. vivax_ in South Korea in the regions bordering North Korea is similar to the emergence in 1993, and strongly indicate that malaria is not under control in North Korea. - Mod.EPMaps of South Korea can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/south-korea/maps/south-korea-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4245>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
