El Nino conditions are predicted to persist through May-June 2016, which could provide the enabling conditions for a 2nd consecutive year of unusually high prevalences for rodent/rabbit associated zoonoses in the western and southwestern United States (<http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/#discussion>).Given the high rates of mortality associated with human infections by the Sin Nombre hantavirus, concerted public awareness campaigns and HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] medical surveillance programs should be instituted immediately to help limit human cases levels during the coming months.References:Pedati, C., House, J., Hancock-Allen, J., Colton, L., Bryan, K., Ortbahn, D., Kightlinger, L., Kugeler, K., Petersen, J., Mead, P. and Safranek, T., 2014.

Dudley, Ph.D.Research ScientistInstitute of Arctic Biology - University of Alaska Fairbanks<jpdudley@alaska.edu>[This comment provides a timely alert for the risk of increased numbers of Sin Nombre hantavirus infections in the near future, especially for people living in the Southwest USA. After severe drought conditions in that part of the country, El Nino recently has brought significant amounts of rain and snow to many drought-affected areas. This will bring about a marked increase in vegetation in the spring and summer and is likely to increase the amount of food available for deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), the rodent reservoir of Sin Nombre virus. Populations of deer mice can be expected to increase, and more infected rodents are likely to enter homes, cabins and other buildings where people can be exposed to virus-contaminated excreta from these rodents. Sin Nombre virus infections can result in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome with a case fatality rate of over 30 percent.
