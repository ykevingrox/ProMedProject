Classified as a primary case with an indirect exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.2- A 49 year old Saudi female from Riyadh, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition. Classified as a primary case with no known exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It appears as though transmission of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia may be picking up this month (June 2016). In May 2016, there were a total of 4 newly confirmed cases reported: 1 from Hufoof, 2 from Riyadh, and 1 from Hail. We are now halfway through the month of June 2016 and there have been 5 newly confirmed cases reported: 2 from Riyadh, 1 each from Tabuk, Alkharj, and Madinah. With the dispersed geographic distribution of these newly confirmed cases, these appear to be sporadic cases and not associated with nosocomial spread. All 5 cases have been classified as primary cases with either direct or indirect camel exposure during the 14 days preceding onset of illness, or an unknown history of contact with camels.So the question that comes up now, will this ""increase"" in case identification continue, or is this just a minor ""blip"" in the reporting information?A map showing the locations of the newly reported cases can be found at the source URL.
