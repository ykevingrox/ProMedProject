The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cases-of-je-on-the-rise-in-rural-malkangiri/article9143924.ece>Instances of small children with symptoms of suspected Japanese encephalitis (JE) have started to emerge from remote rural pockets of Malkangiri district of Odisha.Medical authorities have started precautionary measures to check resurgence of encephalitis in the district again. As per Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) of Malkangiri, Uday Shankar Mishra, till now around 14 children between the age of 2-8 years have been identified to be suffering from symptoms of encephalitis. Some of them are being treated in Malkangiri district hospital and 6 have been referred to MKCG medical college and hospital in Berhampur. All these children had developed symptoms related to encephalitis that includes fever, lethargy and vomiting.This time the suspected encephalitis cases are being reported from Korkunda, Kalimela, Pandripani blocks of the district, the CDMO added. Blood samples of these children have also been sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) for tests to ascertain whether they have been infected by JE [virus] or any other form of encephalitis. Remote pockets of Malkangiri district have history of encephalitis infection, especially among children. In 2012 during monsoon months, several children had died in the district allegedly due to encephalitis. Some suspected cases of the disease were also reported from the district in 2013. In 2014 it was alleged that around 10 children had died in the district because of it.So, as precautionary measure, awareness drive as well as measures to curb mosquito menace has been started in all rural areas of the district. Medical teams are visiting most prone areas. The virus causing JE is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Culex vishnui_ groups, which breed particularly in flooded rice fields. Bodies of pigs are its major breeding points [amplifying hosts]. All these factors are prevalent in rural areas of Malkangiri district. So, there is extra watch on areas where pig population is high.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A 23 Sep 2016 report stated that at least 12 infants have died of Japanese encephalitis, 6 in the past week in Odisha's Malkangiri district.

As many as 123 encephalitis patients are undergoing treatment.

The effect of pharmacists' strike was visible in BRD Medical College as the medicine store remained closed. The attendants were forced to buy medicines from outside.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of encephalitis cases has been increasing from 224 on 4 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160905.4467223) to 254 on 16 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160921.4503861) and now to the 271 mentioned above. The report does not mention if these are confirmed or suspected JE cases, or cases of acute encephalitis syndrome without an identified etiology. Cases of encephalitis are common in Uttar Pradesh state at this time of the year. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in northeastern India and more cases can be expected over the remainder of the transmission season. The Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh state has been an active focus of JE cases annually. The above report does not indicate if the new cases had been tested for JE or had been vaccinated for it previously.The encephalitis picture in north eastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. - Mod.TY]******[3] Official notificationsDate: Wed 21 Sep 2016Source: News 18, Press Trust of India report [edited]<http://www.news18.com/news/india/japanese-encephalitis-declared-as-notifiable-disease-1294450.html>The Centre on Wednesday [21 Sep 2016] declared Japanese encephalitis (JE) as a notifiable disease and asked states to ensure that all health care providers inform local authorities about such cases, a move aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and stopping it from spreading to newer areas.The move of the Union Health Ministry, which issued a notification to this effect on Wednesday, comes after Health Minister J P Nadda had given an assurance to Lok Sabha in August this year [2016] for making JE a notifiable disease.""JE is an important public health concern in the country accounting for substantial morbidity, mortality and disability. Early reporting of JE cases is necessary for effective implementation of preventive measures and case management. In order to ensure early diagnosis and case management, reduce transmission, address the problems of emergency and spread of disease in newer geographical areas, it is essential to have complete information of all JE cases.""Therefore, the health care providers shall notify every JE case to local authorities that is District Health Officer or Chief Medical Officer of the district concerned and Municipal Health Officer of the Municipal Corporation every week (daily during transmission period),"" the notification said.The notification has been sent to the heads of state health departments and other health functionaries of all the states and UTs.Chief secretaries of Assam, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, where the number of JE cases has been reported to be high in the past, have been requested to issue necessary notification.Under the Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 or relevant Act or Rules as applicable, to ensure necessary monitoring, prevention and control of the disease, an official statement said.""During the discussion on a Calling Attention Motion in the Lok Sabha on 11 Aug 2016 regarding spread of JE, especially Eastern Uttar Pradesh and steps taken by the government.""Union Health Minister J P Nadda had made an assurance for making JE a notifiable disease. The notification circular issued today is in response to the said assurance,"" the official statement said. The statement said that for the purpose of this notification, health care providers have been asked to include clinical establishment run or managed by the government private or NGO sectors and even individual practitioners under Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010.""The doctors in Government Health Institutions and the registered medical private practitioners of the private hospitals are required to immediately inform the office of the District Health Authority of concerned district, if a suspected case of JE is reported at their health institution.""The blood samples of all the JE suspected cases have to be sent to the JE Sentinel surveillance Hospital (SSH), to be tested by ELISA technique. The information of the positive case should be sent to the office of the District Health Authority immediately after the diagnosis,"" the notification said.It said that the management of the JE cases needs to be done as per the guidelines issued by the government from time to time and available on the website of Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control programme (NVBDCP).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Previous reports have indicated that private hospitals and clinics, unlike government hospitals, were not required to report JE cases to the Ministry of Health or state health agencies. Now, apparently, they will be required to do so, making JE surveillance much more complete. However, there is no indication if cases of undiagnosed acute encephalitis or suspected JE cases that are never confirmed or ruled out must be reported, or if only confirmed JE cases must be reported, making surveillance less comprehensive. - Mod.TY]******[4] East Singhbhum, Jamshedpur, Jharkhand stateDate: Wed 21 Sep 2016Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]An alert was issued by the East Singhbhum's Civil Surgeon's office for Japanese encephalitis in the city after the Tata Main Hospital reported 4 suspected Japanese encephalitis cases on Monday, 19 Sep 2016.
