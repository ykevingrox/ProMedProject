Telemetro [in Spanish, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/sospechosos-encefalitis-viral-reporta-Minsa_0_933207409.html>The Ministry of Health reported Friday [8 Jul 2016] 3 suspected cases of viral encephalitis, all from the province of Darien [Panama].The cases are 2 children under 15 and an adult aged 36 who were transferred to the Children's Hospital and the Social Security Fund [hospital] (CSS), respectively. The cases are being analyzed by the Gorgas Memorial Institute and Health Studies.It was also reported that in mid-June 2016, animal health of the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) received reports of 4 ill animals testing positive for equine encephalitis, all [also] from Darien province.The ministry was emphatic that the disease is already known in Panama because cases have been registered in previous years, so citizens, especially farm owners and others, are being urged to take precautions for their animals.Equine encephalitis comes from a virus that affects animals. Viral encephalitis [in general] is caused by a viral infection, [acquired through] ingestion of contaminated food, skin contact or from bites of mosquitoes or ticks, which are already infected with the virus.[Byline: Viola Guevara Gallimore]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Whether these cases are caused by eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Madariaga (South American variant of EEE), Venezuelan equine encephalitis VEE) viruses, or by another virus remains to be determined.Sporadic human and equine cases of EEE and VEE have been reported in Darien province in the recent past. Last year (2015), there was a mixed outbreak there involving humans and equine animals. There were 27 human and 5 equine cases of EEE in 2010 and 4 equine cases in 2013, also in Darien province. All of these viruses are transmitted by mosquito vectors. The case fatality rate for humans infected with VEEV is relatively low, less than one percent, whereas it is much higher in individuals with neurological disease from EEEV infections. Children are more severely affected by VEEV infection than adults.If VEE virus is the cause of these cases, it would be of interest to know which subtype is involved, as subtype IAB or IC can cause massive equine epizootics over wide geographic areas with spillover to many humans. Subtype ID usually causes a few sporadic human cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100617.2034). ProMED will be interested in knowing what the laboratory results are when they become available and whether any new human or equine cases occur.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18>.]
