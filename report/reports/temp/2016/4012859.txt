The New Daily [edited]<http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2016/02/11/wa-salmonella-cases-linked-lettuce/>The Western Australia [WA] health department confirmed 2 state-based cases of salmonellosis were not linked to contaminated lettuce, as the suspected number of linked cases rose across the country. A WA Health Department spokeswoman said although the 2 local cases were the same strain of _Salmonella_ linked to lettuce in the eastern states, they were not caused by that product. ""WA Health has advised previously that the lettuce linked to a salmonellosis outbreak in the eastern states is not imported or consigned to WA,"" the spokeswoman said. She said the particular strain is relatively common, with 1 to 2 cases reported in WA each month.Selected pre-packaged lettuce products -- supplied by Victorian-based Tripod Farmers -- linked to a salmonellosis outbreak forced a nationwide recall the week. The number of suspected cases linked to lettuce from Victoria had risen, with 144 reported cases across Australia. The number of likely cases of _S._ Anatum strain had risen to 134 across 5 states, while the number of confirmed cases remained at 10, including 9 in Victoria and 1 in NSW [New South Wales], Victorian health authorities said on Thu 11 Feb 2016. No cases had been reported in the ACT [Australian Capital Territory], Northern Territory, and Tasmania.Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services was still investigating the source of the _S._ Anatum contamination, which had been linked to salad leaf products produced by Tripod Farmers at Bacchus Marsh, west of Melbourne. Tripod Farmers had voluntarily recalled a variety of its products, sold through Coles and Woolworths supermarkets and to the food trade. Coles and Woolworths said this week [week of 8 Jan 2016] they had pulled the affected packaged lettuce from its shelves until further notice and assured The New Daily that any other lettuce products sold in-store were safe to consume.Weight loss company Lite N' Easy was also caught up in the recall, instructing consumers not to eat specific pre-packaged affected lunches that contained lettuce, while 7-Eleven recalled some of its pre-made sandwiches.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases continues to rise as the time approaches the best-before date of 14 Feb 2016. ProMED-mail awaits more data regarding the scope and distribution of the outbreak, which centers on the state of Victoria. - Mod.LLMaps of Australia can be seen at <http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
