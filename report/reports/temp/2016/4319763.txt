WHO Emergencies, Yellow Fever Situation Report [edited]<http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/situation-reports/30-june-2016/en/>A yellow fever outbreak was detected in Luanda, Angola late in December 2015. The 1st cases were confirmed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa on 19 Jan 2016 and by the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IP-D) on 20 Jan 2016. Subsequently, a rapid increase in the number of cases has been observed.Summary-------Angola: 3464 suspected casesIn Angola, as of 24 Jun 2016 a total of 3464 suspected cases have been reported, of which 868 are confirmed. The total number of reported deaths is 353, of which 116 were reported among confirmed cases. Suspected cases have been reported in all 18 provinces and confirmed cases have been reported in 16 provinces and 79 of 125 reporting districts.Mass vaccination campaigns 1st began in Luanda and have now expanded to cover most of the other affected parts of Angola. Recently, the campaigns have focused on border areas. Despite extensive vaccination efforts circulation of the virus persists.Democratic Republic of the Congo: 1307 suspected casesAs of 23 Jun 2016, in the Democratic Republic of The Congo (DRC), the total number of notified suspected cases is 1307, with 68 confirmed cases and 75 reported deaths. Cases have been reported in 22 health zones in 5 provinces. Of the 68 confirmed cases, 59 were imported from Angola, 2 are sylvatic (not related to the outbreak) and 7 are autochthonous.Surveillance efforts have increased and vaccination campaigns in DRC have centred on affected zones in Kinshasa and Kongo Central.The risk of spread2 additional countries have reported confirmed yellow fever cases imported from Angola: Kenya (2 cases) and People's Republic of China (11 cases). These cases highlight the risk of international spread through non-immunised travellers.7 countries (Brazil, Chad, Colombia, Ghana, Guinea, Peru and Uganda) are currently reporting yellow fever outbreaks or sporadic cases not linked to the Angolan outbreak.VaccinationWHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization reviewed existing evidence that demonstrates that using 1/5th of a standard vaccine dose would still provide protection against the disease for at least 12 months and possibly longer. This approach, known as fractional dosing, is under consideration as a short-term measure, in the context of a potential vaccine shortage in emergencies.Risk assessmentThe outbreak in Angola remains of high concern due to:- Persistent local transmission despite the fact that nearly 11 million people have been vaccinated;- Local transmission has been reported in 12 highly populated provinces including Luanda.- The continued extension of the outbreak to new provinces and new districts.- High risk of spread to neighbouring countries. As the borders are porous with substantial cross border social and economic activities, further transmission cannot be excluded. Viraemic travelling patients pose a risk for the establishment of local transmission especially in countries where adequate vectors and susceptible human populations are present;- Risk of establishment of local transmission in other provinces where no autochthonous cases are reported;- High index of suspicion of ongoing transmission in hard-to-reach areas like Cabinda.Enhanced surveillance is needed and further strengthening of surveillance is underway.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of suspected cases in the DRC continues to grow. It will be of considerable interest to know how many of these cases are confirmed, their locations, and if they are imported from Angola or locally acquired. Interestingly, no mention is made about vaccine shortages or the number of doses available currently for application in Angola and the DRC.The entire report is not given here.

Dr Musisi noted that a turn-up of 93.3 per cent was realised which, according to him, is a great achievement.He added that following the exercise which was even extended to schools in the area, the district has not registered any new infections. ""We are convinced the district is safe from the virus having vaccinated majority of the population,"" he said.Dr Musisi cautioned the public to continue taking precautionary measures to avoid being exposed to the disease.[Byline: Martins E. Ssekweyama]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Coverage of 93 percent of the population in the affected area in a short period of time is remarkable. Apparently, there was sufficient vaccine available to accomplish that, and sufficient teams to deliver it. One hopes that this outbreak is truly over. Since the outbreak was spill-over from a sylvan transmission cycle, the virus is doubtless still present in the area, so ongoing surveillance is important to quickly detect any new cases from that source. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18593>.]
