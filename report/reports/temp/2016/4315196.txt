He tested positive for MERS-CoV on RT-PCR (UpE and Orf1a) at the Hamad Medical Corporation virology laboratories on 9 Jun 2016, at which time he was immediately transferred from the Shahaniya Health center to the Hamad Medical Corporation by Emergency Medical Services, where he was kept under full isolation. He did not have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. He does have a history of frequent contact with camels and consuming their raw milk. He also has history of travel to Saudi Arabia with his camels, having arrived back in Doha on 28 May 2016. He is currently in stable condition.All contacts were identified and monitored for 14 days following their last date of exposure to the case. None of the contacts developed symptoms.--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project Member[We are very grateful to our EpiCore members for helping to provide additional information and follow-up on reported cases and outcomes of epidemiologic investigations and control measures. Following the 1st publication of the confirmation of MERS-CoV in this case, another EpiCore Surveillance Project Member provided additional epidemiologic information suggesting the possibility that transmission may have occurred in Saudi Arabia (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV (62): Qatar ex Saudi Arabia, additional details 20160614.4287582). Using the Saudi classification, this case would be classified as a primary case with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Fortunately, there were no secondary cases associated with this case.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Qatar, can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/130>. - Mod.MPP]
