""We then concluded that it is much more rubella than measles,"" he said, adding that Togo has no available vaccine against the disease.Agbeko said the rubella is benign, and the ministry is gearing to integrate its vaccine in child routine immunization campaigns in the West African country.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Togo can be accessed at <http://www.izf.net/pages/togo/3500/> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/64>. - Mod.LM]******[2] Sudan (Abyei Area)Date: Mon 15 Feb 2016Source: Radio Tamazuj [edited]<https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/doctor-says-measles-outbreak-abyei-worsening>The number of suspected measles cases has reached at least 40 at Abyei Hospital in the contested territory between Sudan and South Sudan, a senior health official said.Yusuf Lal Ayom, the Director of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in the Abyei Area Administration, told Radio Tamazuj that about 40 suspected measles cases among children were recorded at Abyei Hospital recently.Ayok pointed out that a vaccination campaign against the disease started over the weekend in Abyei in an attempt to reduce the number of suspected cases.The EPI director added that a joint team from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF is vaccinating children in the area. The campaign targets 35 000 children from birth to 15 years old. He explained that the program will end [Wed 17 Feb 2016].Last week [Feb 2016], Lal Ayom said that about 28 measles cases among children were recorded at Abyei Hospital.

Passengers on this flight may have been exposed to measles as a passenger was ill with symptoms.Laboratory results confirmed the illness as measles on [26 Jan 2016] and it is likely the passenger acquired measles while travelling in SE Asia.This alert is being issued as those on the same flight as well as those in proximity to the case who travelled through these 2 airports may have been exposed.""Some potentially exposed passengers may have been traveling to other destinations including within Canada. The likelihood of transmission is deemed small, as the case developed cough, and subsequently rash, only after arriving in Vancouver,"" said the BC Centre of Disease Control in a statement.While it is expected that the majority of travellers will be immune to measles, this advisory is being posted in the event that additional cases of measles with an exposure history compatible with this case come to light in the coming weeks or may become aware of this exposure and seek post exposure advice.[Byline: Anita Sthankiya]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Canada can be accessed at <https://canadaalive.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/canada_political_map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12>. - Mod.LM]******[4] Canada (Calgary)Date: Thu 28 Jan 2016Source: 660 News [edited]<http://www.660news.com/2016/01/28/ahs-issues-public-alert-of-potential-measles-exposures/>Alberta Health Services [AHA] officials have issued a public alert after an individual with a confirmed case of measles visited the city while infected.In the middle of January [2016], a person with the illness made several stops in the city, prompting AHS to put out the warning.The person was in Calgary from [15-18 Jan 2016] and anyone who was at one of the following locations during the times specified could have been exposed to the disease.[15-18 Jan 2016]Waterfront Condos222 Riverfront Avenue SW, Calgary12 am, 15 Jan 2016 -- 10 am, 18 Jan 2016[15 Jan 2016]Forbidden City Dim Sum & Seafood999 36 St NE, Calgary6 pm - 10:30 pm[18 Jan 2016]Calgary International Airport10 am - 1:30 pmWestJet Flight WS287Calgary to VancouverFlight duration (departed Calgary at 11:35 am)Anyone who may have been at any of the following locations during the times specified should monitor symptoms, which include fever, cough, runny nose, and a red blotchy rash that can appear a few days after a fever.AHS is asking anyone who experiences these symptoms to contact Health Link at 8-1-1 instead of heading to health clinics or hospitals.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] Cambodia (Kampong Speu)Date: Thu 28 Jan 2016Source: The Phnom Penh Post [edited]<http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/measles-diagnosis-emerges-kampong-speu>Just under a year since Cambodia was declared measles-free by the World Health Organization, a 7-month-old baby from Kampong Speu province has been diagnosed with the disease and is receiving treatment in the capital, the Ministry of Health said yesterday [27 Jan 2016].While the origin of the case remains unknown, Ork Vichit, manager of Cambodia's National Immunization Program, speculated that it could have been a rare case emerging from a rural area that had not received proper vaccinations or may have migrated from a neighbouring country where the disease has not been eradicated.""The clue is that the mother had travelled a lot. But I cannot say to which country. The countries around us have hundreds of measles cases every year,"" said Vichit.He added that the Ministry of Health has sent out 2 teams -- one to investigate the child's living environment and vaccination regimen in Kong Pisei district, and another to facilities where the child was treated to determine if she came into contact with other children.While cases of measles among children younger than 9 months are rare, they're far from impossible, said WHO Cambodia representative Dr Shafiqul Hossain.""In developing countries like Cambodia and Laos, a mother may be malnourished and not have [the correct levels of] antibodies. Children born to such mothers can suffer from measles as early as 6 months of life,"" he said.However, there are no plans to lower the vaccination age, which is currently not allowed for babies younger than 9 months as they still retain antibodies from their mothers at that age.[Byline: Niem Chheng]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Cambodia can be seen at <http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Cambodia,_administrative_divisions_-_de_-_colored.svg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/26110>. - Mod.LM]******[6] France (Calais refugee camp)Date: Fri 12 Feb 2016Source: Nord Littoral [in French trans., edited]<http://www.nordlittoral.fr/calais/calais-plusieurs-cas-de-rougeole-detectes-dans-la-jungle-ia0b0n283295>MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres] and the Regional Health Agency found several cases of measles in the Jungle [nickname given to a refugee/migrant camp], Calais, northern France.Last week [week of 1 Feb 2016], the Regional Health Agency (ARS) has documented several cases of measles in the Jungle in Calais.

It takes 10 days after contact with an infected person to show symptoms of measles, and today marks that deadline.If the patient tests positive, it'll be the 1st connected case to the Sky City incident. According to Dr Hoskins, if that is the case, the ARPHS will take a normal public health response -- isolating the person while they are still contagious, tracing contacts, and getting those susceptible into quarantine.Yesterday [17 Feb 2016], Dr Hoskins said the infected man had been told to go into quarantine but ignored the instruction. He says health authorities had no idea the man wouldn't comply and by the time they realised, it was too late.People who are feeling unwell and were at SkyCity Casino and Sugar Tree Apartments should seek medical attention immediately.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
