El Nuevo Herald, The Associated Press (AP) report [in Spanish, trans. Mod.LK, edited]<http://www.elnuevoherald.com/vivir-mejor/salud/article122039909.html>According to health officials, an epidemic of mumps is seriously affecting a community of citizens of the Marshall Islands residents of northwest Arkansas.Citizens of the Marshall Islands represent approximately 60 percent of the 2220 cases of mumps reported in the state through [Fri 23 Dec 2016]. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper reported that the outbreak began in August 2016 (<http://bit.ly/2hVVQYf>).Nate Smith, director of the State Health Department, said he doesn't know why so many people from the Marshall Islands are infected. Officials are investigating whether the vaccine is less effective for certain people. Smith said that the people of the Marshall Islands tend to live close to each other.""It's a bit like a college dormitory in terms of intensity of exposure,"" he explained. Smith added that citizens of the Marshall Islands are involved in many community oriented events, where it is easy for transmission of infections.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the epidemic in Arkansas is the largest since 2009 and 2010 when approximately 3000 people were infected in New York. Smith said that cases of mumps in Arkansas represent more than half of those reported this year [2016] at the national level.The Department of Health had vaccinated almost 6600 people up to [Fri 23 Dec 2016]. Smith said that the efforts are showing results because only 12 cases were reported during the last 3 days of last week [week of 12 Dec 2016], ""which is really much less than we had for months.""The Marshall Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, more than 3200 kilometers (2000 miles) southwest of Hawaii. About 12 000 of its citizens live in Northwest Arkansas.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[Mumps is a viral illness transmitted by the respiratory route, making dissemination possible in gatherings of people. The report does not specify the vaccination coverage of these citizens of the Marshall Islands who have developed the disease, which could be another factor contributing to this outbreak, apart from the possibility of lower effectiveness of the vaccine. It is necessary to investigate further in order to establish with certainty this behavior of the disease. - Mod.JGSee ProMED-mail Mumps - USA (21) 20161008.4545923 for reports of cases in other states in the United States -- Oklahoma and Washington -- and a discussion of the particular problem of providing protection to the Marshallese in Arkansas against vaccine-preventable diseases.A map showing the location of Arkansas in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208> - Mod.

DSHS said it has identified 11 mumps cases associated with this outbreak.A 2nd outbreak is being investigated in Johnson County, south of Fort Worth. Health officials have identified 72 cases in this outbreak, including 71 Johnson County residents and 1 Tarrant County resident. DSHS is working with school districts in the area to limit its spread since most of the cases are in students.Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can also be spread by sharing cups and utensils.Symptoms include swollen or tender salivary glands, low fever, tiredness and muscle aches. Men can also exhibit swollen or tender testicles.DSHS said people who are vaccinated can also contract the virus. The spread of mumps can be prevented or limited by covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and not sharing food or drinks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the location of Texas in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.

At the moment, health agencies state that at least one case of an individual displaying mumps symptoms has been confirmed, says the Kansas City Health Department. As a consequence, an advisory has been issued on Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2016].Rex Archer, head of the Kansas City Health Department urges people who contracted the disease to stay inside, in order to contain the outbreak, via an official statement. In his plea, Mr Archer asks people to take several days off from either school or work-related duties for at least 5 days after the 1st symptoms emerge, such as the inflammation of the salivary glands. Rex Archer also says that individuals who came in contact with infected people could start displaying mumps symptoms anywhere in between 12 to 25 days after exposure to the virus. Ultimately, he recommends people who develop mumps symptoms to address their health care provider as soon as soon as possible. ""Questions about your immunity or vaccination status should be directed to your private physician"", says Rex Archer.As of now, roughly 200 cases of infected individuals have been confirmed by the University of Missouri in Columbia. In order to contain the outbreak, Kansas City Health Department officials say that they are closely monitoring the progression of the local case. Not only this, but health officials also give out several tips that could prevent other individuals from contracting the disease.Doctors strongly recommend citizens to thoroughly wash their hands as often as possible, covering their mouths with anything other than their hands when sneezing, like tissues or elbow, and avoiding sharing spoons, forks, knives, or other eating utensils with infected subjects. Ultimately, the Health Department representatives also believe that one of the best ways for the population to stay mumps-free is by disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, counters, tables, and handles.[Byline: John Birks]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4145>. - Mod.LK]
