Antibody mediated epitope mimicry in the pathogenesis of Zika virus related disease.""Abstract""The association of Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome with Zika virus infection raises suspicion of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of Zika associated disease. Using computational analysis to identify predicted B and T cell epitopes, we assessed whether antibodies elicited by B cell epitopes in Zika virus may also target B cell epitopes in the human proteome. We detected amino acid motifs predicted to be B cell epitopes in Zika virus proteins which are also present in human proteins, including pro-neuropeptide Y (proNPY), NAV2 and other proteins with interacting neurophysiologic function. We examine the predicted MHC binding of peptides likely to provide T cell help to the potential mimic epitopes. Some potential mimic epitopes in Zika virus envelope have apparently strong T cell help, likely facilitating immunoglobulin class switch. We also identify epitope mimic commonalities with dengue serotypes 1 and 3. We hypothesize that antibodies to Zika virus epitopes may contribute to the pathogenesis of Zika-associated Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome, microcephaly, and ocular lesions, and may be a driver of autoimmunity. The risk associated with responses to potential epitope mimics must be addressed in the development of vaccines and therapeutics for Zika virus infections.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is going to be important to determine if autoimmunity does, in fact, play an important role in the pathogenesis of Zika virus infection of the fetus (microcephaly and eye lesions) and of adults (Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome). As this report notes, should autoimmunity be a factor in pathogenesis, it may complicate the development and application of Zika virus vaccines. - Mod.TY]******[3] Diagnostic testDate: Fri 18 Mar 2016Source: USA CDC [edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0318-zika-lab-test.html>In response to a request from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday [17 Mar 2016] issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Trioplex Real-time RT-PCR Assay, a diagnostic tool for Zika virus that will be distributed to qualified laboratories. The assay allows doctors to tell whether an individual is currently infected with chikungunya, dengue, or Zika using one test, instead of having to perform 3 separate tests to determine which infection one might have.This EUA will potentially allow CDC to more rapidly perform testing to detect acute Zika virus infection. As with any test, it is important that health care providers consult with their patients about test results and the best approach to monitoring their health.CDC will begin distributing the test during the next 2 weeks to qualified laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network, an integrated network of domestic and international laboratories that respond to public health emergencies. The test will not be available in US hospitals or other primary care settings.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Qualified domestic and international laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network will be eligible to use this diagnostic tool. This is a major advance in the ability to differentiate Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus infections quickly, which are difficult to diagnose specifically on a clinical basis. However, this test will not be available to hospitals and primary care centers. Interestingly, several participants in the recent WHO multidisciplinary meeting indicated that a point-of-care diagnostic test was needed urgently (<http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(16)30012-5.pdf>). One hopes that diagnostic tools will become available at that level of care soon. - Mod.TY]******[4] Zika virus mosquito vectorsDate: Thu 17 Mar 2016Source: The Lancet Infectious Diseases DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)00176-6> [summ., edited]<http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(16)00176-6/fulltext>Lauren M Gardner, Nan Chen, Sahotra Sarkar. Global risk of Zika virus depends critically on vector status of _Aedes albopictus_.""ConstÌ¢ncia FJ Ayres recently pointed out that Zika virus has been collected from several mosquito species including those from the genera, _Anopheles_, _Culex_, and _Mansonia_ besides _Aedes_. Moreover, at least 10 _Aedes_ species are known to harbour Zika virus. However, the presence of the virus does not automatically make the species an efficient vector for the disease. It is, therefore, unfortunate that a recent risk map published in The Lancet considers _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ together. On the same basis, WHO has predicted that the virus will establish itself in all countries in the Americas except Canada and Chile. However, while the vectorial competence of _A. aegypti_ is well established, that of _A. albopictus_ is not. Although there is evidence of the potential role of _A. albopictus_, there is no quantitative estimate of its efficiency. It is, therefore, useful to conduct a risk analysis that considers 2 cases: spread driven by _A. aegypti_ presence alone and by both species.""In the context of dengue we have previously modelled the habitat suitability for both species globally and integrated the results with air transport data. We quantified the relative risk of Zika virus spread from infected travellers arriving at airports in new regions by aggregating incoming air travel from infected areas with vector habitat suitability at the destination.""The following inferences can be drawn from the resulting relative risk map (figure [available at the above URL]). 1st, if _A. aegypti_ is the only competent Zika virus vector, then risk is geographically restricted in North America to Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. 2nd, if _A. albopictus_ is a competent vector, then there is risk of autochthonous transmission cycles in Canada, Chile, much of western Europe, as well as south and east Asia. 3rd, for all these areas, the risk compounds that from flights originating in other areas historically endemic for Zika virus.""These results underscore Ayres' point that the vector competence of the various potential mosquito species should be a matter of immediate quantitative assessment.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall[These authors make an extremely important point: until there is documentation of the vector competence of western hemisphere strains of _Ae. albopictus_ for transmission of Zika virus isolates from the Americas, it should not be assumed automatically that these mosquitoes are epidemiologically significant or predictive of geographic areas of risk. Experiments to determine the vector efficiency of _Ae. albopictus_ are needed urgently. - Mod.TY]
