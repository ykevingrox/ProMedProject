Test results received today, 23 Apr 2016, from the Washington State Department of Health were negative.Plague occurs naturally in the western USA; the last case in Washington State was in 1984. The plague bacterium (_Yersinia pestis_) is transmitted by fleas and cycles naturally among wild rodents. Plague can also infect humans and their pets. Plague can be treated successfully with antimicrobials, but an infected person must be treated promptly.[byline: Kristi Paulus]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although there are no details regarding this case, if it were seemingly a zoonotic pneumonia with Gram negative bacilli, then _Francisella tularensis_ also needs to be considered. Tularemia pneumonia can also be fatal but, unlike pneumonic plague, does not* spread from person to person. - Mod.LLProMED-mail would be pleased to hear of the definitive diagnosis, when it is made. - Mod.SH*The word ""not"" was unfortunately omitted from the original posting. - Mod.SHA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>.]
