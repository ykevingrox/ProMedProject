A 78-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Taif, who is currently in stable condition. He is classified as a primary case with a history of direct contact with camels.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is now the 9th newly confirmed case reported from Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2016; 8 out of the 9 cases gave a history of contact with camels (direct or indirect -- see WHO update below) in the 14 days prior to onset of their illness (this current case as well). It appears as though nosocomial transmission has not been identified in Saudi Arabia since 16 Dec 2016 (see prior postings). Of concern is the source of infection in the case reported in Riyadh on 1 Feb 2016, where preliminary reports ruled out direct contact with camels. The most recent prior case reported in Riyadh was on 1 Dec 2015 (see prior reports).The location of Taif can be seen on the map available at the source URL above. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia, WHO updateDate: Tue 2 Feb 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2-february-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia [2 Feb 2016]----------------------------------------------------------------------Between [22 and 27 Jan 2016], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 5 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.Details of the cases1.
