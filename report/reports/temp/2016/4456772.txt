CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/08/who-yellow-fever-not-public-health-emergency>Today [31 Aug 2016] the World Health Organization (WHO) held its 2nd emergency committee meeting on yellow fever under the International Health Regulations and said the current outbreak in West Africa still does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).""We agree that this continues to be serious and requires sustained control measures,"" said Professor Oyewale Tomori, the chair of the emergency committee, in a teleconference held in Geneva today [31 Aug 2016].Tomori, along with Dr Peter Salama, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, gave a brief summary of the meeting's findings, which included updates on the status of yellow fever in Angola, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).Vaccine targets met in Kinshasa-------------------------------""Immunization has been at the forefront of response,"" said Salama. ""And using fractioned doses [1/5 the normal dose] we reached a targeted population in Kinshasa in the last 10 days."" Salama said 7.7 million people in Kinshasa, DRC, were vaccinated against yellow fever using one fifth of the standard dose in a campaign that began on [18 Aug 2016]. The diluted dose should confer immunity for at least 1 year [the dose is not diluted; a smaller volume is given - Mod.TY]In addition to meeting the vaccine target in Kinshasa, Tomori and Salama said the global stockpile of yellow fever vaccine was currently at 6 million doses, and WHO expected that number to increase to 20 million doses by December [2016]. Since the yellow fever outbreak began in Luanda, Angola, in January [2016], the global stockpile of the vaccine has twice been depleted.Tomori said there were approximately 6000 cases of suspected yellow fever to date, with Angola reporting its latest new case on [23 Jun 2016] and the DRC on [12 Jul 2016]. After one month of no new transmissions, Tomori explained, the outbreak can be considered over, but suspected cases in neighboring countries, including the Republic of the Congo, means the organisation still considers the outbreak as ongoing. ""We are not out of the woods yet,"" said Tomori.The committee first met on [19 May 2016]. At that time, WHO decided the yellow fever outbreak was a ""serious public health event that warrants intensified national action and enhanced international support.""[byline: Stephanie Soucheray]--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall[Vaccination of 7.7 million Kinshasa residents since 18 Aug 2016 is a major achievement. No additional cases in Angola since 23 Jun 2016 and the DR Congo since 12 Jul 2016 is good news indeed. However, as Dr Tomori cautioned, this is not the time to lower the guard on intensive surveillance in the region. The situation in the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) is unclear. The rainy season is beginning and that will make intensive surveillance in the area more difficult, especially in more remote areas when access becomes more difficult. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>]
