Bent County Democrat [edited] <http://www.bcdemocratonline.com/article/20160104/NEWS/151229895>Prowers County Public Health officials have received lab confirmation of pertussis in 2 Prowers County children, an 8-week old infant, and a 2 year old child, over the past 2 weeks.Due to the outbreak, Prowers County Public Health and Environment is advising parents to check their child's immunization record to ensure they are up to date with their vaccinations for pertussis. All adults are also advised to obtain the vaccination if they have not had the vaccination. Residents are advised to check with their health care provider or call the health department if they are uncertain about their vaccination status.Prowers County Public Health and Environment will be offering clinic times to ensure that residents, including children and adults, who need vaccination can make an appointment to come in. These clinics are an ongoing effort to prevent the further spread of pertussis in Prowers County and possible spread to other counties and states. Children will not be denied due to inability to pay.""Vaccination is the safest and most effective tool against pertussis,"" said Director of Public Health, Tammie Clark, RN, BSN. ""We are continuing to work with the healthcare providers and the community, to prevent the further spread of pertussis. Our work focuses on increasing vaccination rates, particularly in adults and adolescents, and preventing transmission to vulnerable populations, where the disease can have devastating results, such as pregnant women, infants, and those with weakened immune systems.""Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease that is also known as whooping cough, or the ""100-day cough."" It is highly contagious and caused by a bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. People with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of pertussis should stay home from work, school, or childcare until they have been on antimicrobials for at least 5 days.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not stated if the mother of the 8-week-old infant diagnosed with pertussis had received pertussis immunization during the 2nd or 3rd trimester, which will dramatically decrease the incidence of this infection in such young infants, who represent the most vulnerable age group for morbidity and mortality.Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different, with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures, usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis (particularly with white blood cell counts of 30 000 to 100 000) and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality.In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented [a larger proportion of] the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.A 2014 publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes.

""There will be an immediate effect."" Under the law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in July 2015, all children will have to be vaccinated against a variety of infectious diseases before they enter school or day care, unless they have a medical exemption signed by a licensed physician. Children with personal-belief exemptions on file prior to 1 Jan 2016, will be able to stay in school, but will have to meet the requirements of the new law before advancing from preschool to elementary school (grades K-6) or from elementary school to secondary school (grades 7-12). All new students would be subject to the new law after 1 Jul 2016.SB 277 applies to public and private schools, including elementary and secondary schools, day-care centers and nursery schools.Countywide, private schools tended to have higher personal-belief exemption rates than public schools, and it was in those schools with high exemption rates where outbreaks of infectious diseases like pertussis were most likely to occur, Chapman said.Statewide, infants under the age of 1 and teens between the ages of 14 and 17 had the highest pertussis rates in 2015. Among residents of all ages, only Humboldt County had a higher incident rate than Yolo County. As of the end of November 2015, Yolo had documented 80 pertussis cases, for an incident rate of 38.8 per 100 000 residents. ""It's bad,"" Chapman noted.The reason why is not clear, he said, but Yolo is among a cluster of Northern California counties, the others being Marin, Sonoma and Napa, where pertussis rates have been higher than the rest of the state for the past 2 years. ""There seems to be a geographic area with higher rates,"" Chapman said, ""but it's not totally clear why. I don't have an explanation.""The good news is that cases of pertussis in Yolo County decreased from 147 in 2014 to 80 by the end of November 2015. However, given that the county historically had fewer than 5 cases annually, ""the rate is still high,"" Chapman said. He expects the new state law not only will reduce the number of pertussis cases being seen locally but also other childhood infectious diseases like measles and chicken pox, and that's good news for those most vulnerable to infectious disease.Newborns, for example, cannot receive their 1st pertussis vaccine until they are 6 weeks old and remain particularly vulnerable to infection. Of the 176 pertussis cases that resulted in hospitalization in California in 2015, 70 percent (120) were infants under the age of 4 months.[Byline: Anne Ternus-Bellamy]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[State laws such as the new California law can go a long way in decreasing the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases ONLY if physicians do not sign medical exemptions on request of parents for children who truly do not have a real medical reason for the exemption.

Students at the high school and Edison Intermediate/Larson Middle School have been impacted. There have been no cases reported at Stevenson Elementary School.""It's an outbreak, not an epidemic,"" school nurse Mary Mauro said. ""I do think it's interesting that we haven't had a case at the elementary school,"" she said. ""Usually that is where you might expect to see it."" In a typical year, few if any cases are reported, Mauro said.The cases have been spread throughout grade levels at the high school, with 2 seniors, 4 juniors, 3 sophomores and a freshman diagnosed.At Edison/Larson, 7 8th-graders and 4 4th-grade students have come down with whooping cough.The outbreak of the disease is not unique to Grandview, Superintendent Andy Culp said. ""We're just representative of what is happening statewide,"" he said.Pertussis is highly contagious and spread through the air by coughing and sneezing, Mauro said. The 1st case in Grandview was diagnosed in September 2015, Mauro added. ""It's 1 or maybe 2 or 3 cases identified in a week, then a couple weeks go by before we see another case,"" she said.Parents should make sure their children are up to date on immunizations, Mauro said. But the immunity from vaccinations decreases over time, and most of the Grandview students diagnosed with pertussis were up to date in their vaccines, she said.[Byline: Alan Froman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The evolution of new clones of _B. pertussis_, which are less prevented by the current acellular vaccine, and the presence of an underimmunized cohort of individuals may play a role in the number of cases described here. It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ that can infect infants less than 1 year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, who are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis was associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least 1 dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all-acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.References----------1.
