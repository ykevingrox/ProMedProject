In a statement, the health services said there was no cause for alarm. They said the case came to their attention about 5 weeks ago. The patient is currently recovering. The infected man had recently traveled to a country where a number of West Nile cases have been recorded.The origin of the infection is being further investigated in cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the statement said.A mosquito-transmitted virus causes most cases of West Nile infection. Most people infected with West Nile virus either don't develop signs or symptoms or have only minor ones, such as fever and mild headache. However, some people develop a life-threatening illness that includes inflammation of the spinal cord or brain.Mild signs and symptoms of a West Nile virus infection generally go away on their own. But severe signs and symptoms -- such as a severe headache, fever, disorientation, or sudden weakness -- require immediate attention.[byline: Elias Hazou]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the _Flavivirus_ genus and is endemic in parts of Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and West Asia. WNV is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes belonging to numerous _Aedes_, _Culex_, _Anopheles_ and other species <https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/resources/pdfs/mosquitospecies1999-2012.pdf>.Infection with WNV is either asymptomatic (no symptoms) in around 80 per cent of infected people, or can lead to West Nile fever or severe West Nile disease. About 20 per cent of people who become infected with WNV will develop West Nile fever. Symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, and body aches, nausea, vomiting, occasionally with a skin rash (on the trunk of the body) and swollen lymph glands.The symptoms of severe disease (also called neuroinvasive disease, such as West Nile encephalitis or meningitis or West Nile poliomyelitis) include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. It is estimated that approximately one in 150 persons infected with the West Nile virus will develop a more severe form of disease.According to the report above, this is the 1st confirmed case of WNV infection from Cyprus and is related to travel to an endemic region. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/82>.]
