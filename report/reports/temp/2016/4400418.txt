We're told a family in who lives on Metztown Road in Brady Township took their unvaccinated farm cat to a veterinary clinic after they say it started to act restless and panting. The veterinarian told them to keep the cat contained, but the next day, the cat escaped the enclosure they had it in and bit a child.At that point, the cat was euthanized and submitted for rabies tests. They came back positive. Several people are receiving post exposure treatment for rabies.Pennsylvania law requires all dogs and non-feral cats 3 months of age and older to be vaccinated against rabies. Booster vaccinations must be administered periodically to maintain lifelong immunity. Failure to comply with the law may result in a fine of up to USD 300.If you encounter an animal that you suspect may have rabies, contact your local law enforcement or local Pennsylvania Game Commission office. Your regional Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture office can provide guidance for safely preparing and submitting the animal for rabies testing. If you may have been exposed to the rabies virus, seek medical attention.For more information, visit <http://www.agriculture.pa.gov> and search ""rabies.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Rabies - PennsylvaniaDate: 5 Aug 2016Source: Patch.com [edited]<http://patch.com/pennsylvania/doylestown/groundhog-had-aggressive-encounters-doylestown-tests-positive-rabies>A groundhog captured in Doylestown after ""a series of aggressive encounters"" has tested positive for rabies, Doylestown Borough officials confirmed Friday [5 Aug 2016].
