The Indian Express [edited]<http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/congo-fever-case-reported-from-amc-hospital/>A fresh case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF], commonly known as Congo fever, has been reported from AMC [Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]-run VS Hospital. The civic body's health department officials so far have reported 3-4 cases of the CCHF virus infection this year [2016].A 26-year-old farmer from Dhandhuka [Ahmedabad district, state of Gujarat] was admitted to VS Hospital on [12 Mar 2016] with complaints of fever, headache and myalgia for the last one month. Later, his blood samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.According to the NIV report, he was tested positive for CCHF infection. The farmer had been infected by the virus in the past too.""His all major organs are functioning normal and the blood platelets count has also increased from 20 000 at the time he was admitted to 55 400,"" said AMC medical officer Dr Bhavin Solanki.The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.According to WHO, CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and other parts of Asia. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 3rd CCHF case in Gujarat state that ProMED-mail has posted so far this year (2016). There are previous reports of cases in Gujarat from the Kutch district in 2015. It is clear that CCHF virus is fairly widespread in India. The circumstances under which the farmer acquired his CCHF virus infection are not stated. Not only does transmission occur from contact with blood and tissues of CCHF virus-infected animals and ticks, but with blood and secretions of infected individual people as well, usually in a hospital setting.It is doubtful that the farmer had CCHF previously and that this is the 2nd time he has been infected with the virus. The 1st infection should provide life-long immunity. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The tick control efforts mentioned above should help prevent additional CCHF virus transmission among cattle and to humans in that locality. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state, ""Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was initially characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.""The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin, and it has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients, reportedly with some benefit (<http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/>). However, since the patient died so soon after admission, effective use of the drug in the treatment of the case above would not have been possible.A map of the states and territories of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>, and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52429>. - Mod.TY]
