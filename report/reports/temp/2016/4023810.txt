ABC News [edited]<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-08/zika-link-questioned-microcephaly-cause-brazilian-survey/7147602>A 4 year survey of more than 100 000 newborn babies in north eastern Brazil has uncovered hitherto unrecognised patterns of microcephaly. The discovery suggests microcephaly is not necessarily a new phenomenon and questions whether Zika virus is even the cause. Zika virus has been occupying the global media for weeks now, prompted by what appears to be a huge spike in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads.The scramble in Brazil to discover the cause led paediatric cardiologist Dr Sandra Mattos to realise she was sitting on a database which could provide some answers. Over 4 years, she and her colleagues surveyed more than 100 000 newborns for congenital heart disease in the Brazilian state of Paraiba. But, importantly, in just over 16 000 of these babies, the nurses also collected other information, such as length, weight, and head circumference -- the indictor for microcephaly. ""We tried to establish the pattern of microcephaly over the last 4 years,"" Dr Mattos said.Dr Mattos and her colleagues were surprised by the numbers. ""What we expected was that we would have something like 3-4 cases a year of microcephaly; that is what has been documented in the official sites. But we then noticed that we had much, much higher numbers."" As part of the survey, Dr Mattos' team assessed head size in 3 ways to ensure it was as accurate as possible. ""Independent of what criteria we used, we had between 2-8 per cent of babies that would fall into the criteria of microcephaly,"" she said. This represents between 2000 and 4000 babies per year in the state of Paraiba, about 1000 times more than the team expected.The survey goes back to 2012 and 2013 and shows a spike each spring and summer, and while the headlines are all recent, the biggest peak in north eastern Brazil was actually in 2014. But Dr Mattos said there was something different and potentially very worrying about the 2015 spring-summer spike in microcephaly, relating to how small the babies' heads were. ""In the most severe cases of microcephaly, that group which are the very severe cases, they are definitely increasing from the last part of 2015,"" she said.International publicity about microcephaly has focused on babies with small heads, but it is unusual for microcephaly to present by itself. It is usually part of a syndrome where there are heart defects, limb defects or other congenital defects. Dr Mattos said these cases of microcephaly were not coupled with a rise in heart defects in the same babies. ""That's what's really unusual about this outbreak,"" she said. ""Most of the microcephaly cases that are being reported now are primarily very severe microcephaly without anything else.""The survey calls into question whether these microcephaly cases are caused by Zika virus or something else. If it is Zika virus, it has been in Brazil for a lot longer than people have thought, but that does not explain why after 50 years Zika has only now been linked to microcephaly.[byline: Norman Swan]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>andRoland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[The debate over the role of Zika virus infections in incidence of microcephaly will likely continue for some time. There is increasing evidence that Zika virus infections can have teratogenic effects. However, since microcephaly can be due to a variety of causes, sorting out the proportion due to Zika virus infections and to other causes will be difficult.Maps of Brazil showing the location of the state mentioned can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/brazil.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Microcephaly Slovenia ex BrazilDate: Wed 10 Feb 2016Source: New England Journal of Medicine DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa160065 [edited]<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1600651#t=article>Jernej Mlakar, Misa Korva, Nata Tul, Mara Popova, Mateja Polj Aak-Prijatelj, Jerica Mraz, et al. Zika virus associated with microcephaly.""We present a case of vertical transmission of ZIKV in a woman who was probably infected with ZIKV in northeastern Brazil at the end of the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Our discussion includes details of fetal imaging and pathological and virologic analyses.""In mid-October 2015, a 25-year-old previously healthy European woman came to the Department of Perinatology at the University Medical Center in Ljubljana, Slovenia because of assumed fetal anomalies. Since December 2013, she had lived and worked as a volunteer in Natal, the capital of Rio Grande do Norte state. She had become pregnant at the end of February 2015. During the 13th week of gestation, she had become ill with high fever, which was followed by severe musculoskeletal and retroocular pain and an itching, generalized maculopapular rash. Since there was a ZIKV epidemic in the community, infection with the virus was suspected, but no virologic diagnostic testing was performed. Ultrasonography that was performed at 14 and 20 weeks of gestation showed normal fetal growth and anatomy.""The patient returned to Europe at 28 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonography that was performed at 32 weeks of gestation confirmed intrauterine growth retardation (estimated 3rd percentile of fetal weight) with normal amniotic fluid, a placenta measuring 3.5 cm in thickness (normal size) with numerous calcifications, a head circumference below the 2nd percentile for gestation (microcephaly), moderate ventriculomegaly, and a transcerebellar diameter below the 2nd percentile. Brain structures were blurred, and there were numerous calcifications in various parts of the brain.""Medical termination of the pregnancy was performed at 32 weeks of gestation. At the delivery, the only morphologic anomaly was the prominent microcephaly.""Autopsy and Neuropathological Findings [are presented. Electron microscopy showed virus-like particles in brain tissue.]""Microbiologic Investigation""Positive results for ZIKV were obtained on RT-PCR assay only in the fetal brain sample, where 6.5-107 viral RNA copies per milligram of tissue were detected. In addition, all autopsy samples were tested on PCR assay and were found to be negative for other flaviviruses (dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus), along with chikungunya virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, enteroviruses, and _Toxoplasma gondii_.--communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[This case provides additional evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the developing fetus, with teratogenic effects. The case for vertical maternal-fetal transmission would have been a bit stronger, and the timeline clearer, had the woman's Zika virus infection been confirmed in Brazil. However, since Zika virus transmission was going on at the time she was in Brazil, and since there is no Zika virus transmission going on in Slovenia, she must have been infected at some time while she was in Brazil. - Mod.TY]******[3] Ocular effectsDate: Tue 9 Feb 2016Source: JAMA Opthalmology published online doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0267 [summ. & edited]<http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2491896&utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamaophthalmol.2016.0267>Bruno de Paula Freitas, Joao Rafael de Oliveira Dias, Juliana Prazeres, Gielson Almeida Sacramento, Albert Icksang Ko, Maurcio Maia, et al. Ocular findings in infants with microcephaly associated with presumed Zika virus congenital infection in Salvador, Brazil.JAMA Opthalmology published online doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0267""AbstractImportanceZika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly reached epidemic proportions, especially in north eastern Brazil, and has rapidly spread to other parts of the Americas. A recent increase in the prevalence of microcephaly in newborn infants and vision-threatening findings in these infants is likely associated with the rapid spread of ZIKV.""ObjectiveTo evaluate the ocular findings in infants with microcephaly associated with presumed intrauterine ZIKV infection in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.""Design, setting, and participantsCase series at a tertiary hospital: 29 infants with microcephaly (defined by a cephalic circumference of 32 cm) with a presumed diagnosis of congenital ZIKV were recruited through an active search and referrals from other hospitals and health entities. The study was conducted between 1-21 Dec 2015.""InterventionsAll infants and mothers underwent systemic and ophthalmic examinations from 1-21 Dec 2015 in the Roberto Santos General Hospital, Salvador, Brazil. Anterior segment and retinal, choroidal, and optic nerve abnormalities were documented using a wide-field digital imaging system. The differential diagnosis included toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus, which were ruled out through serologic and clinical examinations.""Main outcomes and measuresOcular abnormalities associated with ZIKV:ResultsOf 29 mothers, 23 (79 per cent) reported suspected ZIKV infection signs and symptoms during pregnancy, 18 in the 1st trimester, 4 in the 2nd trimester, and one in the 3rd trimester. Of the 29 infants (58 eyes) examined (18 [62 per cent] female), ocular abnormalities were present in 17 eyes (29 per cent) of 10 children (35 per cent). Bilateral findings were found in 7 of 10 patients presenting with ocular lesions, the most common of which were focal pigment mottling of the retina and chorioretinal atrophy in 11 of the 17 eyes with abnormalities (65 per cent), followed by optic nerve abnormalities in 8 eyes (47 per cent), bilateral iris coloboma in one patient (2 eyes [12 per cent]), and lens subluxation in one eye (6 per cent).""Conclusions and relevanceCongenital infection due to presumed ZIKV exposure is associated with vision-threatening findings, which include bilateral macular and perimacular lesions as well as optic nerve abnormalities in most cases.""--communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[Although the suspected diagnosis of congenital ZIKV was also based on clinical features of the mothers during pregnancy, including cutaneous rash, fever, arthralgia, headache, itch, and malaise, apparently there was no laboratory confirmation of their Zika virus infections, nor of their newborn infants'. Laboratory confirmations would have provided a stronger case for Zika virus as the etiological agent responsible for the lesions observed.This report was also submitted by Philip Henika, and ProMED-mail thanks him. - Mod.TY]******[4] Colombia and Venezuela Guillain-Barre syndromeDate: Fri 12 Feb 2016Source: WHO Emergency Preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-february-2016-gbs-colombia-venezuela/en/>Between 30 Jan and 2 Feb 2016, the National IHR Focal Points of Colombia and Venezuela informed PAHO/WHO of increases in the number of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) cases recorded at the national level.ColombiaFrom epidemiological week (EW) 51 [week ending 25 Dec 2015] of 2015 to EW 3 of 2016 [week ending 22 Jan 2016], 86 GBS cases were reported. On average, Colombia registers 242 GBS cases per year or approximately 19 cases per month or 5 cases per week. The 86 GBS cases reported in those 5 weeks is 3 times higher than the averaged expected cases of the 6 previous years.Initial reports indicated that all the 86 reported GBS cases presented with symptoms compatible with a Zika virus infection. Of the 58 cases for which information is available, 57 per cent were male, and 95 per cent were 18 years old or older.VenezuelaFrom 1-31 Jan 2016, 252 GBS cases with a spatiotemporal association to Zika virus were reported. While cases were recorded in the majority of the federal territories of the country, 66 were detected in the state of Zulia, mainly in the Maracaibo municipality.Preliminary analysis of the GBS cases in the state of Zulia indicates that the 66 cases originated from 6 municipalities. Of the 66 cases, 30 per cent were 45-54 years old and 29 per cent were 65 years or older; 61 per cent were male and 39 per cent were female. A clinical history consistent with Zika virus infection was observed in the days prior to onset of neurological symptoms in 76 per cent of the GBS cases in the state of Zulia. Associated comorbidities were present in 65 per cent of the cases. Patients were treated with plasmapheresis and/or immunoglobulin. In some cases, according to medical indication, both treatments were used following the treatment protocol established by the Ministry of Popular Power for Health.Zika virus infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in three GBS cases, including a fatal case with no comorbidities. A total of 3 cases presenting with other neurological disorders were also biologically confirmed.Between late November [2015] to 28 Jan 2016, 192 cases of Zika virus infection were laboratory confirmed through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Of the 192 cases, 110 (57 per cent) are from the state of Zulia.WHO risk assessmentZika virus infection has been laboratory confirmed in only 3 of the reported GBS cases from Venezuela, while the infection has not been detected in any of the GBS cases from Colombia. Although the cause of the rise in GBS cases has not yet been established, similar increases have been observed in other countries, notably El Salvador and Brazil. Further investigations are needed to identify the potential role of previous infections known to be associated, or potentially associated, with GBS.WHO recommends member states affected or susceptible to Zika virus outbreaks to:- monitor the incidence and trends of neurological disorders, especially GBS, to identify variations against their expected baseline values;- develop and implement sufficient patient management protocols to manage the additional burden on health care facilities generated by a sudden increase in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome;- raise awareness among health care workers and establish and/or strengthen links between public health services and clinicians in the public and private sectors.Based on the current available information, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to Zika virus affected countries.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The WHO risk assessment points out that the association of Zika virus infection and GBS is circumstantial except for the 3 laboratory confirmed Zika virus infections in Venezuela. One hopes that future prospective studies of GBS will carry out laboratory tests for evidence of Zika virus infection.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Colombia can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16> and Venezuela at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/venezuela.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25275>.ProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data (20160211.4012212). - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
