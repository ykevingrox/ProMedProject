Contagion Live [edited]<http://www.contagionlive.com/news/therapeutic-challenge-in-treating-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec>Enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) are a subset of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) that cause diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis. The illness can progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in 5-10 percent of cases. In France between 2005-2014, a total of 54 patients were infected with EHEC O80:H2; 91 percent had HUS. Two patients had invasive infections and 2 died. Similar strains were found in Spain with all isolates belonging to the same clonal group.During January 2005 to October 2014, the Centre National de Reference Associe _Escherichia coli_, in France, collected 57 different isolates of EHEC O80:H2. Isolated from stool specimens of over 54 patients; 2 and 3 isolates each were recovered from 2 patients. The publication stated that among the 53 patients for whom clinical data were available, 49 (91 percent) had HUS; 27 (51 percent) were male. Median age for these 48 patients was 1.2 years (range 0.2-39 years, interquartile range [IQR] 0.7-1.6 years). Only 1 adult HUS patient (a 39-year-old) was reported. The 5 (9 percent) non-HUS patients were largely older (1, 2, 6, 21, and 40 years old). Among HUS patients, fever was present in 45 percent; median leukocyte count was 13 000 cells/mm3 (data were not available for 14 patients), and 56 percent had leukocytosis (greater than 11 500 leukocytes/mm3).Several studies demonstrated that the effect of antibiotics on HUS depended on their class in the study. Ciprofloxacin raises the production and release of Stx in vitro and is associated with a higher mortality rate in pigs. Yet, other studies indicate azithromycin might decrease the production and release of Stx. However, during a 2011 outbreak of EHEC O104 infection in Germany, a patient treated by ciprofloxacin plus imipenem unexpectedly had a better prognosis.Despite promising in vitro results, the authors of the study could not advocate the use of these antibiotics for treatment of patients infected with EHEC O80:H2. While potentially promising, these findings are preliminary and require confirmation.[Byline: Jenina Pellegren]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This interesting study (Soysal N, Patricia Mariani-Kurkdjian P, Smail Y, et al: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli hybrid pathotype O80:H2 as a new therapeutic challenge. Emerg Infect Dis 2016; 9: 1607-1612) brings forth more information regarding this hybrid EHEC which contains a rare variant of the intimin gene and genetic determinants related to a plasmid, found mostly in avian pathogenic _E. coli_ and _E. coli_ that causes human neonatal meningitis, which is associated with extraintestinal virulence. This group, led by Stephane Bonacorsi, originally reported this atypical organism in an adult associated with HUS with a relapse associated with bacteremia (Mariani-Kurkdjian P, Lemaire C, Bidet P, et al: Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome with bacteraemia caused by a new hybrid _Escherichia coli_ pathotype. New Microbes New Infect 2014;2: 127-131).The new study reported that 96 percent of the cases were associated with HUS but the authors do point out that the surveillance system for EHEC is voluntary in France and PCR assays for Shiga toxin in stool is only done in cases involving diarrhea with HUS suspicion so the denominator of total O80:H2 cases is not known. Likewise, whether this organism is zoonotic is also not clear and the areas in France with this strain are not where most cases of _E. coli_ O157 are reported.Regarding the use of antimicrobials, the issue is relevant in these cases since some of them are associated with bacteremia which requires antimicrobial therapy. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were not associated with increasing Shiga toxin production whereas ciprofloxacin was, in this study. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, therapy was also used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain was a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and was not thought to be a zoonosis.Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC will indeed introduce another layer of concern about these infections. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>.]
