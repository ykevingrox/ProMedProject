UN OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/SS_161005_OCHA_SouthSudan_humanitarian_bulletin15.pdf>The 2016 cholera outbreak in South Sudan has now affected 6 counties, with Fangak being the latest to have confirmed cases. As of [3 Oct 2016], 2450 cases and 37 deaths with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.51 per cent have been reported compared with 1814 cases and 47 deaths (CFR 2.59 per cent) at the same time in 2015. Although deaths and the CFR are lower in 2016 than in 2015, affected areas have increased.Other affected areas include Juba and Terekeka in Central Equatoria, Duk and Fangak in Jonglei, Pageri in Eastern Equatoria, and Awerial in Lakes. In Awerial, the outbreak, which began at Mingkaman Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp, has spread to the host community, with 4 cases including one death reported in Kalthouk. The 2015 outbreak was confined to Juba in Central Equatoria and Bor in Jonglei. Juba is the worst affected area in 2016, as in 2015.The spike in conflict in July 2016 and subsequent displacement contributed to the spread of cholera and left many people with inadequate sanitation facilities and insufficient access to clean water, while people exposed to the disease carried it to new areas as they fled. Continued population movement due to the ongoing conflict in the Greater Equatoria has further spread the outbreak to other locations and across the border to the refugee camps in Uganda. IDP camps reporting cases in 2016 include UN House PoC, Tongping UNMISS transit site, Gorom refugee camp, Mahad, Mangatain, and Gumbo in Juba and Nimule.To contain the outbreak, health and WASH [Water, Sanitation and Hygiene] partners have set up cholera treatment centres and units (CTC/U) and oral rehydration points (ORP) in the affected counties. Health and hygiene promotion among communities are on-going, together with the distribution of water purification sachets and tablets, soap and oral rehydration salts (ORS). 17 radio channels are reaching 2 million people per day with messages on cholera. Local mobile networks are disseminating prevention information to subscribers through bulk messages, while the toll free line -- 1144 -- remains open for the public to report cases and get information.A total of 29 291 people in the parts of Juba that are worst affected by the outbreak received a single dose of the oral cholera vaccine each between [17 and 20 Sep 2016].--communicated by:ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of South Sudan can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45275>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Cholera - Congo DR (Maniema Province)Date: Sun 25 Sep 2016 19:05 WATSource: Radio Okapi [in French, machine trans., edited]<http://www.radiookapi.net/2016/09/25/actualite/sante/lepidemie-de-cholera-declaree-kindu>The governor of Maniema province, Pascal Salumu Tutu, said [Sat 24 Sep 2016] the cholera outbreak in the city of Kindu. The outbreak was confirmed after analysis of samples carried out by the National Institution of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa, he said to reporters.From epidemiological week 29 [week ending 22 Jul 2016], the health area has recorded 51 cases and 2 deaths due to diarrhea, according Tutu Salumu. It was after the analyses of samples taken and sent to the INRB Kinshasa in epidemiological week 36 [week ending 9 Sep 2016] that ""_Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, was isolated, which confirms this epidemic"" in Kindu. ""I declare a cholera outbreak in the city of Kindu and seek the support of the central government, development and humanitarian partners, as well people of goodwill"", said governor Salumu.The head of the provincial executive recommends people consult the nearest health center in case of severe dehydration from acute diarrhea with or without vomiting. Indeed, the source said, ""is all we have to fight effectively to defeat cholera."" The provincial government has 2 ambulances to bring all suspected cases in the town and surrounding areas to the hospital and ensure rapid support to infected patients. For quick and effective response against the spread of the disease in the region, UNICEF is working with the provincial government and NGO partners for appropriate emergency measures, indicate local health sources.--communicated by:ProMED-FRA<promed-fra@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Congo DR can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2942>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] Cholera - Nigeria (Lagos State)Date: Thu 22 Sep 2016Source: PM News [edited]<http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2016/09/22/breaking-lagos-records-6-deaths-from-cholera-outbreak/>Lagos State Government says it has recorded 6 deaths from cholera outbreak out of 45 cases in some communities in Isolo Local Council Development Area (LCDA). Dr Jide Idris, the state commissioner for health, who made the disclosure on [Thu 22 Sep 2016] at a news conference in Lagos, however, was not specific about the timing of the incident. Idris said that state government was already taking appropriate measures and had contained the outbreak.According to him, the ministry was notified of an upsurge of diarrhea diseases in some communities in Isolo LCDA. ""Following this, 45 cases were line-listed by the epidemiology unit of the ministry. 6 deaths were recorded among the 45 cases. Most of the cases did not present with the classical rice-water stool, rather they presented with atypical diarrhea and vomiting. Ano-rectal swabs were collected from 15 cases and taken to the Central Public Health Laboratory, Yaba. Initially, there were no growths; however, continuous culture yielded _Vibrio cholerae_ from 7 out of the 15 samples,"" he said.The commissioner said that the ""_Vibrio cholerae_ was later confirmed to be Ogawa strain"". He said, ""The main suspected source of infection is the salad called 'Abacha', a staple food of the residents of Isolo LCDA and adjourning LGAs [Local Government Area]/LCDAs. Some domestic wells within the communities are also suspected. Samples of the 'Abacha salad' and well water were collected and sent to the Lagos State Drug Quality Control Laboratory for analysis. The report of the analysis revealed the presence of _Vibrio cholerae_, _Salmonella_ species, and _Escherichia coli_ in 'Abacha' and one of the 2 well water samples.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56121>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]*****[4] Cholera - BeninDate: Thu 22 Sep 2016Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2016-000099-ben>An initial 3 cholera cases were reported in So-Ava [Atlantique Department] and an outbreak was declared on 16 Aug 2016 by local government authorities. Reported and verified cases were few in the early weeks and considered manageable by local authorities, but a sharp and heightened spike in the number of confirmed cases between 25-30 Aug 2016 in the 3 main areas of Cotonou [Littoral Department], Savalou [Collines Department] and So-Ava resulted in a request from Benin Red Cross Society to IFRC [International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies] for support through DREF [Disaster Relief Emergency Fund] to respond. As of 4 Sep 2016, a total of 281 cases and 9 deaths were recorded with a 3.20 per cent case fatality rate, with Cotonou the most affected area to date.

Omar Saleh, responsible for emergencies at the WHO Office in Sana'a, explained at a press conference that a total of 1243 epidemic recording centers are now collecting information nationwide to determine the spread of cholera.The supervisor of the Department of Epidemiological Isolation at the Al Sabain Hospital in Sana'a, where patients have been treated, told Efe [news agency] that among them there are 8 people from the same family suffering from acute diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue.Yuber Sadiq said that these are the 1st cases that have reached the hospital, where they are surprised by the appearance of cholera, which spreads very fast through water and vegetables.In Yemen, thousands of families live in unsanitary conditions in camps for displaced persons since the resurgence of the war in March 2015, when the Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia against Shiite rebels intervened in the country. In May 2015, the NGO Oxfam reported that nearly 2/3 of the Yemeni population, about 16 million people, had no access to drinking water, due to aerial bombing, fighting, and lack of fuel in the Arab state, which is the poorest in the region.According to Oxfam, the population is being forced to drink unsafe water. Because of the destruction of infrastructure, which increases the risk of diseases potentially life threatening, such as malaria, cholera, and diarrhea.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Yemen can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[6] Cholera - YemenDate: Fri 7 Oct 2016Source: UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/unicef-supports-health-centres-yemen-respond-cholera-outbreak>Health authorities in Yemen confirmed a cholera outbreak on Thu 6 Oct 2016, posing an increased health risk to the population -- especially children -- given the crumbling health system in the country. ""This outbreak adds to the misery of millions of children in Yemen. We are supporting health centres to prevent and treat cholera cases and will continue working with partners to scale up the response and stem this dangerous disease,"" said UNICEF representative in Yemen, Julien Harneis.Health authorities announced that cholera cases have been confirmed in the capital, Sana'a, while others are suspected in the south western city of Taiz. UNICEF and partners are working to establish the exact scale of the outbreak. If not treated, severe cases of cholera can kill up to 15 per cent of people affected in just a few hours.""Children are at a particularly high risk if the current cholera outbreak is not urgently contained, especially since the health system in Yemen is crumbling as the conflict continues. Mr Harneis said. ""We appeal to all donors to support health facilities across Yemen so that civilians in need get medical assistance.""UNICEF in partnership with the World Health Organization is supporting the response to the outbreak through delivering and securing safe water and water purification supplies. UNICEF has in place 57 diarrheal disease kits, each containing medicine, including oral rehydration salts (ORS), enough to treat 100 severe or 400 mild cases of cholera.

In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
