CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/04/news-scan-apr-21-2016>China has detected another case of H5N6 avian flu, in a 35 year old man from Hubei province who is hospitalized in a critical condition, according to a statement today [21 Apr 2016] from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP). The man's H5N6 infection is China's 8th case since the end of December [2015].The man started having symptoms on 9 Apr [2016] and was hospitalized 3 days later. The CHP report, which cited mainland health officials, didn't say how the man might have been exposed to the virus.H5N6 outbreaks in poultry have been reported in a few Asian countries, but so far China is the only one to report human cases. The novel virus was 1st identified in 2014, and since then China has reported 11 cases. The most recent previous one was announced on 15 Mar [2016].The new case is the 1st in Hubei province, lifting the number of affected provinces to 4. Most have been in Guangdong.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Since 2013, a total of 11 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 6 deaths, have been detected in China [<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_04_04_2016.pdf?ua=1>].HPAI A(H5N6) has caused widespread and significant poultry outbreaks in 2015 across mainland China and Viet Nam, with poultry detections also reported from Laos [OIE World Organisation for Animal Health. Update on highly pathogenic avian influenza in animals (Type H5 and H7). <http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza>].HPAI A(H5N6) infection has been observed to infect wild birds, most recently in Hong Kong, and so there is the possibility of wider geographical distribution In November 2014; the Food and Agriculture Organisation for the United Nations (FAO) issued a report on the threat of HPAI A(H5N6) to the poultry industry [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Avian influenza A(H5N6): the latest addition to emerging zoonotic avian influenza threats in East and South East Asia. EMPRES watch. 2014 Nov; 30: 0-6]. However, due to the widespread infection in birds and the low number of reported human cases, the report states that the WHO considers that HPAI H5N6 is unlikely to be easily transmissible from birds to humans.Clinicians should retain a high level of suspicion of influenza A(H5N6) when managing patients with suspected influenza, confirmed influenza A (unsubtyped) or confirmed influenza A (unsubtypable as seasonal H3 or H1N1pdm09) and a history of travel to China or one of the affected areas in the 10 days before the onset of symptoms. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/340>.]
