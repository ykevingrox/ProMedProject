International New York Times Opinion pages [edited]<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/opinion/testing-for-ebola.html?_r=1>To the Editor:""Ebola Case Is Reported in West Africa"" (news article, 16 Jan 2016) describes a resurgent case of Ebola in which a woman's illness was not diagnosed until after her death despite her having gone to at least one hospital.Ebola causes generic symptoms, like fever, seen with common illnesses like malaria, and needs to be identified by blood testing. You report that Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization says rapid tests capable of diagnosis within minutes with just a few drops of blood have not been used because they are prone to false positives. But patients like the one described received diagnoses only after presenting to multiple hospitals and exposing numerous people to infection.Rapid tests should have been used to screen patients, with all who test positive sent for confirmatory testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the conventional test for Ebola, to minimize the possibility of false positives. This approach mirrors what we do for many diseases, including HIV.Instead of using rapid tests in this way, patients were screened using a checklist of symptoms known as ""clinical case definition,"" which misses 20 percent of patients who actually have Ebola, while almost 70 percent of the patients it does identify do not have Ebola.As a result, up to 40 percent of people admitted to Ebola treatment units did not actually have Ebola, yet were hospitalized alongside and exposed to patients who did. At the same time, in one study, rapid tests did not miss a single patient with actual Ebola, and only about 8 percent were false positives.Rapid tests would have been a game-changer during the peak of the epidemic and should now be used to screen patients.[Byline: Ranu S.

If false positivity is the problem, the rate can be ascertained when there are few cases. - Mod.LK]******[2] Updates, research, funding8 Feb 2016: Sierra Leone grave robbers plundering tombs of Ebola victims<http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/02/08/world/social-issues-world/sierra-leone-grave-robbers-may-be-plundering-tombs-of-ebola-victims/#.Vrj5u0_LLnk>[New security measures were in place Sun [7 Feb 2016] at cemeteries in the Sierra Leone capital Freetown after grave robbers used pickaxes and sledgehammers to pry open tombs and steal coffins and jewelry.

Alcoholism, depression and drug addiction are raging, health officials say, in countries that have even fewer psychiatrists than doctors.Their ranks include a 30-year-old former child soldier who signed up in 2014 to bury the bodies of Ebola victims in coastal Liberia's chest-high grass and mud. Three months into the job, he helped inter a body bag containing his 2-year-old daughter.These days, like hundreds of other so-called burial boys, he no longer spends his days dressed in hazmat clothing, removing the dead from their homes. His USD 350 monthly paycheck for the dangerous assignment no longer comes.Instead, he sleeps in a church, screams in his sleep and worries he might be somehow responsible for his daughter's death. By day, he sells sand and sometimes pawns his clothes to buy cheap rum and Italian White, as heroin is called here. He left home, he says, to give his family some relief.Non-government organization----------------------8 Feb 2016: Special Report: The World Health Organization's critical challenge - healing itself<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-who-future-special-report-idUSKCN0VH0ZI>[...For years the WHO has talked about streamlining its complex structure, governance and financing to make it more efficient.

Bacterial sequences detected in 99 out of 99 serum samples from Ebola patients. _Bio Rxiv_. 9 Feb 2016. On-line pub. doi: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/039107>[Abstract-------Evolution and clinical manifestations of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection overlap with the pathologic processes that occur in sepsis(1). Some viruses certainly compromise the immune system, leading to a breach in the integrity of the mucosal epithelial barrier, thus allowing bacterial translocation(2,3). Guided by these facts, we wondered if bacteria could be involved in the pathogenesis of some of the septic shock-like symptoms typical of EBOV infected patients, something that could have a dramatic impact on the design of new treatment approaches. We decided to search for bacteria in available EBOV patient sequence datasets. Given that EBOV is an RNA virus and that, hence, some NGS sequencing experiments carried out to sequence the EBOV genomes were RNA-Seq experiments, we thought that, if there were any bacteria in patient serum, at least some bacterial RNA might probably be detected in the sequenced material from Ebola patients. Thus, we searched for bacteria in a RNA-Seq public dataset from 99 Ebola samples from the last outbreak(4), and surprisingly, in spite of the certainly suboptimal experimental conditions for bacterial RNA sequencing, we found bacteria in all of the 99 samples. New perspective in Ebola disease clinical intervention----------------------------------This work could open a new perspective in both the pathogenesis and the treatment of EBOV infections. These findings suggest that sepsis therapies, specific antibiotics and mucosal epithelial barrier protectors could be considered. It is possible that, as in other immunocompromised patients, the crucial interventions would be targeting those bacteria. This is especially important in the case of EVD because there is not a specific treatment for Ebola virus.References cited above.1 Bray M, Mahanty S. Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever and Septic Shock.
