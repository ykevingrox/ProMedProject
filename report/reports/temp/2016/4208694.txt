7th Space Interactive [edited]<http://7thspace.com/headlines/526732/chp_ investigates_ outbreak_of_ upper_respiratory_ tract_infection_at_ kindergarten_in_ wan_ chai.html>The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [6 May 2016] investigating an outbreak of upper respiratory tract infection (URI) at a kindergarten in Wan Chai, and appealed to members of the public to stay alert and maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene.The outbreak involves 20 students, 14 boys and 6 girls, aged from 3 to 5, who have developed URI symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose since 21 Apr 2016. 16 of them sought medical consultation; 3 of them were hospitalised, and 2 have been discharged.The respiratory specimens of 2 hospitalised children tested positive for adenovirus upon laboratory testing. All the affected children are in a stable condition.Officers of the CHP conducted a site visit to the kindergarten and provided preventive advice against URI. The kindergarten has been placed under medical surveillance.Adenoviruses are a group of viruses which infect the mucus membranes. Depending on the type of virus, they may cause respiratory illnesses but also diarrhea, eye infections and rashes. Infections can occur all year round. Young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients are more susceptible.""The infection mainly spreads through air droplets, direct contact of the oro-nasal secretions of patients, or ingestion of contaminated food or water, and may cause outbreaks of acute respiratory or eye infections in institutional settings such as schools and hospitals,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.To prevent adenovirus infection, the public should take heed of the measures below:* Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;* Build up good body immunity by having a balanced diet, regular exercise and adequate rest, reducing stress and avoiding smoking;* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharge properly;* Wash hands thoroughly before handling food and eating, and after going to the toilet or handling vomitus, faecal matter and oro-nasal secretions;* Wear gloves while disposing of vomitus, faeces and diapers, and wash hands afterwards;* Clean and disinfect contaminated articles and surfaces promptly and thoroughly with 1:49 diluted household bleach (1 part of household bleach in 49 parts of water);* Avoid touching the eyes with hands;* Do not share towels and toilet articles;* Avoid sharing eye medicines, eye make-up and other items that may come into contact with the eyes;* Avoid crowded places where ventilation is unsatisfactory; and* Children developing symptoms of infection should refrain from going to school and seek medical advice.The public may visit the CHP's page on adenovirus infection (<http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/9/24/13464.html>) for more information.--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[Acute adenovirus respiratory disease is caused predominantly by adenovirus types 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6; occasionally, 3 and 7. Over half of adenovirus respiratory infections do not cause symptoms. Adenoviruses account for 10 percent of all childhood lower respiratory tract infections.The contagiousness of adenovirus is facilitated by very high levels of viral particles (100 000-1 000 000/mL) in the sputum or oral secretions of infected adults <http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/211738-clinical>.Fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and sore throat, usually lasting 3-5 days, are typical clinical features of adenoviral respiratory disease. Causes of sore throat may include pharyngitis, adenoiditis, or tonsillitis. Tonsillitis and otitis media were reported in up to 60 percent and 30 percent, respectively, in a series of young children with serotype 4 predominance. Prolonged fevers, leukocytosis, and elevations in C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) were also noted in over half of cases, suggesting potential for confusion of this viral syndrome with bacterial infections [Tabain I, Ljubin-Sternak S, Cepin-Bogovic J, Markovinovic L, Knezovic I, Mlinaric-Galinovic G. Adenovirus Respiratory Infections in Hospitalized Children: Clinical Findings in Relation to Species and Serotypes. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2012 Apr 18]. Lower respiratory tract infections, including tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, may mimic respiratory syncytial virus infection or influenza. Notably, conjunctivitis in the presence of bronchitis suggests adenoviral infection.Laboratory diagnosis of adenovirus infection rarely affects management. During the acute illness, virus can be isolated from respiratory and ocular secretions and frequently from stool and urine. A 4-fold rise in the serum antibody titer indicates recent adenoviral infection.Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Ribavirin and cidofovir have been used in immunocompromised patients.Vaccines containing live adenovirus types 4 and 7, given orally in an enteric-coated capsule, can reduce lower respiratory disease. The vaccine was unavailable for a number of years but was reintroduced in 2011. However, it may be given to patients aged 17 through 50 years and should not be given to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.In case of an outbreak such as the one from a kindergarten facility in the above report, preventive measures will be the only available option to prevent more cases. To minimize transmission, heath care practitioners should change gloves and wash hands after examining infected patients, sterilize instruments adequately, and avoid using ophthalmologic instruments in multiple patients. Caregivers of infected patients must be advised to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene as well. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
