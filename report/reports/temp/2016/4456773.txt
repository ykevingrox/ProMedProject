KBS World Radio [edited]<http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Sc_detail.htm?No=121496>A man in Gwangju has been confirmed to be infected with Japanese encephalitis [virus], marking the 1st reported case of the mosquitoborne virus in the country this year [2016]. Gwangju City said [Wed 31 Aug 2016] that the man, in his 50s, tested positive for Japanese encephalitis after he was hospitalized on [16 Aug 2016] due to high fever and seizures, which are common symptoms of the disease.Gwangju's quarantine authorities said the man is likely to have been bitten by a mosquito carrying the disease [virus] while working, citing that an epidemiological investigation found that he had not gone abroad this year.The latest case is not alarming as the nation saw 40 cases of Japanese encephalitis last year [2015]. However, quarantine officials were quick to stress the need for extra caution as mosquitoes are active until late October.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This case is not surprising since Korea is within the endemic area of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus. Although the conditions under which the man acquired his JE infection are not given, it is likely to have been in an agricultural area where the mosquito vectors are common at this time of year and birds that are the reservoir hosts are present and breeding. Transmission of JE virus will continue until the 1st killing frosts of autumn occur. - Mod.TYMaps of South Korea can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/south-korea/maps/south-korea-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/21482>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
