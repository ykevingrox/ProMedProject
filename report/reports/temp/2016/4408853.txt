Health authorities in Abuja have, however, remained silent, with key officials refusing to be quoted.The 2 cases of wild polio virus (WPV) were discovered in Gwarzo and Jere Local Government Areas of Borno State, yesterday [10 Aug 2016].A top health official told The Guardian the country has decided to term it a 'suspicion', while it seeks the best approach to break the news to the public.It was learnt WHO could announce the development at a press conference in Geneva tomorrow [12 Aug 2016]. Last month, [24 Jul 2016], Nigeria celebrated 2 years without any new case of polio.[byline: By Emeka Anuforo]--communicated by:Lawal Ademola Lukman  Resident Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program<demolawaluk@gmail.com>******[2]Date: 11 Aug 2016Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The virus is type 1, all the children are under 3 years and have received more than 5 doses. The state has been asked to prepare immediate response plan to cover the two affected wards in Jere and Gwoza LGAs. bOPV is available for this and subsquent rounds that will be mounted in wider areas, targeting more children than the immediate response round. More details will come your way soon. Gwoza LGA because of the insurgents there, is not fully accessible.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following comment was written before the second item above was added. It has not been amended, so that the news can be sent out promptly. Many thanks to the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project correspondents who got in touch so quickly. - Mod.SHIt is not clear from the wording of this media report if wild poliovirus (WPV) associated paralytic disease has been confirmed or if it is ""suspected"".  The last confirmed case of WPV associated disease in Nigeria had onset on 24 Jul 2014, just over 2 years ago.  It is also possible the media report is reflecting the identification of cases of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) that have not as yet been confirmed as due to poliovirus infection.On 25 Sep 2015, Nigeria was removed from the list of polio endemic countries (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/nigeria-polio/en/>).  If the media report is correct and new cases of WPV associated disease has been confirmed, then Nigeria will lose their impending polio free status declaration targeted for July 2017.In May 2016, circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) was isolated from environmental samples in Borno state, so the possibility exists that the polio isolates referred to in the above media report may be cVDPVs - if so, that would not jeopardize Nigeria's path to declaration of a polio-free country, although it does signal there continue to be pockets of low vaccination coverages that permit the circulation of the cVDPVs.More information on the types of virus identified, epidemiologic investigation of the identified cases including age, gender and vaccination history, and background information on the vaccination coverages in the districts where these cases reside would be greatly appreciated.A map of Nigeria showing states can be found at: <http://www.waado.org/images/Maps/nigeria2.gif>.  Borno state is in the extreme north east of the country bordering with Chad, Cameroon and Niger.  There was extreme resistance to vaccination activities in Borno due to extremist activity in the state and propaganda re: vaccines.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Nigeria can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.MPP]
