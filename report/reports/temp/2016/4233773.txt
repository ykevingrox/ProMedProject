Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health 6 (14) [not yet posted on the Ministry website, edited]Between weeks 1 and 18 (1 Jan-6 May 2016), 657 suspected Lassa fever cases with 63 lab-confirmed and 75 deaths (CFR, 11.42 percent) from 120 LGAs [local government areas] (27 states) were reported compared with 101 suspected cases with 8 lab-confirmed and 3 deaths (CFR, 2.97 percent) from 16 LGAs (9 states) at the same period in 2015.Lassa fever case numbers as of week 18 [week ending 6 May 2016]---------------------------------------------------------------Numbers of cases in states reported / confirmed / deathsAdamaw 8 / 0 / 1Akwa Ibom 3 / 1 / 1Bauchi 28 / 3 / 3Benue 3 / 0 / 0Delta 1 / 1 / 1Ebonyi 12 / 3 / 4Edo 229 / 17 / 6Ekiti 10 / 1 / 0FCT 14 / 2 / 0Gombe 13 / 1 / 0Kaduna 23 / 3 / 3Kano 17 / 1 / 7Katsina 11 / 1 / 0Kebbi 6 / 0 / 0Kogi 9 / 2 / 2Lagos 8 / 3 / 1Nasarawa 12 / 2 / 2Niger 59 / 0 / 19Ogun 7 / 2 / 0Ondo 82 / 10 / 11Osun 1 / 1 / 1Oyo 7 / 0 / 0Plateau 25 / 6 / 5Rivers 13 / 4 / 3Sokoto 1 / 0 / 0Taraba 43 / 0 / 3Yobe 2 / 0 / 1Total 657 / 63 / 75--Communicated by:Tayo Babalobi<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>[The reported cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase recently. The reason for the higher than usual number of fatal cases is undetermined. One possibility is an increase in the populations of the Lassa fever virus reservoir host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp), with an increase in numbers of virus carriers due to more favorable environmental conditions for them. This could result in more contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents.Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY******[2] Liberia: WHODate: Wed 18 May 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/18-may-2016-lassa-fever-liberia/en/>Since 1 Jan 2016, WHO has been notified of at least 38 suspected cases of Lassa fever in Liberia.Suspected cases were reported from 6 prefectures: Bong (17 cases, including 9 deaths), Nimba (14 cases, including 6 deaths), Gbarpolu (4 cases), Lofa (1 case), Margibi (1 case), and Montserrado (1 case).Between 1 Jan and 3 Apr 2016, samples from 24 suspected cases were received for laboratory testing. Of these 24 suspected cases, 7 are reported to have tested positive for Lassa fever:- 2 cases were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR);- 2 cases were identified through the detection of IgM antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA);- 2 cases were identified through the detection of Lassa virus antigens using ELISA;- information on the type of testing employed to identify the seventh case is not currently available.All the Lassa fever confirmed cases tested negative for Ebola virus disease. Since there are no designated laboratories in Liberia that can test samples for Lassa fever by PCR, specimens are currently sent for testing to Kenema, Sierra Leone.Public health response----------------------To date, 134 contacts have completed the 21-day follow-up period. A total of 17 additional contacts are being monitored. None of these contacts have so far developed symptoms.Appropriate outbreak response measures, including case management, infection prevention and control, community engagement and health education, have been put in place by the national authorities with the support of WHO and partner organizations.WHO risk assessment------------------Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the country. Based on experiences from previous similar events, it is expected that additional cases will be reported.Although occasional travel-associated cases of Lassa fever have been reported in the past (see DON published on 27 and 8 April 2016), jthe risk of disease spread from Liberia to non-endemic countries is considered to be low. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.WHO advice----------Considering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre [39 in]) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Liberia based on the current information available.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Liberia has been the source of 2 imported Lassa fever cases in the recent past. This year (2016) there was a confirmed case of Lassa fever diagnosed (1 Apr 2016) in a 72-year-old woman returning to Sweden from Liberia. She had been travelling there for 6 weeks, with the last couple of weeks in the northern and northwestern parts. In 2004 there was a businessman who acquired his infection there, returned to New Jersey, USA, and died there. These cases illustrate 3 points: (1) that an accurate travel history is essential to narrow the field of possible diagnoses; (2) provisional diagnosis supported by appropriate laboratory tests is a critical step in arriving at the final diagnosis; and (3) prompt treatment in an isolation unit with proper personal protective equipment is essential to avoid nosocomial infections of health care workers, which has been a significant problem in hospitals in the endemic Lassa virus areas of Africa.Maps of Liberia at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/liberia/li2r765a/liberia_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>. - Mod.TY]
