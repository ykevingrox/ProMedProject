Western Telegraph [edited]<http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/14678934.MMR_vaccine_call_after_measles_cases_in_ Pembrokeshire/>Public Health Wales is urging parents to ensure their children are up to date with MMR vaccine following measles cases in Pembrokeshire.Six cases of the infection have been reported since the beginning of July 2016, with 2 new cases in Pembrokeshire in the last week. The new cases, one probable and one confirmed, are in addition to 4 cases previously reported in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Powys.All cases have links to festivals in England, leading Public Health Wales to urge people not to attend big events without checking whether they and their children are up to date with MMR vaccination.Sion Lingard, Consultant in Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said: ""After not seeing cases of measles in Wales for some time, we're concerned at 6 cases being reported in just over a month. It is important that those that have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine get vaccinated so that they are protected from this preventable disease. People who are not vaccinated not only risk catching measles themselves, but could also pass it to babies too young to have received MMR and who are at risk of serious complications. Anyone who has a rash that could be measles is urged not to attend events where unvaccinated people could be present, but to seek advice from their GP. Do not attend A&E or your GP surgery without calling 1st, as if you do have measles, you could pass it to others in the waiting room.""Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral disease that can cause complications and can even prove fatal. The illness starts with cold or flu-like symptoms, followed by a rash after 2-4 days. Crowds of people provide the perfect environment for infectious diseases like measles to circulate, but 2 doses of the safe and effective MMR vaccine offers protection.Many people who catch measles will have a fever, cough, red eyes, and blocked nose and feel generally unwell. The blotchy rash appears a few days later beginning on the face and spreading downwards to the rest of the body over several days.If you have not received 2 doses of MMR and attend large events where hundreds of people are present, you are at risk of contracting measles. People around you may not have any symptoms, but could still be infectious.Vaccination is free on the NHS by arranging an appointment with your GP, and it's never too late to catch up on missed doses. Children should receive their 1st dose of the vaccine at 12 months of age and the 2nd at around 3 years and 4 years of age, but older children and adults can receive the vaccination at any time.More information about measles is available from the Public Health Wales website: <http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?orgId=457&pid=25444>.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Festivals have been the source of measles cases this summer [2016] in the UK. Since more festivals will be taking place, such as the Reading Festival, there are concerns that this could lead to further outbreaks. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications; people -- especially those attending festivals in the UK or large gatherings anywhere where measles has been active this year -- should check their vaccination status.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Wales and the UK may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/281> - Mod.LK]******[2] Taiwan ex Thailand: imported caseDate: Sat 13 Aug 2016Source: Focus Taiwan News Channel [edited]<http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201608130020.aspx>A 9-year-old boy was diagnosed with measles after returning to Taiwan from a trip to Thailand, and the Centers for Disease Control is urging people who have had contact with the boy to watch their health closely.The CDC said in a news release Saturday [13 Aug 2016] that the boy traveled with his parents to Bangkok from [21 to 27 Jul 2016] and developed a fever and nausea 4 days after returning to Taiwan.The boy was confirmed as having the measles on [11 Aug 2016], but he has since recovered and is out of quarantine.During the boy's communicable period [4-12 Aug 2016], the boy visited a shopping center in Taipei, rode the high-speed rail and regular railway, and stayed at a Kaohsiung hotel.The CDC has tracked 137 people who have had contact with the boy and will continue to monitor their health.People who have come in contact with the boy are urged to watch their health for 18 days and wear surgical masks when seeking medical treatment if they develop suspicious symptoms.Taiwan has reported 12 confirmed measles cases so far this year [2016]. Among them, 5 were indigenous ones, while 7 others were imported, with 2 of the cases originating in mainland China and one each in Hong Kong, Viet Nam, India, Japan and Thailand.Taiwan recorded a total of 29 measles cases last year [2015], including 23 indigenous cases and 6 imported from mainland China.[Byline: Chen Wei-ting and Lilian Wu]--Communicated by:PRO/MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[Measles is a contagious viral illness that impacts millions of children in the Western Pacific Region. Although a safe vaccine has been available since 1963, measles remains a leading cause of childhood preventable death and disability. It is estimated that 20 000-30 000 deaths in the region are due to measles annually.Measles is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downward <http://www.wpro.who.int/topics/measles/en/>.Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of getting infected when they travel internationally.Before any international travel:- Infants 6 months through 11 months of age should receive one dose of MMR vaccine.- Children 12 months of age and older should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.- Teenagers and adults who do not have evidence of immunity against measles should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.- Infants who get one dose of MMR vaccine before their 1st birthday should get 2 more doses (one dose at 12 through 15 months of age and another dose at least 28 days later).Acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity against measles includes at least one of the following: written documentation of adequate vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of measles, or birth in the United States before 1957 <http://www.cdc.gov/measles/travelers.html>. - Mod.ST]For the HealthMap of Taiwan, see: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>.For the HealthMap of Thailand, see: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151>.]******[3] Myanmar (Naga self-administered zone, Sagaing Division) outbreakDate: Sun 14 Aug 2016Source: Anadolu Agency [edited]<http://aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/remote-myanmar-measles-outbreak-claims-another-child/628266>Days after Myanmar authorities claimed to have brought a measles outbreak that has killed dozens in a remote and impoverished region under control, another child has died of the illness.A health ministry official said Sun [14 Aug 2016] that the 6-year-old died late Sat [13 Aug 2016], bringing the death toll to 42 in 9 villages in the Naga Self-Administered Zone in Sagaing region, a mountainous area populated by people from the Naga tribes on the border with India.""The child was in his final stage [of life] when the doctors arrived at the village,"" Zone Chairman Kay Sai told Anadolu Agency by phone.State-run newspapers reported Friday [12 Aug 2016] that no more deaths from the viral disease had been reported in the region, as the situation was finally under control. A medical team, however, is yet to reach to some villages in the area due to transportation difficulties. A major factor in the spread of the disease has been the problem officials had reaching the remote area to administer vaccines.Myint Han, head of the department of medical care under the Ministry of Health and Sports, told Anadolu Agency on Sun [14 Aug 2016] that around 20 people remain in critical condition in intensive care. ""The doctors are also administrating the vaccinations for children and some adults in the area,"" he said.On 7 Aug [2016], state media reported that many of those suffering had ""measles,"" with the virus found in the blood of 3 out of 5 children tested. Early reports suggested that the then unknown illness led to rashes, difficulty breathing, and the patient coughing up specks of blood. It is one of the many infections that have struck the area since early June 2016, with hundreds affected by viral diseases including diarrhea, influenza, cough and eye problems.Around 120 000 people live in Sagaing, where many Naga communities -- a conglomeration of several tribes inhabiting the northeastern part of India and northwestern Myanmar -- are impoverished and inaccessible by road.Measles -- a highly infectious viral illness -- is uncommon in many societies due to the effectiveness of vaccinations.[Byline: Kyaw Ye Lynn]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
