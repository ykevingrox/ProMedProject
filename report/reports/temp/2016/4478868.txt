Contagion Live [edited]<http://www.contagionlive.com/news/cdc-releases-genome-sequencing-data-on-antibioticresistant-salmonella>The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) tracks changes in the antimicrobial susceptibility of certain enteric bacteria found in ill people, retail meats, and food animals in the United States. This is possible through collaboration among state and local public health departments, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).For the 1st time in its annual reporting, NARMS has included whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for bacteria from individuals with antibiotic-resistant _Salmonella_ infections. WGS enables CDC officials to track antibiotic resistance patterns and trends more effectively.The NARMS 2014 Human Isolates Report provides the most recent data on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria such as: _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Campylobacter_, _E. coli_ O157, and _Vibrio_ species other than _Vibrio cholerae_.All 50 states and the District of Columbia participated, representing the entire United States population of approximately 319 million persons. The report highlighted some encouraging trends:Multidrug resistance in _Salmonella_ was similar to the previous year and has remained stable, between 9 percent and 11 percent over the past 10 years. Resistance to ceftriaxone in _Salmonella_ remained rare, and resistance to certain groups of antibiotics in _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (ACSSuT) and _Salmonella_ Newport (ACSSuTAuCx) remained lower in 2014 compared with the years 2004 through 2008.No _Salmonella_ isolates had decreased susceptibility to both azithromycin and ciprofloxacin, and none had both decreased susceptibility to azithromycin and resistance to ceftriaxone, which are important drugs for the treatment of severe _Salmonella_ infections.There were some concerning trends as well, including multidrug resistance in a common _Salmonella_ serotype greater than 40 percent. Resistance more than doubled since 2011 (18 percent in 2011 vs 43 percent in 2014) and has been linked to animal exposure and eating pork or beef, including meat purchased from live animal markets.6 of the 51 ceftriaxone-resistant _Salmonella_ in 2014 had an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene identified by WGS. ESBLs are rare among _Salmonella_ in the United States; many of these infections are acquired during international travel.Among _Salmonella_ serotypes Dublin, Heidelberg, Newport, and Typhimurium, nearly 2/3rds of the isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone. Decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in _Salmonella_ was found to be higher in 2014 (4 percent) than in the baseline period between the years 2004 and 2008 (2 percent) and between the years 2009 and 2013 (3 percent). Healthcare and public health officials are encouraged to review the data for themselves. To aid others in viewing all of the data, an interactive web tool has been developed.According to a media statement released by the CDC, ""With WGS, health officials can rapidly detect genes that make bacteria resistant to some antibiotics which are critically important to treat infections.""[Byline: Jenina Pellegren]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[2]Date: Fri 9 Sep 2016Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/09/news-scan-sep-09-2016>A new study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases shows that 20 percent of _Salmonella_ isolates collected from blood samples are resistant to antimicrobials, including 1st-line antibiotics [1]. According to the authors, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug-resistance in nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ is now a serious health threat.The isolates were collected from blood samples gathered from 2003 to 2013 in the United States through the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). Men over the age of 65 were at greatest risk for infection with _Salmonella_ resistant to 1st-line treatments.19 percent of isolates were resistant to tetracycline, a commonly used antibiotic. Ceftriaxone resistance slightly increased in blood isolates over the study period. _Salmonella_ serotypes Enteritidis, Javiana, Panama, and Typhimurium were more likely to show resistance to antimicrobials than were other strains._Salmonella_ is one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States, causing at least 1 million illnesses each year. While most cases resolve on their own, severe cases require antibiotic treatment. The CDC said there are now more than 100 000 cases of drug-resistant _Salmonella_ each year.[1.
