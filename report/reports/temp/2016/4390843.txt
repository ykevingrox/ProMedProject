DNAinfo New York [edited]<https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160731/west-harlem/2-cases-of-legionnairesdisease-found-at-harlem-apartment-complex-city>The [New York] city's Department of Health is investigating 2 cases of legionnaires' disease at a West Harlem apartment complex, officials said [Fri 29 Jul 2016]. The cases of the waterborne illness emerged in the past 10 months at Savoy Park, at 2300 Fifth Ave., health department spokesman Christopher Miller told DNAinfo New York.This is the 1st acknowledgement of an investigation involving the disease since an outbreak last summer [2015] in the South Bronx, which killed 12 people and sickened more than 120. The city receives an average of 200 to 400 reports of the disease a year, officials said. The CDC estimates there have been at least 110 reported cases in the city so far in 2016.Health department officials said the 2 cases are not considered to be a part of an outbreak and have yet to find the source. ""While the risk of infection to tenants is very low, as part of routine protocol to assess potential sources of _Legionella_, the department is working with the building management to test the building's water supply,"" Miller said.The Bronx outbreak [last summer, 2015] was traced to 15 cooling towers, which prompted new legislation from the city. [After extensive sampling of cooling towers and testing of _Legionella_ bacteria, genotyping matched the _Legionella_ strain found in the Opera House Hotel cooling tower with the strain found in patients and the New York City Health Department concluded that this cooling tower was the source of the outbreak [see Legionellosis - USA (10): (New York City) outbreak over, source found, RFI 20150821.3592871]. Officials said the West Harlem building does not have cooling towers. Residents said the management company, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, hired an environmental company to sanitize the building's water towers. But some are still worried. Officials said water testing would be done at the building. Residents were notified on [26 and 29 Jul 2016] in letters from the building's management company regarding how the health department is addressing the 2 cases. The health department has also met with residents to address their concerns.Tenants can still use and drink water but tenants with compromised immune systems should follow the precautions below, officials said: - Don't take a shower, even a cool shower, since it could create water mist. Instead, take a bath, but fill the tub slowly;- try to minimize your time in the bathroom while the tub is filling;- it's fine to wash dishes, but fill the sink slowly to avoid creating mist;- it's fine to drink cold water from the tap, but start with cold water when heating water for tea, coffee, or cooking;- you do not need to wear a mask; [and]- it is important to continue to wash your hands.[Byline: Dartunorro Clark]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Legionnaires' disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which live in biofilms in natural and synthetic aquatic environments. The most frequent route of infection is inhalation of contaminated aerosols, which can be produced by faucets, showers, or cooling towers. Legionnaires' disease can also follow aspiration when a person drinks _Legionella_-contaminated potable water. While many well-publicized, outbreaks of legionnaires' disease have their origin in contaminated cooling towers, many cases are likely coming from domestic building water systems, used for showering, washing dishes, drinking, etc. We are told in the news report above that the West Harlem building in which the patients lived does not have cooling towers, but does have a water tower that the building's management company had sanitized. The date when the water tower was sanitized is not specified. In New York City, the water mains provide only enough pressure to deliver water as high as the 6th floor of multistory buildings. Buildings taller than 6 stories have a pumping system that pushes the water from the basement to rooftop water tanks. The water for domestic use (such as, drinking and showering) exits at a pipe about midway down the tank and is distributed under pressure supplied by gravity to tenants in their apartments below. Another pipe near the bottom of the tank is used for sprinkler systems and firefighting.These rooftop water towers are easily visible on the city's skyline; see pictures at <http://www.amny.com/real-estate/city-living/water-towers-nyc-s-misunderstood-icons-1.6982696> and <http://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-water-tanks/>. The tanks could heat up in the sun and be an obvious source of _Legionella_. The tanks are known to be subject to bacterial contamination with _Escherichia coli_ and periodic cleaning of the tanks is required by the city's building and health codes. It is up to building owners to ensure that their tanks are cleaned, inspected, and tested for bacteria annually (<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/nyregion/inside-citys-water-tanks-layers-of-neglect.html>).We are not told in the news report above if isolates of _Legionella_ from the 2 patients and isolates from suspected water sources have been genotyped and if the clinical and environmental genotypes matched.

Harlem is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem>). The Savoy Park is a 7 building residential complex in Harlem, on 139th Street between Lenox Avenue and 5th Avenue (<http://www.savoyparkapartments.com>, <http://www.apartmentratings.com/ny/new-york/savoy-park-formerly-delano-village_212368811010037/>), where the Savoy Ballroom (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom>) once stood. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35071>.]
