PAHO/WHO Zika - Epidemiological Update [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=36943&lang=en>Zika virus - Incidence and trends---------------------------------To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus disease since 2015. In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases. Since the last Zika Epidemiological Update of 3 Nov 2016, Montserrat has confirmed vector-borne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in the Americas (Figure 1).[Countries included in map of Figure 1]Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Saint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; CuraÌ¤ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint BarthÌ©lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Saint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru and the United States of America.Highlighted below is a summary of the epidemiological situation by sub-regions of the Americas.North AmericaIn Mexico, since the beginning of the outbreak up to epidemiological week (EW) 39 of 2016 there continues to be an upward trend in cases.In the United States of America, autochthonous cases continue to be detected in Florida in the area of Miami Beach and in the county of Miami-Dade.Central AmericaIn Central America, Panama continues to report an increasing trend in cases between EW 36 and EW 41 of 2016. In the other countries of Central America, the trend continues to decrease.CaribbeanMontserrat, a British Overseas Territory, is the most recent territory to have detected autochthonous circulation of Zika virus.In the islands of Turks and Caicos an increasing trend of cases occurred between EW 36 and EW 38 of 2016. At the same time, other countries/territories in the Caribbean are showing a declining trend of Zika cases.South AmericaThe Peru Ministry of Health reported that as of EW 21 of 2016, an outbreak with an increasing trend has been occurring in the city of Iquitos. Iquitos is the only city in which cases continue to be detected in Peru in the last 13 weeks.All the other countries in South America continue to report decreasing numbers of Zika cases.This week the Brazil Ministry of Health reported results of a study conducted in the country between EW 1 and EW 32 of 2016 using data from the national Information System of Events Notification (Sinam-NET, per the acronym in Portuguese). According to the study, the highest number of cases was registered between EW 7 and EW 9 of 2016, with the Center-West (270 out of 100 000 population) and the Northeast (172 out of 100 000 population) reporting the highest incidence rates.Congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection--------------------------------------------------------To date, 20 countries and territories in the Americas have reported confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. Since the Zika Epidemiological Update of 3 Nov 2016, Argentina and Guadeloupe have reported confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The case in Argentina is an infant born in the province of Tucuman in EW 42 of 2016, with a gestational age of 34 weeks who presented with a 31 cm cephalic perimeter, artrogriposis of the 4 limbs, amniotic bands in the hands and left leg and intracranial malformation (ventriculomegaly and damage of the posterior fossa). The infant died within 10 days of birth.As of EW 35, Canada reported 2 maternal-fetal transmissions of Zika Virus; 1 with severe neurological anomalies.As of 1 Sep [2016], the table with the number of confirmed cases of congenital syndrome is published on a weekly basis on the PAHO/WHO website and is available at: <http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12390&Itemid=42090&lang=en>.Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders--------------------------------------------------------------Table 1 is a list of countries and territories in the Americas reporting increased cases of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of Zika virus in at least 1 GBS case.Table 1.

Zika (PRVABC59) Infection Is Associated with T cell Infiltration and Neurodegeneration in CNS of Immunocompetent Neonatal C57Bl/6 Mice. PLoS Pathog. 2016;12(11):e1006004. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006004, PMID: 27855206Abstract--------The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with increased rates of Guillain Barre [syndrome] and other neurological disorders as well as congenital defects that include microcephaly has created an urgent need to develop animal models to examine the pathogenesis of the disease and explore the efficacy of potential therapeutics and vaccines. Recently developed infection models for ZIKV utilize mice defective in interferon responses. In this study we establish and characterize a new model of peripheral ZIKV infection using immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6 mice and compare its clinical progression, virus distribution, immune response, and neuropathology with that of C57BL/6-IFNAR KO mice. We show that while ZIKV infected IFNAR KO mice develop bilateral hind limb paralysis and die 5-6 days post-infection (dpi), immunocompetent B6 WT mice develop signs of neurological disease including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures by 13 dpi that subside gradually over 2 weeks. Immunohistochemistry show viral antigen predominantly in cerebellum at the peak of the disease in both models. However, whereas IFNAR KO mice showed infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages and higher expression of IL-1, IL-6 and Cox2, B6 WT mice show a cellular infiltration in the CNS composed predominantly of T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, and increased mRNA expression levels of IFNg, GzmB and Prf1 at peak of disease. Lastly, the CNS of B6 WT mice shows evidence of neurodegeneration predominantly in the cerebellum that are less prominent in mice lacking the IFN response possibly due to the difference in cellular infiltrates and rapid progression of the disease in that model. The development of the B6 WT model of ZIKV infection will provide insight into the immunopathology of the virus and facilitate assessments of possible therapeutics and vaccines.Author Summary--------------The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with increased rates of neurological disorders and congenital defects created an urgent need for animal models to examine the pathogenesis of the disease and explore the efficacy of potential therapeutics and vaccines. We describe the 1st symptomatic PRVABC59(ZIKV) animal model in immunocompetent B6 WT mice showing that a subcutaneous challenge in 1 day old mice leads to non-lethal neurological disease that is characterized by unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures that subsides after 2 weeks. ZIKV infects neurons in cerebellum of mice and elicits the infiltration of lymphocytes into the brain. The immune response protects mice from death but may also contribute to neurodegeneration as mice with defective interferon responses have increased virus loads in brain and peripheral organs, succumbing to the disease in 5-6 days, but have fewer signs of neurodegeneration. This mouse model bypasses transplacental transmission and consequent placental insufficiency and will facilitate detailed investigations into the pathogenesis of the disease as well as mechanistic studies for possible therapeutics and vaccines. Lastly, its non-lethal outcome allows for studies assessing the long term effects of the infection, and exploring conditions that could lead to disease reactivation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It will be interesting to see if this mouse model will lead to subsequent experiments in the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines. - Mod.TY]
