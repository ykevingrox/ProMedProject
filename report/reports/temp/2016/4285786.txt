The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's Communicable Disease Control Division reported yesterday [5 Jun 2016] that the number of dengue fever cases in the Thai capital is up nearly 20 percent compared to the same period in 2015. During the 1st 5 months of 2016, Bangkok has seen 3630 dengue fever cases. This accounts for about 1/5 of Thailand's total 18 044. Health officials say the group hit hardest by the dengue surge is children ages 10-14 years. Officials do say that there have been no dengue-related fatalities in Bangkok, while nationally, Thailand has seen 15 deaths to date. Rayong, Maehongsorn, Phuket, and Trad provinces round out the top 5 most heavily affected areas. Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of the virus that can cause dengue (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, DEN4).<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/bangkok-reports-dengue-fever-increase-92762/>Bangkok. 13 Jun 2016. The Ministry of Public Health has revealed that more than 18 000 people have come down with dengue fever since the beginning of this year [2016]. Permanent Secretary for Public Health Sopon Mekthon said more than 18 300 people were infected with the dengue virus from 1 Jan to 7 Jun [2016], of whom 16 have died. Although the number of dengue patients has fallen by 14 percent from last year [2015], 5 more people were killed by the disease. The majority of infections have been occurring in the Central Plains. To mitigate the dengue outbreak this year [2016], the Ministry of Public Health has instructed related agencies to take a proactive approach to prevention, reducing the number of infections and curing those infected.<http://thainews.prd.go.th/CenterWeb/NewsEN/NewsDetail?NT01_NewsID=WNSOC5906130010017>[Maps of Thailand can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1370>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]Cambodia (national). 13 Jun 2016. The Ministry of Health, in a statement released last week [week of 6 Jun 2016], said that from January to May this year there were 1915 cases and 4 deaths from the mosquito-borne disease. Last year [2015] during the same time period, the ministry added, there were 567 cases with one death. This large number of dengue cases in the country, so early in the year, needs to be taken very seriously. A recent study published in the US-based Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is convinced that we will see a dengue epidemic in Southeast Asia due to the ""predicted extreme intensity of El NiÌ±o,"" with abnormally high atmospheric temperatures. In 2007, 407 people died of dengue hemorrhagic fever and nearly 40 000 cases were reported by the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM). That year was a nightmare for Cambodia's Ministry of Health with the highest dengue deaths on record in a single year. In 2008, the number of cases and deaths dramatically dropped with 9200 recorded dengue infections and 65 deaths. In 2012, 5 years from 2007, CNM reported 183 deaths and 41 716 cases. In 2013, the cases dropped to 59 dead and 17 491 infected. In Cambodia, the predominant mosquito species that carries the dengue virus is _Aedes aegypti_. The Ministry of Health uses temephos pellets, marketed as Abate, in water containers to kill the larva of dengue-carrying mosquitoes. The use of Abate, however, has to be followed by a health education program on the proper use of the larvicide, with intervals between applications in water explained in simple language to ensure their effectiveness. Community-based control strategies like using larva-eating guppy fish to fight the spread of dengue have been endorsed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Health Organization. ""This is a low-cost, year-round, safe way of reducing the spread of dengue in which the whole community can participate. It offers a viable alternative to using chemicals and can reduce the scale of costly emergency response activities to contain epidemics,"" said a 2013 ADB statement after the bank reviewed the impressive results of pilot projects in Kampong Cham province and neighboring Laos.<http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/26028/dengue-epidemic-looms/>[Maps of Cambodia can be seen at <http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Cambodia,_administrative_divisions_-_de_-_colored.svg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/145>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the past 50 years, the incidence of dengue worldwide has increased 30-fold, largely as a consequence of the growth of cities and increased travel. According to CDC, about 2.5 billion people, or 40 percent of the world's population, live in areas where there is a risk of dengue transmission. Dengue is endemic in at least 100 countries in Asia, the Pacific, the Americas, Africa, and the Caribbean. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 50 to 100 million infections occur yearly, including 500 000 DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever) cases and 22 000 deaths, mostly among children (<http://www.cdc.gov/Dengue/Epidemiology/index.html>).According to a 2013 WHO report, between 1955 and 1959, the number of countries reporting cases of dengue increased from 3 to 8; in 2012, the geographical distribution of dengue included more than 125 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there may be 50-100 million dengue infections worldwide every year. However, research in 2013 from the University of Oxford and the Wellcome Trust, using cartographic approaches, estimated there to be 390 million dengue infections per year worldwide (Bhatt S, Gething PW, Brady OJ, et al: The global distribution and burden of dengue.
