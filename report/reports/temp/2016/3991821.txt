Calgary Herald [edited]<http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/ahs-warns-of-sausage-link-to-e-coli-outbreak>Health officials say they've traced part of an _E. coli_ outbreak in Calgary to a meat retailer. At least 2 of 14 _E. coli_ infections have been attributed to Hungarian Farmer's Sausage sold by Paolini's Sausage and Meats Ltd., which should be treated as a raw product, says Alberta Health Services. Anyone who purchased the pork sausage prior to 2 Feb 2016 should cook it to an internal temperature of 71 deg C [160 deg F] to eliminate the dangerous bacteria.Sources for the other cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 haven't been conclusively detected, says AHS [Alberta Health Services]. The product might have been sold by other retailers in the city and outside it, they say.To reduce the risk of _E. coli_ infection, the public is also advised to wash hands with hot, soapy water and cleanse all kitchen surfaces and tools thoroughly. Fruits and vegetables should also be well-washed before eating.[Byline: Bill Kaufmann]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the scope and further workup of the source of this outbreak. Although classically associated with uncooked ground beef, a number of other sources including a variety of fresh produce, contaminated with the organism anywhere from the farm to the table, can be the source although pork products, unless cross-contaminated with uncooked beef, are unusual vehicles.The following is derived from Lutwick LI: Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting Emerging Zoonoses: The One Health Paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (eds) Springer, Tokyo, Japan, 2014, pp 77-112.""Unlike most of the animals that can carry EHEC without symptoms, porcine hosts develop ""edema disease"" related to EHEC enteric infection with organisms that produce Shiga toxin 2e. In Japan, the same level of carriage of _E. coli_ O157 exists in pigs as in cattle and such isolates can persist in swine. Ferens and Hovde postulate that swine may be an unlikely source of human EHEC infection because of their sensitivity to virulent Shiga toxin producing strains."" - Mod.LLIt is generally recommended to refrigerate meat and vegetables out of contact with each other to avoid cross-contamination. - Mod.JW]Maps of Canada can be seen at <https://canadaalive.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/canada_political_map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/273>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
