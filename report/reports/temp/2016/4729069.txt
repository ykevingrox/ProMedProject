This old elephant developed dysentery early in the morning and died in the afternoon, officials said.Though the real cause of the death of the 2 animals would be known only postmortem, it is suspected the elephant that died in MTR could have been suffering from anthrax, a highly infectious animal disease, prompting forest officials to take steps to shift the 23 elephants to nearby areas.A 26-year-old female had died in similar circumstances in the same camp last month [November 2016].As a preventive measure, MTR Field Director Srinivasa Reddy has taken steps to shift the remaining elephants from MTR to camps in Bombax and Foampuravayal, MTR Deputy Director S Saravanan said. Accordingly, 21 elephants would be moved to the camps immediately, and the 2 aged ones would be shifted later after reviewing their condition.The deaths of these elephants in MTR and Sirumugai are very similar to the deaths of 2 others that died in Madukkarai range in neighboring Coimbatore District after suffering from anthrax. These deaths were confirmed postmortem.The Coimbatore District administration has already taken steps to administer anti-anthrax vaccination to the cattle in and around Madukkarai area to prevent the spread of the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The previously reported case appears to have had a 2nd but unreported elephant dying of anthrax; see from 25 Dec 2016 ""Anthrax - India (29): (TN) elephant 20161225.4723282.""
