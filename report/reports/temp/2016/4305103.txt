Kazinform, International News Agency [edited]<http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2917475>The Karaganda Regional Veterinary Laboratory confirmed anthrax in a meat of a sick cow slaughtered by the resident of Yerkindik settlement in Shet district. The National Veterinary Reference Centre, will also announce its results soon, Kazinform reports.As earlier reported, state of emergency was declared in Yerkindik settlement for suspected anthrax outbreak. All required quarantine and prevention activities are underway.According to reports, the villager slaughtered the sick cow and gave its meat to neighbors and relatives. As the Regional Healthcare Department informed, 8 people including a 10-year-old child suspected of contamination with anthrax were taken to the Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital from [19 to 21 Jun 2016]. 2 of them -- a 33-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man -- died. All of them are residents of Yerkindik settlement.The head of the Karaganda Regional Veterinary Department Sayat Mussin gave a press conference today [22 Jun 2016] concerning the situation in the settlement. ""All the livestock in the village got an anthrax vaccine. And this cow was vaccinated too,"" he said and added that the animal could be immune-compromised after winter.Alongside, the specialists do not exclude other sources of infection, like animal burial sites. ""I think, in 2 or 3 days we will find out the source of infection,"" said Mussin. The last anthrax case in this area was registered in 1965, when one cow only got sick. As per archival data, 16 hotbeds of anthrax were revealed in Shet district from 1938 through 2003. ""The last case of contamination of an animal with anthrax in Karaganda region was revealed in 1988, in Ulytau district,"" S Mussin added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 23 Jun 2016 12:33Source: KazTag, The Kazakh Telegraph Agency [edited]<http://www.kaztag.kz/en/news/detail.php?ID=469281>All the cattle have been vaccinated for anthrax in Yerkindyk village, Karaganda region, said Sayat Mussin, deputy chief of regional veterinary department.""As of today [23 Jun 2016] the diagnosis of the regional veterinary laboratory shows that there is an anthrax germ, probably from vaccine. Vaccination was held in Yekindyk village on [30 Mar 2016] for the account of the Republican budget. All the cattle have been vaccinated for anthrax, including the cows,"" he said.According to the specialists the animal could have failed to get immunity. Meanwhile, the infection could have come from an animal burial site. ""We are seeking the source. I think we will know in 2-3 days,"" he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The usual reason for an anthrax vaccination failing is in dairy cows simultaneously receiving antibiotic treatment for mastitis. Sterne is a live strain and, like most, is susceptible to the usual antibiotics. We do see apparently problem vaccines in certain countries -- no names -- but these have a long history of the necessity for repeated vaccinations to get adequate immunity. Up until now the Kazakh vaccine has been a perfectly adequate single-shot vaccine. If it was not providing enough toxin stimulus this could be measured by too few repetitions of the toxin genes. The Kazakhs may be able to do this. They have received enough genomic training.The geographic distribution of the Kazakh strains of _Bacillus anthracis_ are well described and such a forensic/epidemiologic investigation would help show where this infection originated from in country; seeAikembayev A, et al: Historical distribution and molecular diversity of _Bacillus anthracis_ in Kazakhstan.

PLoS ONE 8(8): e72451. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072451; <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747089/>If it originated from an historic burial site -- they mention 16 such sites in the area dating up to 2003 -- 12 years is a mite long for a sudden reemergence, though not impossible. I would be more persuaded by a recent soil excavation in the area bringing buried spores up to the surface. But all in all an interesting situation to sort out. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53825>.]
