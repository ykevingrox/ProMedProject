Newsday reported that there have been 18 more recorded cases since the beginning of the month [August 2016], bringing the total to 36. The infection hasn't spread off the Barrier Island yet, officials have said.Mumps mainly affects children. According to the Centers for Disease Control, mumps typically causes fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and swollen and tender salivary glands. The swollen glands often give children a swollen, puffy face.It is spread through coughs or sneezes by infected people but can also be spread by sharing and touching objects an infected person has touched. It often starts spreading before the salivary glands swell, so a person with mumps might be spreading it before they know they have it.[Byline: Alex Costello]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
