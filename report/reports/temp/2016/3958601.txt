ProMED-mail would be interested to know, if these are cases are confirmed as YF, whether they involve the urban cycle of transmission. If so, there is a significant risk of further, rapid ongoing transmission if the population in this area has not been vaccinated previously. ProMED-mail would also be interested in the specific location and dates where and when the YF virus infections occurred, as well as information about the sex and ages of the victims. Is the YF vaccination campaign planned in the areas where the cases occurred or over a larger area?There was a suspected YF outbreak in Uige province in 2006. ProMED-mail was unable to learn if this outbreak was subsequently laboratory confirmed. - Mod.TYBecause YF vaccine needs 10 days to take effect, vaccination should be carried out in the area while waiting for confirmation from Dakar. - Mod.JWA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12461>.]
