The Telegraph [edited]<http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160724/jsp/northeast/story_98422.jsp#.V5aKo1dLWOo>The Manipur health department today [23 Jul 2016] confirmed an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in the state with the detection of 9 positive cases across 6 districts.Director of the health department Okram Ibomcha Singh said 9 positive cases had been confirmed so far, and more blood samples are being examined. He, however, clarified that the outbreak has not taken the form of an epidemic. The positive cases are reported from the districts of Thoubal, Imphal West, Churachandpur, Chandel, Ukhrul and Imphal East. One of the patients resides on the outskirts of Imphal city.Of the 9 patients, 8 are undergoing treatment at Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences and Regional Institute of Medical Sciences here free of cost, while the other patient is undergoing treatment at a hospital outside the state. Official sources said there are more suspected cases. The exact number of positive cases would be known after the laboratory test of the blood samples.Ibomcha said it was not wise for Japanese encephalitis patients to seek treatment at private hospitals.""All possible steps have been taken to control the spread of the virus causing the disease. There is no reason for panic. We are fighting the outbreak on a war footing,"" Ibomcha Singh said.The official said that 3000 vials or 15 000 doses of anti-Japanese encephalitis vaccine are in stock at present and 75 000 doses would be arriving in a few days to increase the stock.Fogging has already been initiated to kill mosquitoes within a 2-km radius of the localities from where the positive cases were reported.Manipur has experienced an outbreak of the disease in the past. According to official records, there were 200 cases in 1995; 50 affected people died that year. Out of 100 positive cases in 2010, 10 patients died. There were 9 positive cases last year [2015].Health minister D.K. Korungthan, accompanied by the health director, visited primary health centres yesterday [22 Jul 2016] located in Chandel district, one of the affected districts, and distributed anti-Japanese encephalitis vaccines. The team also supervised the ongoing fogging activities in the district.The health minister appealed to the people not to panic, assuring them the state government had taken all possible measures. He also advised people to protect themselves from mosquitoes.[Byline: Khelen Thokchom]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Odisha stateDate: Sun 24 Jul 2016Source: The New Indian Express [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Japanese-Encephalitis-virus-surfaces/2016/07/24/article3544622.ece>After the spurt in dengue cases in 24 districts of the state, Japanese encephalitis, a viral disease, has been detected in 3 villages under Brahmagiri block of Puri district.An expert team of the Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI) has visited the affected villages of Khilla Kanthia, Toranapada and Mulabari for surveillance on the disease in pigs.The team collected serum samples from 6 apparently healthy pigs, out of which 3 samples were found to be positive for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [antibodies] by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test at Bareilly-based Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI). In fact, pigs as well as certain wild birds (Heron) act as the carriers of JEV. There is no mortality in adult pigs except of reproductive symptoms like abortion, mummified foetus and still births, but in piglets, mortality may go up to 100 percent. From these carriers, the disease is transmitted not by contact but by the vector mosquitoes (species in the genus _Culex_ and _Aedes_), which are usually active during dusk and dawn.""That's why vector control has much importance to prevent the transmission of virus from pig to pig and pig to human. Pigs may be reared away from human habitation to minimise the chance of human infection,"" stated an ADRI official.Japanese encephalitis is caused by a mosquito-borne virus. This disease is mostly seen in humans during the mosquitoes' breeding season. Now nearly 18 states have recorded JEV and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), which have high mortality and morbidity rates.In Odisha, the 1st outbreak was reported in 2012 in Malkangiri district. At least 24 children had died in Potrel and Uskapalli villages under Chitrakonda tehsil and Pradhaniguda and Charkiguda villages under Malkangiri tehsil.There is no vaccine [not accurate; there is a JEV vaccine that is widely used in India. - Mod.TY] and specific anti-viral medicine available against JEV in humans. The cases are managed symptomatically. Clinical management is supportive, and acute care is directed at maintaining fluid, electrolyte balance and control of convulsions, if present. Maintenance of airway is crucial.The preventive measures are directed at reducing the vector density and in taking personal protection against mosquito bites using insecticide treated mosquito nets. The reduction in mosquito breeding requires eco-management, as the role of insecticides is limited.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, where the JE virus transmission season is beginning. Fogging is not an effective long-term approach to JE prevention; vaccination is.It is odd that Manipur has an active JE vaccination initiative yet the Odisha health authorities indicate incorrectly that there is no vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure. Vector control may provide short-term mosquito population reduction but is not a long-term preventive measure. Extensive rice fields and other wetlands offer ample breeding sites. The Odisha report mentions acute encephalitis syndrome, some cases of which are due to JE virus infections, and several other etiologies have been proposed for other AES cases.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306>. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Manipur State, India: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/311>Odisha State, India: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>]
