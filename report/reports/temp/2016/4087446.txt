The Navhind Times [edited]<http://www.navhindtimes.in/another-sattari-woman-dies-of-monkey-fever/>A 50-year-old woman, who had been suffering from Kyasanur Forest disease [KFD] or monkey fever, died on Wednesday evening [9 Mar 2016] at the Goa Medical College [GMC], Bambolim. This is the 3rd death linked to KFD this year [2016]. On 2 Mar [2016], the woman, from Mauxi village [Sattari taluka, Goa state], was admitted to the community health centre, Valpoi, and she was diagnosed of monkey fever by a Manipal virology team.When her condition worsened doctors referred her to the GMC on 7 Mar [2016] for further treatment. However, she did not respond to the treatment and breathed her last breath on Wednesday.Since the last year [2015] the Kyasanur Forest disease has claimed 7 lives; this year till now 3 women passed away due to KFD.Though all the 7 people had KFD symptoms, the state government has maintained that these deaths in Sattari taluka are not entirely due to the Kyasanur Forest disease. However, reports from Manipal virology centre confirmed that 4 persons had tested positive to KFD.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) cases occurred in Goa in 2015 and are continuing into 2016, with this as the latest case. The situation where she acquired her infection is not stated.As noted in the previous posts, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case fatality rate is 3-5 per cent (see the CDC fact sheet at <http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html>).Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although monitoring ticks for KFD virus provides information for issuing alerts, the only means for prevention of infection is avoidance of tick bites.Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf>).Maps of India showing the location of Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala, the states where KFD virus is endemic and cases have been occurring over the last year, can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/states/> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/301>. - Mod.TY]
