The _E. coli_ bacterium carried a gene making it resistant to the antibiotic colistin, the drug used against particularly dangerous types of superbugs that can already withstand many other antibiotics.The sample is still undergoing analysis. The bacteria were detected [27 May 2016], nearly 2 months after the 1st discovery of the gene in a pig sample. USDA officials have provided few details, including where either animal was raised or killed.The same gene, _mcr-1_, also was identified last month [May 2016] in an _E. coli_ strain from a 49-year-old Pennsylvania woman with no recent travel outside the country. That marked the 1st time the colistin-resistant strain had been found in a person in the United States, raising alarms among health officials and infectious-disease experts tracking its appearance in Asia, Europe, and Canada.Each of the 3 US cases involves different strains of _E. coli_. The latest animal case suggests the gene is already circulating through multiple routes here.""Mounting evidence suggests the mcr-1 gene is circulating within the United States,"" said Patrick McGann, one of the Defense Department researchers who identified the gene in the patient in Pennsylvania. ""Our sample was in a woman with no recent travel history, the pig samples are from slaughterhouses in the USA, and [the] strains are all different."" But the sources have yet to be identified, McGann said.US officials have been looking for the gene since its emergence in pigs and people in China was reported late last year [2015]. There have since been dozens more reports in animals and people on 3 continents. The number of positive cases in animals is about 20 times that in humans, so researchers say it's not that surprising that 2 pig samples have tested positive in the United States.Public health officials' biggest fear is that the gene will spread to bacteria that are now susceptible only to colistin. In all 3 cases here, the gene was carried on a plasmid, a mobile piece of DNA that easily can transfer the gene to other bacteria. That would result in a kind of super-superbug, invincible to every life-saving antibiotic available.In prepared testimony for a congressional hearing [Tue 14 Jun 2016] on antibiotic resistance, a top expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is essential to slow the spread of resistant bacteria.[Byline: Lena H Sun]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 3rd identification of the _mcr-1_ gene in the US and the 2nd in a pig in the US. The _mcr-1_ encodes resistance to colistin. Because the _mcr-1_ gene is located on a plasmid, it is capable of horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria of the same or even different species, and is frequently linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other antibiotics.
