More than 70 per cent of the patients are small children aged 1-3 years.Minister of Public Health MD Piyaskol Skolsattayathorn on [Sun 3 Jul 2016] said there were more than 20 000 hand-foot-mouth disease patients in 77 provinces from 1 Jan-June this year [2016] with a death toll of one. Most of the patients were in the northern region, followed by the central, northern, and southern regions respectively.The ministry instructed the provincial public health offices nationwide to ask child development centers and kindergartens in their area to continuously control the disease in order to prevent more infections.The best way to prevent the hand-foot-mouth disease is to keep oneself clean and wash hands often, especially after using the toilette and before eating, said MD Piyaskol.Hand-foot-mouth disease is caused by enterovirus. Patients will have a fever and sores in or on the mouth and on the hands and feet.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In Thailand, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is usually caused by enterovirus 71 or coxsackievirus A16. During a large outbreak in 2012, it was determined from patient specimens that coxsackievirus A6 was the causative agent.Coxsackievirus A6 (CAV6) is 1 of 10 genotypes within the family _Picornaviridae_, genus _Enterovirus_, species _Human enterovirus A_. Other genotypes include coxsackievirus A16 (CAV16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71). Although CAV6 is commonly associated with hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina, it had not been of concern until the 2012 global outbreaks of HFMD.In Thailand, HFMD usually occurs during the rainy season (June-August); average incidence during 2007-2011 was 20.2 cases per 100 000 population. In 2012, an extensive outbreak of HFMD occurred; the incidence rate was 3-fold higher than the average incidence rate of 58.15 cases per 100 000 population or more than 36 000 cases; the 2012 outbreak included 2 fatal cases of EV71 encephalitis.Generally, the clinical manifestations of HFMD were fever; drooling, and refusal to eat (among young children); painful lesions in the mouth, especially on the soft palate; and vesicular rashes on the palms and feet.Excerpted fromPuenpa J, Chieochansin T, Linsuwanon P, et al: Hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6, Thailand, 2012.
