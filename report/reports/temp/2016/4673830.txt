Incubation period: legionnaires' disease normally takes between 2 and 10 days to develop symptoms (typically 5 to 6 days) and Pontiac fever between 24-48 hours. Epidemiological evidence [usually] supports airborne transmission through contaminated aerosolized water particles. _Legionella_'s reservoirs are showers, air conditioning cooling towers, evaporative condensers, humidifiers, spas, respiratory therapy devices and decorative fountains. Risk factors for illness include increasing age (most cases are over 50 years), cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, renal disease, malignancy and compromised immunity, particularly patients who are receiving corticosteroids or who have had an organ transplant.The Public Health Agency of Aragon has identified 4 cases of a travel-associated [legionellosis] cluster in Zaragoza (in Aragon, in northern Spain). There are 4 affected patients, 3 female and 1 male, and their ages range from 65 to 68 years. 3 cases presented with clinical signs of [legionnaires' disease, i.e.,] pneumonia, compatible radiography and positive urinary antigen test [for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1]. 1 case presented with clinical signs of Pontiac fever. 2 patients were admitted to hospital, and the other 2 patients have been given treatment to take at home. 1 patient is still hospitalized; 1 was discharged. There are no deceased.They all stayed at the same hotel in Cuzco (Peru) between 12 Oct and 12 Nov 2016.In response to the cluster, the Public Health Agency of Aragon has reported through the Epidemiological Surveillance Network (Spain) and the European Network for Legionellosis Surveillance (ELDSNET). The epidemiological alert was set from Aragon last 22 Nov 2016 after 2 first cases were identified.The usual source for cases associated with hotels is the warm water in guest rooms (showers emit contaminated aerosolized water particles). Legionnaires' disease associated with travel is an important issue [1].[1.] de Jong B, Payne HallstrÌ¦m L, Robesyn E, Ursut D, Zucs P, on behalf of ELDSNet (European Legionnaires' Disease Surveillance Network).

Available online: <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20498>.--Amaya Aznar BriebaGobierno de Aragon<aaznarb@aragon.es>[ProMED-mail thanks Amaya Aznar Brieba for submitting this travel-associated outbreak of legionellosis. According to the U.S. CDC, about 20-25 percent of all legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5648a2.htm> and <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/conveyance-transportation-issues/cruise-ship-travel>). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in other travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. Cases of travel-associated legionnaires' disease need to be reported to the appropriate authorities to be able to detect these outbreaks. We are not told if there were any other guests at the hotel in Peru, perhaps from other countries, who developed legionellosis, if cultures for _Legionella_ were obtained from possible water sources at the hotel, the results of these cultures, and if consequent remediation was done to prevent legionellosis from developing in future guests at the hotel. More information in this regard would be appreciated.Aragon, located in northeastern Spain on the border with France, is an autonomous community in Spain, with 3 provinces (from north to south): Huesca, Zaragoza, and Teruel; its capital is Zaragoza (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragon>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4503>.][See Also:Legionellosis - Spain (02): (CT) fatal, hotel 20161008.45458402015----Legionellosis - France: (LR) RFI 20150913.3641760Legionellosis - Portugal: (PO) 20150912.36402162012----Legionellosis - USA (05): (PA) hotel 20120913.1293109Legionellosis - USA (04): (IL) fatal, more cases, hotel fountain 20120901.1276694Legionellosis - USA (03): (IL) hotel 20120823.1259486Legionellosis - Spain (05): (MD) restaurant 20120706.1192385Legionellosis - Spain (04): (AN), hotel 20120211.1038953Legionellosis - Spain (03): (AN) hotel 20120210.1037995Legionellosis - USA: (NY) hotel 20120205.1033536Legionellosis - Spain (02): (AN) hotel 20120203.1031069Legionellosis - Spain: (AN) hotel 20120122.10180772011----Legionellosis - USA (05): (MD) fatal, hotel 20111014.3073Legionellosis - USA (03): (NV) hotel 20110716.2159Legionellosis, hotel - UK (03): (Scotland) 20110408.1100Legionellosis, hotel - UK (02): (Scotland) background 20110328.0974Legionellosis, hotel - UK: (Scotland) 20110327.0965Legionellosis, hotel - Mexico: (QR) alert 20110121.02532010----Legionellosis - Spain (05): Madrid 20101115.4142].................................................ml/je/ml/je/dk"
