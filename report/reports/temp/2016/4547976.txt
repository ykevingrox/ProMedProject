KMVT [edited]<http://www.kmvt.com/content/news/Twin-Falls-County-resident-is-receiving-treatment-for-rabies-after-exposure-to-a-bat-395318241.html>A Twin Falls County [Idaho] resident is currently receiving treatment after an encounter with an aggressive bat. According to Tanis Maxwell, an epidemiologist with South Central Public Health District, ""On [Mon 26 Sept 2016], the individual was working in the Mini-Cassia area [Cassia and Minidoka counties] when the encounter occurred."" The individual is receiving treatment [post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). - Mod.TG] through a local medical facility.The bat was captured and sent to the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories for testing. On [Wed 28 Sep 2016], the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories sent the results to Maxwell. ""The bat tested positive for rabies,"" Maxwell said. Since June [2016], 19 animals statewide have tested positive for rabies. This is the 1st animal in south central Idaho to test positive for rabies, since June.Rabies can only be confirmed in a laboratory, however any bat that is active by day or is found in a place where bats are not usually seen (for example, in a room in your home or on the lawn), or is unable to fly is far more likely than others to be rabid. Such bats are often the most easily approached. Therefore, it is best never to handle any bat. If an individual is scratched or bitten, they should receive medical attention as soon as possible. Maxwell noted, ""An untreated rabies infection is virtually always fatal.""The health district urges residents to avoid contact with bats. To protect yourself and your pets:- do not touch a bat with your bare hands;- if you have an encounter with a bat, seek medical attention immediately;- if safe to do so, capture the bat and save it in a container without touching it. Then contact South Central Public Health District to arrange for testing. There is no charge for this service;- always vaccinate your pets, including horses. Pets may encounter bats outdoors or in the home;- plug all holes in your cabin or home. Pay attention to gaps in the siding and maintain tight-fitting screens on windows and vents.Not all bats have rabies, but the department encourages people to look for bats behaving oddly. That could be something as simple as seeing them during the day. ""Bats are normally nocturnal and if they come out during the day it is an indication of acting abnormal,"" said Tanis Maxwell, the program health manager. ""So you always want to watch for abnormal behavior or anything that is out of the ordinary.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state Idaho of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40853>.

A kitten found 3 weeks ago in Peculiar tested positive for the virus, the department said in a release. Exposed people are currently being treated to prevent rabies after being bitten by the kitten, and the department urges anyone with exposure to stray kittens or cats in the area of 227th Street and Knight Terrace in Peculiar to seek medical attention.Rabies is a rare but deadly virus. Just one case of a person with rabies was reported in 2015 in the United States, according to the Mayo Clinic.Rabies is primarily transferred through bites. Clinical signs in animals include unusual behavior, disorientation, staggering, excessive salivation, and aggressive behavior. The health department encourages citizens who see animals displaying such behavior to contact law enforcement and notify the health department as soon as possible.The health department also provided the following tips to prevent rabies:- ensure dogs, cats, and ferrets are up-to-date on rabies vaccinations. The effectiveness of animal vaccines is the main reason for the nationwide decline in rabies cases among people and domestic animals;- keep pets under control; do not allow them to run loose;- avoid contact with stray pets and wild animals; do not keep wild animals as pets;- report wild animals exhibiting unusual behavior or stray pets to law enforcement officials;- personal pets should not be handled without protection directly after being exposed to wildlife due to the potential for carrying residual saliva from the infected animal.[byline: Max Londberg]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Missouri can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55935>.

Unvaccinated pets that are exposed to a rabid animal are euthanized. What heartbreak to the family or person who could have saved their pet by having it vaccinated.People should be aware that post exposure prophylaxis is expensive. Some places charge in the thousands of dollars for the series. There are a variety of rules for people with known bites versus those with possible exposure <http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/index.html>.Rabies is a serious disease and should not be taken lightly in animals or people. - Mod.TG]
