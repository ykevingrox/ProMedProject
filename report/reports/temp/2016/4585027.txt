The New Indian Express, Express News Service [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2016/oct/25/encephalitis-spread-under-control-central-team-1531513.html>Even as Japanese encephalitis (JE) is haunting the [Odisha] State administration for the last more than a month and kids affected with the disease continue to die, a Central team that visited Malkangiri district to take stock of the situation, on [Mon 24 Oct 2016], said the prevalence rate of the deadly virus is steadily coming down.Joint director of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr Kalpana Baruah, who led the 6-member team, said the disease has been brought under control. ""Now there are sporadic cases of the disease. The situation has improved,"" she told reporters after a meeting with Health and Family Welfare Minister Pradip Amat.The Central team had visited the worst-hit areas and interacted with affected people. Baruah said the State Government has taken every possible step to curb outbreak of the vector-borne disease. The district administration is doing a good job as well. Not only Malkangiri, the district administration of Koraput has also taken adequate measures to prevent the disease, she said. On mass vaccination, Dr Baruah said, the decision will be taken at a joint meeting next month [November 2016].""However, there will be a training programme for health staff before vaccination starts. The training programme will be conducted in the 2nd week of November [2016],"" she said and added that the State will be provided one crore [10 million] long-lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN) in December.The Central team has collected samples of patients, which will be sent for tests. The team toured the district for 3 days to review the measures taken by the State administration after the outbreak of JE. The team had visited Palakonda, Babli, and Koimetol villages and a few hospitals. They had also visited the district headquarters hospital to inspect health condition of patients and held talks with the hospital staff.On [Mon 24 Oct 2016], one more child succumbed to the disease taking the death toll to 66 in 45 days. The deceased was identified as a 5-year-old boy of Barajaguda village. He died while undergoing treatment in the district headquarters hospital at Malkangiri.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The fatal case count for this outbreak has been a bit confusing. The report above indicates that there are 66 fatalities from JE virus infections. A 23 Oct 2016 report published in The Times of India (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20161024.4579882) indicated that the unofficial number of fatalities was 68. A report in the 25 Oct 2016 issue of the New Indian Express (<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2016/oct/25/onenbspjapanese-encephalitisnbspdeath-in-48-hours-at-malkangiri-1531546.html>) indicated that there have been 61 fatalities.The report above is the 1st one we have seen that indicates that a vaccination campaign against JE is being considered. As of late September 2016, 14 children had died. It is not clear why vaccination was not considered much earlier on, given that mosquito vector control is difficult and not long-lasting. Bed nets have been distributed, which will provide some protection from mosquito bites. Immunity from vaccination provides the best barrier to JE virus infection.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]
