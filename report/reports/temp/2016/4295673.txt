Temas de Salud [in Spanish, trans. machine & Mod.TY, edited]<http://temas.sld.cu/vigilanciaensalud/2016/06/14/confirman-un-caso-fatal-por-fiebre-amarilla-en-colombia/>It was confirmed that the case of yellow fever [YF] this year [2016] in Colombia was traveling in [a yellow fever virus] endemic forested area in the department of Meta, located in the central region of the country.This fatal case, reported by the municipal Secretary of Health, was a 28-year-old military man from the Macarena municipality; he was treated at the military Hospital and then referred to the Meta Clinic, where he died.Before his death, health authorities declared an epidemiological alert in the 29 municipalities and they invited the inhabitants to get vaccinated for free as the only [preventive] solution.Yellow fever is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito that has previously been infected, mainly from some species of monkeys that live in the forest.People sick [in the viremic phase of a YF virus infection] who go to urban areas seeking help, can infect the mosquito that lives in houses and these in turn infect other unvaccinated healthy people. This is the greatest risk of epidemic disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The tropical forested areas of Colombia are endemic for YF virus, and spill-over from monkeys to humans via forest mosquitoes in the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle occurs sporadically. It seems odd that a soldier in Meta department was not vaccinated previously. It is interesting that no mention is made of the deaths of YF virus infected monkeys in the forest where the soldier was exposed, which is often the indicator of circulation of the virus in the area.Maps of Colombia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/southamerica/map-of-Colmbia.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/27576>. - Mod.TY]
