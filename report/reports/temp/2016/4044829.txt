Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) press release [edited]<http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201602/23/P201602230779.htm>The Controller of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH), Dr Leung Ting-hung, announced today (23 Feb 2016) the investigation into the 1st imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong this winter [2015-16] and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.""Due to the seasonal pattern, our risk assessment shows that the activity of avian influenza viruses is expected to remain at a high level in winter months. In view of this sporadic case, the public, particularly travellers and those who may visit the Mainland, should heighten vigilance. Do not visit poultry markets and farms. Avoid poultry contact,"" Dr Leung said at a briefing this evening [23 Feb 2016].The male patient, aged 60 with good past health, lives and works in Suzhou, Jiangsu. He came to Hong Kong on 5 Feb [2016] and reported onset of fever, chills, rigor, cough and shortness of breath since 8 Feb [2016]. He consulted a private doctor on 10 and 11 Feb [2016] who referred him to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (PYNEH) for management on 11 Feb [2016]. Upon admission and laboratory testing by PYNEH, his specimen collected on 12 Feb [2016] preliminarily tested negative for influenza A. He was discharged on 15 Feb [2016]. Clinical diagnosis was pneumonia, and he has been in stable condition all along.The man subsequently sought advice from another private doctor on 18 and 22 Feb [2016]. Further testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch on his specimens taken on 12 Feb [2016] returned a result that was today [23 Feb 2016] confirmed as being positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. He has been admitted to the Hospital Authority Infectious Disease Centre (HAIDC) in Princess Margaret Hospital today for further management.The patient visited a wet market near his residence in Suzhou in which he reported no poultry contact.Initial enquiries revealed the patient's afebrile son with sore throat since 22 Feb [2016], who has also been admitted to the HAIDC for observation this evening [23 Feb 2016]. To date, his wife has remained asymptomatic, while tracing of the patient's other close contacts in Hong Kong is ongoing.""The case will be notified to the World Health Organization and the National Health and Family Planning Commission. We are communicating with the Mainland health authority to follow up on the patient's exposure and movements in the Mainland. Based on information available thus far, it is classified as an imported case. Investigations are ongoing,"" Dr Leung said.Letters to doctors, hospitals, kindergartens, child care centres and primary and secondary schools as well as residential care homes for the elderly and the disabled will be issued to alert them to the latest situation.This is the 14th imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed in Hong Kong. Since March 2013 to date, 707 cases have been reported in the Mainland, while from October 2015, 50 have been reported.The DH's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.The display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers are underway. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:- Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;- If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;- Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;- Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian influenza A (H7N9) is an influenza (flu) virus found in birds that does not normally infect humans. However, in spring of 2013, China began reporting infections with the virus in people. Most of these infections have been associated with contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets) in China. - Mod.LK]******[2] WHO Outbreaks and emergencies H7N9Date: 12 Feb 2016Source: WHO Situation update as of 12 Feb 2016 [edited]<http://www.wpro.who.int/outbreaks_emergencies/H7N9/en/>From 5 to 11 Feb 2016, 28 new cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus from the Western Pacific Region were reported. The last case was reported on 5 Feb 2016. Onset dates ranged from 21 Dec 2015 to 25 Jan 2016. Cases ranged in age from 14 to 91 years, with a median age of 58 years. Of these 28 cases, 18 (64 per cent) were male. The majority (25 cases, 89 per cent) reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; the exposure history of 3 cases is unknown or no clear exposure to poultry. No clusters were reported. Cases were reported from 6 provinces and municipalities: Zhejiang (13), Jiangsu (5), Guangdong (4), Fujian (3), Shanghai (2) and Hunan (1). See URL for individual case information.WHO is continuing to assess the epidemiological situation and will conduct further risk assessments with new information. Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses has not changed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely, as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Research: Epidemiology and virology of H7N9 infectionsDate: 18 Feb 2016Source: Arch Virol [edited]<http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-016-2781-3>Sha J, Chen X, Ren Y. Differences in the epidemiology and virology of mild, severe and fatal human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. Arch Virol. 2016 Feb 18. [Epub ahead of print]Abstract-------A novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus caused 5-10 per cent mild and 30.5 per cent fatal human infections as of 10 Dec 2015. In order to investigate the reason for the higher rate of fatal outcome of this infection, this study compared the molecular epidemiology and virology of avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses from mild (N = 14), severe (N = 50) and fatal (N = 35) cases, as well as from non-human hosts (N = 73). The epidemiological results showed that the average age of the people in the mild, severe and fatal groups was 27.6, 52 and 62 years old, respectively (p under 0.001). Males accounted for 42.9 per cent (6/14), 58.0 per cent (29/50), and 74.3 per cent (26/35) of cases in the mild, severe and fatal group respectively (p = 0.094). Median days from onset to start of antiviral treatment were 2, 5 and 7 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p = 0.002). The median time from onset to discharge/death was 12, 40 and 19 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p under 0.001). Analysis of whole genome sequences showed that PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations were markedly associated with an increased fatality rate, while HA (N276D) and PB2 (N559T) mutations were clearly related to mild cases. There were no differences in the genotypes, adaptation to mammalian hosts, and genetic identity between the 3 types of infection. In conclusion, advanced age and delayed confirmation of diagnosis and antiviral intervention were risk factors for death. Furthermore, PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations might contribute to a fatal outcome in human H7N9 infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The study concluded that advanced age as well as a delay in confirmation of diagnosis and start of antiviral treatment were the greatest contributory factors to a high risk of death, but the mutations observed were associated with increased fatality rate. Because a vaccine is not available, it is critical that surveillance be conducted to identify genetic changes that may lead to person-to-person transmission.Maps of China can be found at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Mod.LK]
