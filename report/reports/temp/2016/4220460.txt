EpiCore Surveillance Project [edited]The information [contained in the post] is correct. cVDPV 2 has been obtained from environmental surveillance in Borno state where I am based. Borno is targetted with immunization activities to leave no child missed.--EpiCore Surveillance Project memberProf. Marycelin BabaWHO Polio Lab******[2]Date: Thu 12 May 2016Source: EpiCore Surveillance Project [edited]The response to the environmental cVDPV2 outbreak in Borno state, northern Nigeria is proposed as follows:1. The 1st outbreak response is ongoing; 9-12 May 2016. The plan is to vaccinate children less than 5 years in all the 27 local government areas (LGAs) in Borno state, and some LGAs in bordering states of Gombe (6 LGAs), Yobe (4 LGAs) and Adamawa (2 LGAs) with mOPV2 [monovalent OPV type 2].2. The 2nd outbreak response is scheduled for 13-18 Jun 2016. The plan is to vaccinate children less than 5 years in all the 27 LGAs in Borno state, 6 LGAs in Gombe state, 4 LGAs in Yobe state, and 2 LGAs in Adamawa state with IPV and mOPV2.3. The 3rd outbreak response is planned for 11-14 Jul 2016. This is in all the 27 LGAs, 6 LGAs in Gombe, 4 LGAs in Yobe and 2LGAs in Adamawa state using mOPV2 targetting children less than 5 years of age.As of today [12 May 2016], the campaign is still ongoing and it will continue tomorrow [13 May 2016] and Saturday [14 May 2016] as a mop up campaign targetting non-compliant/rejection households and making revisits to capture children not met at home during the exercise.This is a proposal and may be changed for some reasons.--EpiCore Surveillance Project memberDr Jibrin Manu IdrisMaiduguri, Nigeria******[3] Date: Thu 12 May 2016Source: EpiCore Surveillance Project [edited]The bivalent OPV has already been launched and began [9 May 2016]; however, due to logistic delay, the immunization process started in earnest [10 May 2016] here in all local governments [LGAs] of Borno state; we are glad for the response of all stakeholders, including the local governments.The [vaccine] distribution began from the federal level (National Program for Immunization [NPI]) office to the state NPI office, then to the local government, [at which point] the staff take the campaign house to house [to vaccinate all eligible children]. However, some LGAs started on [9 May 2016], but most of the southern Borno LGAs started on 10 May 2016.This campaign would end 13 May 2016. This is in response to the strain of the polio virus [cVDPV2] seen in the Maiduguri metropolitan area.--EpiCore Surveillance Project memberDr George M.D.Tropical Medicine PhysicianBiu General HospitalBiu, Borno, Nigeria******[4]Date: 12-13 May 2016Source: EpiCore Surveillance Project [edited]Other responses from EpiCore Surveillance Project members:- 1st response received following RFI: I can confirm that an environmental sample from Maiduguri, Borno state, Nigeria was positive for cVDPV; presently mop up immunization campaign is going on in Borno state along with states sharing [the] border.- 2nd and 3rd response received: I can confirm to you that Nigeria is conducting the SNID [subnational immunization days] for poliomyelitis in the North [of Nigeria].The date has also been confirmed to be from 14 May 2016 (Saturday) to 17 May 2016 (Tuesday) using mOPV2.As it is, participants will proceed to the field tomorrow [13 May 2016] and for briefing and commence the activity on Saturday [14 May 2016].However, Borno state will not been involved, as I have been informed that the activity has been carried out (commenced in the state last weekend and is being concluded now).- Another response:Borno state will participate in the planned 14-17 May 2016. The outbreak response started on [9 May 2016] and will last for 4 days in the 4 participating states: namely Borno, Yobe, Adamawa and Gombe. Some Local Government Areas in Yobe and Adamawa state that did not participate in the outbreak response, because of security issues, would implement the May Immunization Plus Days as scheduled (14-17 May 2016). The 2nd and 3rd responses will take place on 13-18 Jun 2016 and 11-14 Jul 2016 respectively. mOPV2 will be used for 1st and 3rd responses, while IPV + mOPV2 will be used for the 2nd response.- Another response: The outbreak response immunization using monovalent type 2 is going on from 10-12 May 2016 in Northern Borno. However, for Southern Borno it started on 11 May 2016 and ends on 13 May 2016 along with local government areas of Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe states surrounding Borno. Borno state is not going to participate in the May 2016 NIPDS.- Another response:The SIAs were held in Borno state from [9-12 May 2016] with mop up campaigns planned for [13-14 May 2016]. The next campaign will be in June [2016] with a subsequent one planned for July 2016. Currently there are no plans to hold SIAs in next week in Borno.--EpiCore Surveillance Project members requesting confidentiality[The responses provided by the EpiCore Surveillance Project members were excellent, helping to clarify the planned control measures in response to the cVDPV2 isolated from an environmental sample in Maiduguri, Borno state, Nigeria. We await results over the coming months to see if the novel approach using mOPV2 is successful in interrupting the transmission and circulation of this cVDPV2 in Nigeria.A map of Nigeria showing states can be found at: <http://www.mapsofworld.com/nigeria/nigeria-political-map.html>.
