The Express Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1274991/no-preventive-measures-chikungunya-outbreak-traced-back-india/>Epidemiologists have linked the outbreak of chikungunya in Karachi [Sindh] with its outbreak in India a few months ago. Chikungunya was notified for the 1st time by the National Institute of Health (NIH) after 3 patients were tested positive for this mosquito-borne disease.Epidemiologists said that NIH had issued an alert in October [2016] after the chikungunya outbreak in India, but no preventive measures were taken at airports, railway stations, or the Pakistan-India border.A senior epidemiologist, working closely with the NIH, said: ""There are chances that an infected person or mosquitoes traveled to Pakistan, thereby becoming the potential source of its spread,"" he said. He said that there was a likelihood that the disease would spread to other parts of the country.He warned that there were chances of an outbreak in areas where the temperature was still high. ""Tharparkar [Sindh] is highly vulnerable and there are chances that the infection entered Pakistan from this side,"" said Prof Dr Muhammad Saleem Rana, the senior vector control expert at Lahore's Contech School of Public Health.""The high number of cases emerging from India should have served as warning but no preventive measures were taken,"" he said.[Byline: Sehrish Wasif]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] More casesDate: Mon 26 Dec 2016 12:48 PM PKTSource: Dunya News [edited]<http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/367164-Chikungunya-continues-to-terrorize-people-of-Malir>Chikungunya is continuing to be a terror for the people of Malir [Karachi, Sindh] as patients keep on coming in Saudabad hospital. The Health Department has advised people to take precautionary measures and not worry about the disease.Doctors are busy in attending patients while the blood samples of patients are being taken for tests. Meanwhile, Health Department has displayed banners for the awareness of people regarding chikungunya.According to Saudabad Hospital's Dr Fakhar, the disease should be eliminated by destroying its root. He said chikungunya is different from dengue but is being [transmitted by the same mosquitoes]. He advised the people to take precautionary measures whereas he has also directed the patients to drink maximum water.Doctors said that suspected chikungunya fever patients are coming on daily basis but the number has descended notably.Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease first described during an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1952. It is an RNA virus that belongs to the _Alphavirus_ genus of the family _Togaviridae_. The name ""chikungunya"" derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning ""to become contorted"", and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain (arthralgia).Chikungunya is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain. Other common signs and symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash.The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually lasts for a few days or may be prolonged to weeks. Hence the virus can cause acute, subacute, or chronic disease.Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years. Occasional cases of eye, neurological, and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death. Often symptoms in infected individuals are mild and the infection may go unrecognized, or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue occurs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above indicates that the number of clinical cases has decreased over the last few days.
