According to witnesses, 3 youths were seriously injured (1 shot in the head and another in the leg; all 3 were hospitalized) in altercations with police in Sierra Leone after authorities ordered village traders to close shops while they hunted for people who may have had contact with an Ebola virus disease (EVD) victim. Reports indicate angry youths allegedly burned down a police post in the northern village of Barmoi Luma, as police fired tear gas to disperse angry crowds.According to authorities, the trouble started Sat 23 Jan 2016 when 30 local people were quarantined for having potentially had contact with the latest outbreak's index case, who died from EVD on 12 Jan 2016. Approximately 50 others who may have come in contact with this case went into hiding in the community, which is deeply suspicious of western treatments for EVD.A town chief told AFP that police in Barmoi Luma had ordered market traders to halt business and shops to close from Sat [23 Jan 2016] ""to minimize any risk of contact with the runaway contacts,"" and they had remained shuttered. ""This has angered residents who said the actions of the police were arbitrary since the deceased did not die in Barmoi Luma but in Magburaka,"" he said.][It will be difficult, but necessary, to instill trust so that effective control measures can be implemented and followed by all members of the community. - Mod.LK]27 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone: Ebola -- Arik resumes flights to Freetown<http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/general/ebola-arik-resumes-flights-to-freetown/130944.html>[Arik Air has resumed flight services from Lagos to Freetown, Sierra Leone beginning from 23 Feb 2016.

According to the committee (consisting of members of the UK parliament) in its report, the UK is not prepared for an outbreak because of a ""lack of capacity to manufacture vaccines places the UK in a vulnerable position when the next epidemic strikes."" Among the steps the committee is recommending is the UK government's negotiate with private pharmaceutical companies to keep stockpiles of vaccines in the UK which would be ready for immediate clinical trials, and would be instantly available to access upon an outbreak.Funding-----------  25 Jan 2016: Russia donates mobile Ebola lab to Guinea <https://www.rt.com/business/330054-russia-ebola-laboratory-guinea/>[As part of a project financed by Russian aluminum producer Rusal, Russia donated a new mobile laboratory for diagnosing disease caused by Ebola virus (EVD) and other viruses.
