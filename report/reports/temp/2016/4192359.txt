CTV News [edited]<http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/tropical-parasite-emerges-in-indigenous-communities-in-far-north-1.2878669>Canadian researchers have discovered an intestinal parasite known as _Cryptosporidium_ for the 1st time in a remote community in the Arctic.The potentially dangerous parasite was found in Nunavik, in Quebec's far north.A team from the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre [MUHC] made the find after examining an outbreak of intestinal illnesses in 10 Indigenous villages between April 2013 and April 2014.The researchers were able to identify the parasite as _Cryptosporidium hominis_, a strain of the protozoa that is normally found in tropical countries. _Cryptosporidium_ lives in the intestine of mammals, including humans, and is typically spread by drinking water contaminated with feces.The resulting illness, called cryptosporidiosis or simply ""crypto"", causes diarrhea, cramps, and vomiting that can last for weeks and that can be fatal to young children and those with weakened immune systems.The discovery is worrisome, says the study's senior author, Dr CÌ©dric Yansouni, who is associate director of the JD MacLean Centre for Tropical Diseases at MUHC. That's because _Cryptosporidium_ illness could have long-term implications on the health of children in Nunavik as well as in nearby Nunavut.""We are being particularly vigilant because it is known in low-income countries that repeated _Cryptosporidium_ infections can cause growth delays and difficulty at school in children,"" he said in a statement.""In the Nunavik outbreak, children under the age of 5 were the group most affected by the infection.""There is a treatment for cryptosporidiosis that is readily available in countries where _Cryptosporidium_ is common, but it is only available in Canada under a special access program._Cryptosporidium_ outbreaks are rare in most of Canada. In 2001, more than 7000 residents of North Battleford, Saskatchewan became sick when _Cryptosporidium_ entered the city's water supply during routine maintenance of a chemical filter.In 1997, there was an outbreak in Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, which straddles the Ontario-Manitoba boundary. The community has been under a boil-water advisory ever since.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It must be a mistake that _Cryptosporidium_ spp. is labeled as a tropical parasite. Indeed it has been described from Scandinavia including Iceland, Canada, Alaska, and northern Russia (Akuffo H, et al: Parasites of the Colder Climates. Taylor & Francis, London 2003).In Canada and Alaska _Cryptosporidium_ spp has been found in up to 23 percent of domestic animals (Olsson ME, et al: _Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_ in Canadian farm animals. Vet Parasitol 1997; 68(4): 375-81; <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9106959>) and between 0.2 and 8 percent of humans are estimated infected (Ratnam S, et al: Occurrence of _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts in fecal samples submitted for routine microbiological examination. J Clin Microbiol 1985; 22(3): 402-4; <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC268419/>. Kabani A, et al: Practice guidelines for ordering stool ova and parasite testing in a pediatric population.
