Seeing that his condition was serious, the doctor advised M.E.'s father to take the boy to a hospital in Chakwal city. In the city, ""the doctor administered a drip which he should not have as the patient's condition was very serious. After he was administered the drip, M.E's condition deteriorated,"" said District Health Officer Mohammad Aleem Danish. After this, M.E. was taken to FFH Rawalpindi where he fell unconscious and died on 30 Jul [2016].Criticizing the FFH administration, Dr Danish said M.E.'s blood samples should have been sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) on 25 Jul [2016], the day M.E. was admitted to the hospital. He said the samples were sent on 30 Jul [2016], after the boy's death. ""The virus takes 6 to 7 days to spread. If diagnosed on time, CCHF can be treated,"" he said. ""We have not yet received a written report, however, the National Institute of Health (NIH) verbally told an officer at the Director General Health Office Lahore that M.E.'s samples had tested positive [for the fever],"" Dr Danish said.M.E. is the 3rd CCFH patient to die in 2 weeks. A surgeon at the Victoria Hospital in Bahawalpur, Dr S.A.S. also died on 30 Jul [2016] at the Agha Khan Hospital in Karachi while a student nurse at District Headquarters Hospital Lodhran, died on 17 Jul [2016]. She was operated upon by Dr S.A.S. on 17 Jul [2016].Another patient from Choa Saidan Shah in Chakwal was also diagnosed with CCHF on 31 Jul [2016]. His condition is said to be stable and is being treated at the Holy Family Hospital (HFH) in Rawalpindi. An infection centre was set up at HFH where patients are first tested for dengue and CCHF, according to Dr Danish.Now that 2 CCHF cases have been reported from Chakwal, all state-run hospitals including rural health centres and basic health units have been asked to remain on high alert. ""I visited M.E.'s house in Khara and the other patient's, in Choa Saidan Shah. We set up camps in both villages and surveillance teams have also been set up,"" Dr Danish added. Director Livestock Rawalpindi Division Dr Ghulam Hussein and District Officer Livestock Dr Mohsin Raza also paid visits to the villages on Mon 1 Aug [2016]. ""We have set up 69 teams which have been tasked with visiting every home in the area and to inject and spray animals with medicines to kill off the ticks,"" Dr Ghulam Hussein told Dawn. According to the report prepared by the health department, M.S. and his family live in a mud house spread over 2.6 kanals where he has kept 6 buffaloes, 7 sheep, 5 goats and 1 dog.""CCHF spreads from animals to humans via the _Hyalomma_ tick,"" Dr Danish explained. The virus also transfers from person to person. He said farmers often take out and kill the tick as well. ""This is a very risky practice as farmers' hands have cuts and the blood from the ticks can transfer to the blood of the farmer,"" he warned. He urged the farmers not to take out ticks from the animals by hand and instead use medicines to kill them. ""Our problem is that people in the rural areas keep cattle in their homes. In many cases there is not much space between farmers' living quarters and where the animals are kept,"" he said.Since 2013, 7 people have been infected with the CCHF virus in Chakwal of which 5 recovered and 2 lost their lives.[Byline: Nabeel Anwar Dhakku]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Health, livestock depts told to take measures against Congo feverDate: Tue 2 Aug 2016Source: Dawn [edited]<http://www.dawn.com/news/1274828/health-livestock-depts-told-to-take-measures-against-congo-fever>The Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) has decided to issue advisories to provincial health departments for taking measures against the spread of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, in anticipation of the movement of animals prior to Eidul Azha.This comes after 16 cases of the fever were confirmed by the National Institute of Health (NIH), of which 5 patients have died over the last 7 months. After the cases were reported, NIH was put on high alert and the vacations of its staff were cancelled on Sat 30 Jul [2016], in order to deal with expected tests for the virus. An NIH official said that 66 samples were brought to NIH from across Punjab to be tested for CCHF of which 64 were found negative.Meanwhile, Minister NHS Saira Afzal Tarar has directed health authorities to issue advisories and share technical guidelines with the provincial health and livestock departments in order to ensure preventative measures against the spread of CCHF virus, especially since the movement of a large number of animals is expected before Eid [an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide. AO]. Ms Tarar also called for the need for a more coordinated effort for responding to a similar outbreak in the future.Secretary NHS Ayub Sheikh told Dawn that all samples from Bahawalpur and Lodhan have been found negative after a case was reported in Bahawalpur when a surgeon at the Bahawalpur Victoria Hospital, Dr S.S. died of the virus. The doctor is thought to have contracted the virus from a patient he operated on, a student nurse N.H., who also died of the illness. A total of 2 cases were also reported from Chakwal, where 1 of the patients died on Sat 30 Jul [2016].""We have been making sure of quick response for future cases and some reports of the fever have also emerged from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The patients in those provinces have recovered,"" Mr Sheikh said.Talking to Dawn, a professor of microbiology, Dr Javed Usman said an outbreak of CCHF never takes many lives. ""Usually, just a few cases are reported time and again"", he said. In reply to a question, Dr Usman said that the blood samples collected for testing are stored at 4 deg C [approx. 39 deg F] and that a polymerase chain reaction is then conducted to confirm the diagnosis. ""The first CCHF patient, referred to as index case, usually dies after which the health department becomes more careful, leading to a better recovery ratio,"" he added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Livestock vaccination against ticksDate: Tue 2 Aug 2016Source: Dawn [edited]<http://www.dawn.com/news/1274799/anti-congo-virus-steps-livestock-being-vaccinated-against-ticks-attack>The local livestock and dairy development department has launched an 'anti-tick campaign' in the division, including Cholistan desert areas, to free animals of ticks to avert Congo virus outbreak.According to divisional director Dr Shabeer Shahid, as many as 456 bike-mounted field and mobile teams of veterinary officials, equipped with medicines, have been deputed to carry out spray and administer vaccine to livestock being affected by ticks in the division. He said some 237 vet centres, 195 vet dispensaries, 65 hospitals and 23 mobile dispensaries, including 11 in Cholistan, had been reactivated for the purpose. Besides, he said the district's entry points from Rahim Yar Khan, Lodhran and Bahawalnagar sides had been blocked to check and vaccinate the cattle coming from these districts. He added the department's helpline (0800-9211) was also available for reporting any suspected case of Congo virus or tick attack among animals and get urgent help.The director said 2 probe teams, one of University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UV&AS) Lahore and the other of Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) Lahore, visited the city on [Sun 31 Jul 2016] and held a workshop of veterinary officials to educate them on anti-tick drive in the division. The teams also collected blood samples of animals for conducting their laboratory tests in Lahore to detect any Congo virus case.Meanwhile, the 2 medics -- Prof Dr Gulzar Malik and his son Dr Ahmad Ghazali -- who were quarantined in Congo ward of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH) since Wed 27 Jul [2016], have been discharged from the hospital after their blood samples were found negative for the virus.According to BVH focal person Dr Aamir Bokhari, no suspected case of Congo virus was reported at the special counter set up at the hospital or at its isolation ward during the last 2 days. He said some 1190 and 570 patients sought emergency help on [Sun 31 Jul and Mon 1 Aug 2016], respectively, at the hospital for routine treatment. He said the army probe team was expected to meet with the BVH officials on Mon 1 Aug [2016] night.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Ticks are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that transmit a wide variety of pathogens to humans and animals. The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased worldwide in both humans and domestic animals over the past years resulting in greater interest in the study of tick-host-pathogen interactions. _Hyalomma_ is a genus of hard ticks found in vast areas in Mediterranean Europe, Asia, and Africa, with a preference for arid regions. They affect cattle, sheep, goats, horses, camels, dromedaries, dogs, cats, and humans, but also a large range of wild mammals, birds and reptiles. There are about 30 _Hyalomma_ species worldwide, with species-specific distribution and prevalence.Control of _Hyalomma_ ticks as mentioned in the last report is not an easy option. The various tick control measures that are applied include;1. Non-chemical prevention and control methods----------------------------------------------- Pasture burning is a common practice in many regions of the world. For cattle tick control, the experience is that it contributes to reduce the tick numbers to some extent, but it is certainly not enough to eliminate or substantially reduce the tick populations. It cannot be used where livestock shares lands with wildlife, as in many regions where these ticks are a problem.- Livestock alternation doesn't help at all with _Hyalomma_ ticks, because they feed on whatever livestock or wildlife. Reducing the number of wild animals can have an impact on _Hyalomma_ populations, but is often impossible or simply unwelcome by the farmer.- Pasture rotation or vacation is not feasible with _Hyalomma_ ticks: they can survive very long without feeding and there will always be enough wild animals around to support tick populations.- Biological control of _Hyalomma_ and other ticks using their natural enemies remains a research topic that has not yet delivered really effective and sustainable solutions for tick population control. Tick predators such as insects (e.g. ants, wasps), small rodents or birds (e.g. cattle egrets, guinea fowls, oxpeckers, etc.) can consume significant amounts of ticks, but will not eliminate tick populations. The most promising results have been obtained so far with so called entomopathogenic fungi, i.e. fungi that are pathogenic for ticks and other insects (e.g. _Beauveria bassiana_, _Metarhizium anisopliae_, etc.). In certain countries there are commercial products for crop protection based on such fungi, and there are reports that they can effectively control ticks on cattle too. However, a systematic commercial approach to cattle tick control using such fungi is still missing. In addition, such biological control methods target tick population control and not protection of single animals or killing already attached ticks on an infected animal.For the reasons previously mentioned population control of _Hyalomma_ ticks is virtually impossible in most endemic regions.- Vaccines: There are no specific vaccines against _Hyalomma_ ticks. In recent years, studies have shown that targeting tick proteins by vaccination can not only reduce tick feeding and reproduction, but also the infection and transmission of pathogens from the tick to the vertebrate host. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705209/>. Nano/microparticle technologies can be applied toward the development of transmission-blocking vaccines that target antigens expressed only inside the vector. A few reports have shown efficacy of the Boophilus tick vaccine against certain _Hyalomma_ species. However most of the candidate products are under research and so far there are no such vaccines commercially available.- There are no repellents, chemical or natural, that effectively prevent _Hyalomma_ ticks from attaching to livestock or pets, or that cause already attached ticks to detach. So far there are no herbal remedies commercially available really effective for protecting livestock from _Hyalomma_ ticks in endemic regions.- There are no traps that effectively reduce tick populations in the pastures: whatever domestic or wild animals are much more attractive for ticks than any possible trap.2. Chemical prevention and control of _Hyalomma_ ticks with tickicides--------------------------------------------------------------------Chemical control and prevention of _Hyalomma_ ticks on livestock is based on the same parasiticides used for the control of other tick species. Most products approved for tick control belong to various chemical classes such as:- Organophosphates (e.g. chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyrifos, coumaphos, diazinon, ethion, etc.): Organochlorines were vastly used in the past, but are now prohibited for livestock in most countries.- Amidines (mainly amitraz, also cymiazole)- Synthetic pyrethroids (e.g. cypermethrin, deltamethrin, flumethrin, permethrin)- Neonicotinoids are not effective against ticks. Carbamates are often not effective enough against ticks.All these pesticides have to be used on animals. In most countries there are currently no tickicides approved for pasture treatment against cattle ticks. The major reason is that to effectively control the ticks on pasture the dose will be lethal for almost any invertebrate fauna in the pastures and for most of the vertebrates that feed on them (birds, reptiles, rodents, etc.). In addition, pastures would be also contaminated with chemicals, which could be toxic for livestock or leave illegal residues in meat and/or milk an important consideration when planning broad spraying of areas.Most pesticides are available as concentrates for topical administration as dips and sprays, or as ready-to-use pour-ons. As a thumb rule, dips are more effective than sprays and pour-ons, simply because sprays and pour-ons do not ensure a complete coverage of the whole body (e.g. ears, udders, perineum, below the tail etc.).Insecticide-impregnated ear-tags, dusts and back rubbers are not suited for the control of most _Hyalomma_ ticks <http://parasitipedia.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2548&Itemid=2827>.Just as there are clear guidelines for the case identification, diagnosis and management of CCHF in humans in the country, concrete recommendations must be formulated with input from both animal and human sectors for;- Initiating regular surveillance of ticks beginning in regions that have reported human cases.- Educating live stock and animal sector personnel on management of affected livestock.- Education of the at-risk groups such as farmers, butchers, health care workers on respective protective measures.- Lastly, as the disease is endemic, CCHF must be added to the list of notifiable diseases with a case being reported only when confirmed by laboratory testing preferably from a reference lab.- Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.]
