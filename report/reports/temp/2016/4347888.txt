Public Health England is warning people to be aware of the _E. coli_ O157 risks, which appears to be connected to eating mixed salad leaves.Figures for the South West of England specifically have not been released - but 2 people have died nationally as a result of the outbreak and there are 151 confirmed cases so far, with 144 of these in England, 6 in Wales and 1 in Scotland. Of the confirmed cases, 62 have resulted in people being hospitalized.Director of Public Health England [PHE], Dr Isabel Oliver, said medical professionals were doing all they could to deal with the _E. coli_ risk. She said: ""PHE has been working to establish the cause of the outbreak and has identified that several of the affected individuals ate mixed salad leaves including rocket leaves [arugula] prior to becoming unwell."" However, Dr Oliver said the exact cause was being investigated and other sources of infection had not been ruled out.She added: ""PHE is using various approaches including whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies to test samples from those affected. WGS technologies are at the forefront of improving the diagnosis of infectious diseases and this testing has indicated that the strain involved is likely to be an imported strain, possibly from the Mediterranean area.""PHE is also working closely with the Food Standards Agency to trace, sample and test salad products grown in the UK and other parts of Europe. All food sample results to date have been negative for _E. coli_ O157, but it's important to be aware that where food has been contaminated with _E. coli_ O157, it is not always possible to identify the bacteria on food testing. As an additional precautionary measure, we have advised a small number of wholesalers to cease adding some imported rocket leaves to their mixed salad products pending further investigations.""[Byline: Liam Trim]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Fatalities from enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections are generally related to the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and particularly in those who develop HUS and manifest central nervous system complications which include seizures and strokes. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279>.]
