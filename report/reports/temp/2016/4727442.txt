The Express Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1276248/pakistan-officially-reports-chikungunya-outbreak/>Nearly a week after the confirmation of 3 chikungunya cases, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination (NHSRC) has for the 1st time officially reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization (WHO).""It is for the 1st time that Pakistan has officially documented the cases and have reported to the WHO,"" DG Asad Hafiz said while talking to The Express Tribune on Tuesday [27 Dec 2016]. He, however, said the situation was ""under control"" and only 5 cases had been confirmed by Islamabad's National Institute of Health (NIH).Last week, 3 of the 5 cases reported in Karachi's Malir area tested positive for chikungunya, a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. The samples were taken from Malir's Saudabad Hospital.The disease surfaced after some patients suffering from high fever and joint pain were taken to the facility last month [November 2016]. Reports suggested that over 3000 people have been infected with the virus, which 1st spread in Tanzania in 1952. Later, it was identified across more than 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and America.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) advisory, the name chikungunya originates from a verb in Kimakonde meaning ""to become contorted."" This refers to the stooped appearance of those suffering from joint pain. Doctors say that apart from high fever and joint pain, nausea and vomiting are also among the symptoms of the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>Under the WHO's International Health regulations (IHR), at the national level, countries/states parties are required to assess all reports of urgent events within their territories within 48 hours by applying a specific algorithm contained in Annex II of the IHR (2005); the decision instrument <http://www.who.int/ihr/ihr_brief_no_2_en.pdf.>. This instrument provides States Parties with the parameters used to decide whether a specific event needs to be notified to WHO under the IHR (2005). When a State Party identifies an event as notifiable, it must be notified to WHO immediately, i.e., within 24 hours after having carried out the assessment of public health information related to the event. Such notification will include details of any health measure employed in response to the event as well as accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available, including case definitions, laboratory results and number of cases and deaths. The 4 decision criteria to be used by States Parties in their assessment of a public health event are:(1) the seriousness of the event's public health impact;(2) the unusual or unexpected nature of the event; (3) the risk of international disease spread; and (4) or the risk that travel or trade restrictions will be imposed by other countries.In essence, the events that must be assessed are those that may fulfill one or more of the 4 decision instrument criteria, and the events which must be notified are those that meet at least any 2 of the criteria therein.It is important that the national level assessment and reporting capacities be developed and maintained, not only to the WHO but also to provincial and local public health departments. This will ensure that the response at local and national levels is appropriate and international support can be sought as early as possible. - Mod.UBA******[2] Case UpdateDate: 28 Dec 2016Source: The Express Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1276600/chikungunya-virus-235-cases-investigated/>With the confirmation of a 4th case of chikungunya, the total number of suspected cases stands at 235, according to doctors dealing with the epidemic disease, which has partially affected District Malir.The blood sample of 21-year-old R was confirmed as positive by the National Institute of Health, Islamabad, since no facility in the biggest city of Pakistan has kits to test for chikungunya cases.Another batch of 4 samples was sent to the facility for laboratory investigations, according to the Karachi director of health, Dr Waheed Panhwar. Earlier, 3 cases were confirmed when the 1st batch of 5 samples was sent to Islamabad.Since 19 Dec 2016, 235 suspected cases of the epidemic have been recorded for further investigation, said Panhwar. However, the actual figure of patients being affected by the virus cannot be confirmed, he said, adding that the health department can neither own nor disown the figure of the people that visited different areas with complaint of fever.According to him, the health department has taken more measures than its resources allow. ""We are conducting a multi-pronged activity, such as in-door residential spraying (IRS) activity, larvicidal activity, and fumigation with the help of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation in the areas affected by the viral fever,"" he said.He further welcomed the support of people to facilitate the volunteers conducting the activities that have been initiated since 24 Dec 2016.""There is only symptomatic treatment available for chikungunya. Paracetamol is highly recommended as a treatment of the viral outbreak since it is self-limiting,"" said Dengue Prevention and Control Programme's programme manager Dr Masood Solangi, advising that the people living in the area of the chikungunya outbreak must protect themselves from the mosquito-borne disease.""They need to cover their body and increase their daily water intake and rest,"" he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/707>.]
