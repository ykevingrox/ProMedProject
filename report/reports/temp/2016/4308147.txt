Montreal Gazette [edited]<http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-issues-warning-for-lyme-disease>A steady rise in cases of Lyme disease in Quebec have experts worried as summer heralds a resurgence of ticks. The Ministry of Health and Social Services advised people who practise outdoor activities to watch out for the bugs. The disease is spread through ""deer"" and [a.k.a.] ""blacklegged"" ticks that clamp on human skin.""People have to be aware of the fact that a tick bite cannot be mundane,"" said Dr. Horacio Arruda, national director of public health. ""In certain regions of southern Quebec, particularly the Estrie, MontÌ©rÌ©gie and Centre-du-QuÌ©bec, the risk of contracting Lyme disease is real and its consequences can be important, especially if the infection isn't detected and treated in time.""There were 159 cases of Lyme disease reported last year [2015] -- a sharp rise from 32 cases in 2011.""Lyme disease has been in progression in Quebec for several years already but remains quite unknown to the population,"" said Doctor Arruda. After an outdoor activity, it is recommended to check your skin for ticks. If bitten, it is crucial to gently remove the tick with a pair of tweezers within 24 hours. Do not use your fingers because you risk crushing the tick, which would speed the spread of the disease. When removed, the tick should be placed in a sealed container for analysis in case of an infection. Then, clean your skin with soap and water and wash your hands well.People are recommended to wear light-coloured long sleeves and pants when visiting woodland areas and high vegetation environments in the months of April to November. It is also preferable to walk along paths and avoid threading through tall grass. Carrying a can of DEET or icaridin-based insect repellant can be a boon for exposed areas of the skin, save for the face.If symptoms such as a rash, fever, headache, fatigue, neck stiffness and muscle or joint pain occur within a month after getting bit, call Info-SantÌ© at 8-1-1 or see a doctor.[Byline: Shaun Michaud]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. In 2014, ProMED-mail reported on the increasing incidence of Lyme disease in the Canadian province of Quebec, mainly concentrated in MontÌ©rÌ©gie, an administrative region in the southern portion of the province south of the St. Laurence River, between the city of Montreal and the U.S. state of New York, where Lyme disease is known to be endemic. The news report above mentions MontÌ©rÌ©gie again, plus the adjacent administrative regions of Estrie and Centre-du-QuÌ©bec, where the report above says there is a risk of contracting Lyme disease. In 2013, 142 cases of Lyme disease were reported in the province (<http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/lyme-disease-cases-popping-up-in-quebec-1.1911196>) and the news report above says that there were 159 cases of Lyme disease reported last year [2015] and 32 cases in 2011.
