Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/02/news-scan-feb-04-2016>A Portuguese team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine today [1] on a likely case of human-to-human transmission of _Legionella pneumophila_, which causes Legionnaires' disease. This finding has not previously been reported.The case happened in 2014. The researchers detail the case of a 48-year-old man who worked at a cooling tower complex in Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal. Samples from the tower later tested positive for _L. pneumophila_.The man first had respiratory symptoms on Oct 14 [2014], including an intense cough. His 74-year-old mother cared for him till he was admitted to the hospital about 8 hours later. The man's condition deteriorated, and he required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on Oct 22 [2014].His mother began having symptoms on Oct 27 [2014] and was admitted to the same hospital on Nov 3 2014] with septic shock caused by pneumonia. She died on Dec 1 [2014], and her son died on Jan 7, 2015. Both later tested positive for an _L. pneumophila_ strain that matched an outbreak strain attributed to the son's workplace.The authors conclude, ""Factors that suggest person-to-person transmission are the severity of the respiratory symptoms in Patient 1, the very close contact that occurred during the 8 consecutive hours when Patient 2 took care of Patient 1, and the small area of the nonventilated room where this contact took place. In addition, the timeline of the events was highly coherent.""1. Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable Person-to-Person Transmission of Legionnaires' Disease.

Available at: <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A large community-wide outbreak of Legionnaires' disease with 334 confirmed cases occurred in October and November 2014 in Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal, which was previously reported by ProMED-mail (see also's below) (1). Vila Franca de Xira is a town 32 km (20 mi) northeast of Lisbon. The outbreak started on 14 Oct 2014, with a sharp increase in cases from 1 Nov 2014, and peaked on 6 Nov 2014. The last reported case developed symptoms on 24 Nov 2014. 90 percent of cases lived within 3 km (1.8 mi) of a wet cooling system. Epidemiological, environmental and microbiological analysis identified aerosolized release from industrial wet cooling systems as the probable source of infection. Sequence-based typing of clinical and environmental _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 isolates confirmed this link. The greatest intensity of exposure was believed to have occurred between 23 Oct and 2 Nov 2014. On 9 Nov the Environmental Inspectorate shut down and ordered the disinfection of all wet cooling systems operating in the municipality. The outbreak was considered controlled on 21 Nov 2014. One of the 1st cases of disease in the Vila Franca de Xira outbreak was a maintenance worker at the industrial cooling tower complex in Vila Franca de Xira that was subsequently found to be contaminated with _Legionella pneumophila_. His symptoms began on Oct 14, and when he returned to the home that he shared with is mother in the city of Porto, approximately 300 km (186 mi) from Vila Franca de Xira, on Oct 19, he had severe respiratory symptoms, including an intense cough. During that night, his mother took care of him until he was admitted to a hospital in Porto, approximately 8 hours later. About 1 week later, on Oct 27, his mother, who was a previously healthy 74-year-old woman, began to report fever, cough, and loss of appetite. _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 isolated from both mother and son showed the novel ST1905 profile identified as the causative strain in the Vila Franca de Xira outbreak (2). The samples had been sequenced weeks apart to avoid cross-contamination.Additional factors that suggested person-to-person transmission are the severity of the respiratory symptoms in the son, and the very close contact that occurred between mother and son in the small area of a nonventilated room. The mother was the only person infected with _L. pneumophila_ ST1905 who was not geographically linked to the Vila Franca de Xira epicenter. The son had not taken water from Vila Franca de Xira to Porto; the mother never visited Vila Franca de Xira; and no additional cases of Legionnaires' disease occurred in Porto during the Vila Franca de Xira outbreak. The 1-week interval between the son's and mother's illnesses is consistent with the incubation period of Legionnaires' disease. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (<https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/legionnaires/faq.html>), ""To date, there is no evidence in the literature that shows the spread of the disease from person-to-person contact.""  This now apparently is the 1st documented transmission of Legionnaires' disease from 1 person to another.1. Shivaji T, Sousa Pinto C, San-Bento A, et al.
