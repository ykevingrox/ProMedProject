Reviewing literature and/or ProMED mailings in reverse chronological order, we found following reports from the Mumbai region:1. Pooja R Murphy et al described recently (2016) a fatal case of IgM-confirmed acute hantavirus infection in a 30-year-old female, admitted at the Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai. She developed in her post-partum multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), needing both dialysis and ventilatory support for extreme O2 desaturation (PaO2/Fi O2 less than 100) from bilateral, rapidly progressive lung infiltrates. Tests for malaria, dengue and leptospirosis were negative [1].2. A 39-year-old man was admitted at private hospital of Ghathopar (greater Mumbai) in 2015 for increasing dyspnoea after being bitten by a rat. After 10 days of non-invasive ventilatory support, he could be discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Serologic test were positive for a hantavirus infection. The consulted Bombay Medical College (BMC) reported at least 2 other hantavirus cases in Mumbai, in 2006 and in 2010 [2].3. A 21-year-old female was admitted at Chembur Hospital, Mumbai, in 2010 for fever, severe gastro-intestinal symptoms and critical dyspnoea. A private laboratory found ""blood samples positive for hantavirus"". After 7 days in ICU and 3 days in a hospital ward, she could be discharged [3].4. Salil Mehta and Prakash Jiandani described in 2007 a total of 5 hantavirus IgM-positive cases, all admitted for MODS with acute kidney injury (AKI), dyspnoea with bilateral lung infiltrates, and hemorrhagic complications, but spontaneously remitting within a week [4].This total count, non-detailed cases included, is thus at least 10 serologically confirmed prior cases from the Mumbai region. For all these prior cases however, including the current 11th pediatric and fatal case in Mumbai, the exact infecting hantaviral pathogen was hitherto never specified, as justly remarked again by the current moderator TY.From a clinical point of view however, and with this other, clinically well-documented, fatal case in a Mumbai hospital [1], we can now readily confirm that a hantaviral agent was and is active in India, causing sometimes fatal ""hantavirus pulmonary syndrome"" (HPS), or at least acute lung injury (ALI), combined to AKI [acute kidney injury], which is mostly coined in literature as ""hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome"" (HFRS). Regrettably, details concerning the level and serotype of the IgM-positive serology were again not given. Of note, the 5 former Mumbai 2007 cases [4], had all spontaneously remitting MODS, thereby resembling the mostly milder European, Puumala virus (PUUV)-induced forms with lung involvement, described already since 1994 [5]. Indeed, rapidly developing (and sometimes fatal) non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with evanescent bilateral lung infiltrates on RX chest and pronounced O2 desaturation, should not longer be automatically classified as the ""American form of hantavirus disease"", since similar, sometimes serious, lung involvement has also been described in European, PUUV-induced forms [6] [7]. Recently, a very severe PUUV-induced ""HPS"" form in a German case needed even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), combined with dialysis, as life-saving ICU procedures, considered hitherto as mandatory only in some critical American HPS cases [8]. Perhaps now the time is ripe to accept also the existence of an Asian ""HPS"" form as well, prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, and maybe genetically related to the arvicoline PUUV agent, or the sigmodontine Sin Nombre virus (SNV) or Andes virus (ANDV) forms? However, the 5 Mumbai cases [4] presented also overt hemorrhagic manifestations, including hematuria, hematemesis, melena or bleeding gums, symptoms which are rare in South-American ANDV cases, exceptional in PUUV cases, and almost non-existent in North-American SNV infections. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of serious hemorrhages with ""HPS"" is a rare clinical combination in all hantavirus infections, except perhaps for some rare Dobrava virus (DOBV) infections, which are absent in India.Apart from unanswered clinical questions, the main enigma remains of course the viral origin, more than 10 years after the 1st report of fatal Indian hantavirus cases, presenting with ""HPS"" and ""HFRS"" [9]. Surprisingly, both these fatal cases, one from Cochin and another from Chennai, yielded IgM and IgG positive results in ELISA and in more specific strip immunoassay (SIA) [9]. Negative results were obtained however with primers specific for most of the then known hantaviral pathogens, being PUUV, Seoul virus (SEOV), DOBV, ANDV, and the Korean prototype Hantaan virus (HTNV). Moreover, we also performed RT-PCR for Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), a shrew-borne hantavirus autochthonous to India, which was equally negative [10]. In their 2007 publication [4], the Indian authors found increasing IgM OD values in repeated screening with a commercial ELISA IgM kit (Focus Technologies, Cypress, CA, USA), containing 5 different hantaviral antigens, being HTNV, SEOV, PUUV, DOBV, and SNV. Regrettably, the highest obtained OD values were not mentioned, but it should be noted that for these 5 hantaviral pathogens, the only rodent carrier with an established presence in India, is the wild rat (_Rattus rattus_), spreading SEOV. However, another murine pathogen, Thailand virus (THAIV), can give extensive serological cross-reactions with SEOV, and the THAIV rodent carrier, the bandicoot rat (_Bandicota indica_), is likewise present throughout most of the Indian subcontinent. In a retrospective study on 9 serum samples of non-acute patients, selected as being ELISA IgG-positive with the same commercial Focus Technologies kit, S Chandy et al found 2 sera subsequently clearly reacting with THAIV truncated nucleocapsid proteins (NP), but none with PUUV NP [11]. Finally, and in 2009, S Chandy et al reported, a typical HFRS case without lung involvement in Cudappah, Andhra Pradesh, confirmed as being hantavirus-induced by positive ELISA IgM and IgG with the same commercial Focus Technologies kit, and confirmed by IFA with HTNV. RT-PCR however was again negative [12]. The prototype Korean HTNV, in hantavirus pioneer times long time used as sole screening antigen, is known for its beneficial potential to pick up non-homologous infecting hantaviral serotypes, but a true HTNV infection is to be excluded here, since the rodent HTNV carrier, the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_), is absent from India. However, an acute infection by other murine pathogens such as SEOV or THAIV is distinctly possible.As for the current fatal 12-year-old hantavirus case, we agree with the moderator that further results, expected from the consulted National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, would be of utmost interest, since once again the exact or putative hantaviral pathogen was not specified in the ""positive results"", apparently delivered by a private laboratory. We also agree with the moderator that confusion subsists as to the question if (concomitant?) leptospirosis played a role in the fatal outcome. Profuse bleeding from the lungs is suggestive for leptospirosis, rather than for hantaviral acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, characterized by bilateral, but evanescent lung infiltrates on RX chest. Moreover, both ELISA and MAT testing for leptospirosis can remain false-negative during the 1st days after infection. Thus, dual concomitant leptospirosis-hantavirus infection is a (often underestimated) possibility, as shown in Sri Lanka [13], a country highly endemic for leptospirosis, and even in Belgium [14], where the leptospirosis prevalence is very low.In summary, there is now since more than 10 years mounting clinical and serological evidence of ""HPS"" and/or ""HFRS"" prevalent in India, but still without any conclusive biomolecular proof so far of the exact etiologic hantaviral agent(s). SEOV, THAIV, and possibly a PUUV-like novel agent are possible contenders. The authors of this ProMED mail contacted several times, and since years, all cited Indian and Sri Lankan authors for obtaining more fresh serum samples of suspected clinical cases from their respective centers, however without success so far. Without clear knowledge concerning the involved hantavirus virus species and their rodent (or insectivore?) carriers, prevalent in India, preventive measures will remain futile, and consequently, further morbidity and even fatality rates from this emerging infection will probably remain unaltered in this subcontinent.References----------1.
