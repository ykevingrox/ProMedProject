Others say the lacks of regular awareness about some preventable diseases is a major cause of the snail fever and other diseases in the area.County Surveillance Officer (CSO) of Gbarpolu, Augustus Alfred said, ""We are currently doing health education campaign about the risks of getting infected by bathing and fishing in fresh running water as well as stagnant water.""[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Central Liberia was found highly endemic for both _Schistosoma mansoni_ and _S. haematobium_ more than 30 years ago (1), which was linked to swamp rice farming (2). _Schistosoma_ infections are more recently reported in refugees from Liberia (3). There is no reason to believe that Schistosomaisis in Liberia is less frequent now than it was in the 1980s.References----------1.- Saladin B, Saladin K, Holzer B, Dennis E, Hanson A and DegrÌ©mont A.
