TASS Russian News Agency [edited]<http://tass.ru/en/world/887888>The notorious bubonic plague, one of the world's most dangerous infectious diseases, which killed 1/3 of Europe's population in the Middle Ages has infected a Siberian youngster. A 10-year old boy in Siberia's Altai Republic has contracted bubonic plague, local medics told TASS on Wed [13 Jul 2016].""The boy was hospitalized yesterday [12 Jul 2016] with a high fever and tested positive for bubonic plague. He is in a serious condition,"" doctors said. All the 17 people, including 6 children, with whom the boy had contact, have been quarantined. The boy is believed to have picked up the disease during a hiking trip to the mountains, where groundhogs [see below - Mod.LL] have been found to be plague carriers, medics explained.According to the WHO, more than 13 000 people contracted bubonic plague in Asia, Africa, and America between 2004 and 2013. Roughly 900 of them died from the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The reservoir of plague in the this area of the world is primarily the marmot (probably Siberian marmot _Marmota sibirica_. They are hunted for their fur, and hunters get bitten by their infected fleas, or infected from their blood when skinning them. For a photo, see <http://tinyurl.com/gqjmvcl>. Humans are infected from the animal reservoir by being fed upon by the mammal's infested fleas or from direct contact with an infected animal.In North America, groundhog (or woodchuck), _Marmota monax_ is found through most of the eastern and central USA and then its range extends into northwest Canada (see range at <http://naturalhistory.si.edu/mna/thumbnails/maps/Marm_mona.gif>). Unlike the Siberian marmot, the North American woodchuck appears to be rarely if ever associated with plague or its transmission to humans probably because the range does not overlap much with the endemic areas for _Yersinia pestis_ in North America.Plague only transmits from person-to-person by the respiratory route, which occurs from bacteremia spread of the organism to the lung from the bubo (secondary pneumonic plague) or when the organism is acquired from inhalation (primary pneumonic plague).Maps of Russia can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/474>. Altai Republic is located in southern Siberia. - Mod.LL]
