Nevertheless, it is important to note the inherent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation capacities. It remains possible that detection of a case could be delayed in some remote areas. A strong and sustained surveillance effort is therefore more crucial than ever.Epidemiological situationAngolaAll of the 4 laboratory positive cases reported in the 16 Sep [2016] situation report that were under investigation had a history of yellow fever vaccination and so were ruled out as being new yellow fever cases.From 5 Dec 2015 - 22 Sep 2016:- 4143 suspected cases, with 373 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 9.0 percent);- 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7 percent).Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces. Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces.Luanda and Huambo provinces have reported the highest number of total cases. As of 22 Sep [2016], 2092 (50 percent of all reported cases) cases including 488 confirmed cases have been reported in Luanda and 646 (16 percent of all reported cases) cases including 128 confirmed cases have been reported in Huambo.Democratic Republic of The Congo (DRC)From 1 Jan - 27 Sep 2016:- 2810 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces;- 76 confirmed cases have been identified from 2345 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21 percent);- Of the 76 confirmed cases, reported from 8 provinces, 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous, and 6 are cases of sylvatic transmission (not related to the outbreak).5 of the 8 cases in Kinshasa province that were under investigation had a history of yellow fever vaccination and have been ruled out as new yellow fever cases. 7 cases remain under investigation including the 1st notified case reported in Sud Ubangi province in Bominenge Health Zone (1st reported in the week to 25 Aug [2016]). The 6 other cases under investigation were reported in the provinces of Tshuapa (one case), Bas Uele (one case), and Kinshasa (4 cases).The 13 autochthonous cases related to the current outbreak were reported from 10 Health Zones in 3 provinces: Kinshasa (6 cases), Kongo Central (2 cases) and Kwango (5 cases). The most affected age group among men is 25 to 29 years of age (0.53 per 100 000) and 35 to 39 years of age among women (0.16 per 100 000)ResponseInformation on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website.In DRC, the 10 day reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi and Mushenge Health Zones in Kwango province will begin next week. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted last month [August 2016]. Recent political unrest may pose operational challenges. WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to DRC and Angola through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile and with additional vaccines from Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.As of 27 Sep 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for DRC.The number of vaccines currently available for the emergency response is 8.8 million through the ICG. The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the outbreak in Angola and the DRC appear to be ending, the 10 day reactive vaccination campaign in the DRC will help to ensure that there are no flare-ups of transmission. Sylvatic cases continue to pop up in the DRC and will need to be detected early, with timely responses. Although no cases have been reported there, the Republic of the Congo's plans for a pre-emptive vaccination campaign is prudent, to avoid the risk of spillover from the DRC. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo and R Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>]
