MesVaccins.net [in French, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<https://www.mesvaccins.net/web/news/10092-augmentation-des-cas-de-legionellose-au-retour-de-dubai> An increase in cases of legionellosis, is reported among European Union travelers returning from Dubai. 26 symptomatic cases since 1 Oct 2016 have been reported. The majority of reported cases have been associated with different hotels distributed geographically throughout Dubai. This suggests that the cases have been exposed to a common source in the wider environment and not associated with the hosting sites.Data collection is underway in relevant European Union countries to collect information on new cases, with an emphasis on possible exhibition locations in Dubai, and on the way to and from Dubai.It is important to quickly communicate information about potential infection sites to local health authorities in Dubai in order to support the ongoing investigation to identify the sources of infection.Legionnaires' disease is a disease of varying severity ranging from mild febrile to fatal forms of pneumonia. It is due to exposure to _Legionella_ species. After an incubation period of 2 to 10 days, legionellosis is manifested by acute pulmonary infections. The 1st symptoms resemble an [influenza-like illness] (fever, dry cough), followed by an increase in fever which can reach 39.5 degrees C [103.1 degrees F]. The patient experiences feelings of discomfort, as well as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, accompanied by mental disturbances (confusion, disorientation, hallucinations leading to delirium and coma).The disease can develop with 2 types of complications: respiratory failure and acute renal failure, which are often fatal. _Legionella_, however, [infect] mainly the most fragile individuals, such as immunocompromised persons or fragile persons (those who have been recently operated upon, the elderly, infants). [Legionnaires' disease in infants is rare.]Around the world, waterborne _Legionella pneumophila_ is the most common cause of infection and outbreaks. This species and related species are commonly found in lakes, rivers, torrents, hot springs and other water collections. Other species, such as _Legionella longbeachae_, can be found in potting compost. The bacterium lives and multiplies in water systems at temperatures between 20 and 50 degrees C [68-122 degrees F] (optimal temperature of 35 degrees C [95 degrees F]).The most common route of _Legionella_ transmission is through the inhalation of contaminated aerosols. The aerosol sources associated with this transmission are the cooling towers of air conditioning systems, hot and cold water systems, air humidifiers and hot tubs.Source: European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.

Increase of cases of Legionnaires' disease in EU travellers returning from Dubai, October-December 2016. 22 Dec 2016.

Further cases with onset in recent weeks are being reported following travel to Dubai, indicating that there is a persistent common source of _Legionella_ exposure. However, it cannot be ruled out that these travellers might have acquired their infection elsewhere than in Dubai, if their travel stay was shorter than the range of the incubation period.""The increase in cases cannot be fully explained by the increase in the number of travellers to Dubai from the EU.""The following options are possible in response to this outbreak:- Conduct additional retrospective investigations for travel-associated Legionnaires' disease (TALD) cases reported by EU countries. Investigations should cover cases with onset of symptoms since 1 Oct 2016 and focus on possible places of exposure in Dubai, and on the way to and from Dubai. A questionnaire has been developed, and data collection is ongoing in affected EU countries.- Use the above questionnaire to collate information on new TALD cases reported by EU/EEA countries, with a focus on possible places of exposure in Dubai, and on the way to and from Dubai.- Quickly provide information collected about possible exposure sites in Dubai for TALD cases to local health authorities in order to guide the identification of possible sources of _Legionella_ bacteria in the environment in Dubai.- Support the continued investigations of the local Dubai health authorities on accommodation sites reported through ELDSNet [6] surveillance network by notifying new TALD cases in order to rule out risks associated with specific accommodation sites.- Inform travellers -- particularly those above 50 years of age, smokers and immunocompromised persons -- to seek medical advice if they experience respiratory infection symptoms up to 2 weeks after travelling to Dubai to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.- Remind clinicians to consider Legionnaires' disease in patients presenting with community-acquired atypical pneumonia with a history of travel to Dubai or the United Arab Emirates in the 2 weeks prior to disease onset.""It is important to implement precautionary control measures for technical installations (e.g. man-made water systems) at all accommodation sites that were frequented by cases during the disease incubation period. In addition, it would be desirable that these risk-minimising measures are extended to also cover other potential sources of exposure in Dubai, for example misting devices, fountains, and other devices that create aerosols.""Any information from the Dubai authorities' retrospective review of possible cases of Legionnaires' disease among the Dubai population will be important in gaining a better understanding of the increase observed in travellers.""As Legionnaires' disease cannot be transmitted from human to human, the risk for the EU remains limited to individual cases among travellers in the above risk groups returning from Dubai.""Dubai is one of the 7 emirates and the most populous city of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai>). Dubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum dynasty since 1833.Dubai can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3442>. - Mod.ML]
