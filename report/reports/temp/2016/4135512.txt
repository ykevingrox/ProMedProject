That group would include children with compromised immunity, pregnant women, and premature infants.--Communicated by:ProMED mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Varicella-zoster virus causes chicken pox, the most common fatal childhood disease in the USA (<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/varicella-usa.jpg>). The disease ranks 4th among all vaccine-preventable deaths, but the vaccine is reputedly 70-90 percent effective (<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/vaccines-usa.jpg>). Vaccinated individuals who come down with the disease are generally protected from the most severe symptoms.The recommendation is that once the 1st dose has been administered, the child should receive a 2nd dose in 28 days, if age 13 or older. For those under 13, the 2nd dose should be administered at 3 months.

With no school in session Tuesday [29 Mar 2016], he said he immediately called in cleaning crews to vigorously disinfect the high school.When students came back to school on Wednesday [30 Mar 2016], he sent a letter home with them, telling parents about the confirmed case of MRSA. In the letter, the superintendent said the case may have originated from the high school, and the areas susceptible were the locker rooms and weight rooms.""That's great that the school was proactive. I love this district, and they communicate well. I have heard nothing bad about this district,"" a mother said.The school district also recently sent home a letter to parents after learning a student had a case of chicken pox. Officials said the student had been quarantined and will not be at school until a doctor confirms he or she is not contagious.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) infection is caused by a type of staphylococcus bacterium that's become resistant to many of the antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections. According to the CDC, it is generally not necessary to close entire schools to ""disinfect"" them when MRSA infections occur. MRSA skin infections are transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact and by contact with surfaces that have come into contact with someone else's infection. Covering cuts and abrasions will greatly reduce the risks of surfaces becoming contaminated with MRSA, especially during contact sports.A map of Michigan, United States, can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.
