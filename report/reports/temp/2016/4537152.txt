Since that time, there have been reports of infections by _C. auris_ in several countries around the world, most notably in South Korea, South Africa, Kuwait, and India. The majority of those cases were associated with health care services. In 2012, the 1st hospital outbreak of _C. auris_ detected in the Region of the Americas was reported in Venezuela. The outbreak occurred in the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital.The incidence rate and prevalence of this pathogen is not well known because detection methods to diagnose _C. auris_ routinely identify it as part of the _Candida haemulonii_ complex, which is phylogenetically related, or identify it as other frequent yeast isolations (2,11). For this reason, _C. auris_ may be a more common cause of candidemia than originally considered (3).Reported cases of _C. auris_ have occurred in patients with prolonged stay in hospitals, particularly in neonatal and adult intensive care units; most of them received broad spectrum antibiotics, had intravenous catheters, and were on mechanical ventilation. Most of the isolates were in blood, although there are also reports of _C. auris_ in other biological samples, such as urine and in bronchoalveolar fluid. To date, it has not been established whether the presence at these locations represents evidence of infection or colonization; the transmission mechanism is unknown.Due to difficulties of identifying _C. auris_ through commercial methods, its characterization is performed by sequencing. An additional reliable method for the identification of this pathogen is obtaining the proteic profile by MALDI TOF [matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry] (4,8,9,10,11)Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------The 1st detected outbreak of _C. auris_ in the Region of the Americas was reported in Venezuela. The outbreak occurred from March 2012 to July 2013, in the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital in Maracaibo. The outbreak affected 18 patients, 13 of which were pediatric. 2 The case fatality rate was 28 percent. Of note, all isolates were initially identified as _C. haemulonii_. Later sequencing of ITS and analysis by AFLP [amplified fragment length polymorphism] conducted to study the possible clonality of the isolates involved in the outbreak, identified that it was _C. auris_.Regarding the sensitivity of strains, all isolates were resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole, and half of the isolates showed elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to amphotericin B.In Colombia isolated cases of infection by _C. auris_ have been reported in various cities (City of Santa Marta, Bogota, and Valledupar) since 2013. Between 2015 and 2016, the city of Barranquilla reported 27 isolates. In August 2016, an outbreak was reported in a pediatric intensive care unit in the district of Cartagena. 5 cases of disseminated infection of _C. auris_ were identified. Initially the 5 isolates were identified as _C. albicans_, _C. guillermondii_, and _Rhodotorula rubra_, but after performing MALDI-TOF they were confirmed as _C. auris_.The use of a central venous catheter, mechanical ventilation, or urinary catheter, was a risk factor for all confirmed cases. As to the antifungal susceptibility test, only the results of two out of the 5 isolates are available, both of which were sensitive to fluconazole and resistant to amphotericin B (5).In the United States of America, _C. auris_ isolation was reported as part of a surveillance program in 2013 (6).Given these findings, PAHO/WHO makes the following recommendations (7):Surveillance and epidemiological investigation----------------------------------------------- Increase the participation of national laboratories in hospital-based surveillance in order to facilitate the timely detection of this organism.- Disseminate information obtained from surveillance for the implementation of adequate treatment and infection control measures in health care service.- Sampling all patients coming from hospitals where cases of _C. auris_ colonization/infection have been reported is recommended.- Urge health care professionals to contact the relevant public health authorities, either local or national, if they suspect that a patient may have a _C. auris_ infection in a health care service center.Laboratory diagnosis--------------------- All laboratories with _C. auris_ detection methods (MALDI-TOF or molecular methods) are recommended to notify any positive isolation for this organism.- Faced with the isolation of any of the following listed microorganisms, whether by conventional or commercial methods, it is recommended to contact the relevant public health authorities to assess the need for specific tests for the detection of _C. auris_: _C. haemulonii_, regardless of the type of sample; other _Candida_ species, such as, _C. guilliermondii_, _C. famata_, or _C. sake_; other yeasts, such as, _Rhodotorula glutinis_ and _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_; identification of _C. albicans_ without germ tube production and with high MIC to azoles and/or amphotericin.- In the event of the isolation of any of the _Candida_ species mentioned above, sensitivity tests, mainly of azoles and amphotericin B, must be performed by commercial methods and must be confirmed by the microdilution reference method (*,12)Infection prevention and control--------------------------------Upon detection of _C. auris_ isolates in a patient, it is recommended to:- Keep the patient in isolation, if possible, and use gloves and gowns for any patient contact. The use of masks and face shield is only indicated when there is a risk of body fluid exposure.- Keep the environment clean. Clean with soap and water followed by disinfection with 0.1 percent bleach. Once the patient is discharged, cleanliness of the surfaces, floor, and wall must be ensured with soap and water, followed by 0.1 percent disinfection bleach.- Clean, disinfect, or sterilize equipment and appliances as per the type of material, after use by the patient.- Isolate patients coming from centers with documented presence of _C. auris_ until screening results have been obtained.- Obtain a series of 3 negative samples, preferably urine, blood, or respiratory secretions, to remove the patient from isolation; each sample should be at least 24 hours apart.- When a patient requires a test or services that cannot be carried out in the patient's room, that test or service should be scheduled at the end of the day and thorough cleaning of the area after realizing the test should take place.- Apply special care in handling waste, following the same recommendations for multi-resistant pathogens. In the case of pediatric units, special attention should be placed on the elimination of diapers of colonized/infected patients. The handling of dirty laundry in a patient's room should be done carefully to minimize the environmental spread of the microorganism.- Avoid hand-washing the patient's linens and clothes; washing by machine is recommended.* Currently, there are no MIC specific values for _C. auris_; therefore, other _Candida_ spp cutoff are being used as a reference in accordance with the M27-S4 document of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (13).- Waste from these patients should not be disposed of in a sink.Treatment---------- Currently, the 1st-line of treatment are the echinocandins, which are used while the sensitivity test results are pending. There is evidence suggesting the rapid development of resistance to this family of antifungals.- Currently, there is insufficient evidence on the appropriate treatment. Using combined antifungal therapy at the initial stage is not recommended; however, clinicians must make the decision on an individual basis.References----------1.
