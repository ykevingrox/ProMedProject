WHO, Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface (HAI) [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_11_15_2016.pdf>Summary and assessment [4 Oct to 21 Nov 2016]---------------------------------------------- New infections: since the previous update, new human infections with influenza A(H5N6), A(H7N9), [see accompanying post Avian influenza, human (67): WHO, H5N6, H7N9, risk assessment, archive number: to be determined] and A(H1N1)v viruses were reported.- Risk assessment: the overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed. Further human infections with viruses of animal origin can be expected, but the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission remains low.- IHR compliance: all human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are reportable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).This includes any animal and non-circulating seasonal viruses. Information from these notifications will continue to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface.Swine influenza viruses-----------------------Influenza A(H1N1)v viruses--------------------------Current situationThe Netherlands detected a human case of infection with an influenza A(H1N1)v virus in a child with onset of illness on [26 Oct 2016]. The patient was admitted to a hospital with severe respiratory symptoms and received supportive treatment and oseltamivir. The patient has since recovered and been discharged from hospital. Close contacts of the patient were closely monitored for 10 days and no further cases were detected. The patient had visited a pig farm a few days prior to illness onset. A highly similar virus was detected upon sampling of the pigs from the farm. The influenza A virus detected from the patient was unsubtypeable with the routine human seasonal influenza diagnostics and therefore the haemagglutinin (HA) gene was sequenced.All genes recovered from the virus detected in this case were similar to Eurasian lineage avian-like swine influenza A(H1N1) viruses circulating in pigs in the Netherlands in the past decennia. Other sporadic human cases of infection with swine influenza virus have been detected in Europe in the past, including in the Netherlands.Risk assessment1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with influenza A(H1N1)v viruses will occur?Influenza A(H1N1) viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases are exposed to the swine A(H1N1) virus through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and one fatal case has been reported. Since these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations, further human cases can be expected.2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H1N1)v viruses?No case clusters have been reported. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.3. What is the risk of international spread of influenza A(H1N1)v viruses by travellers?Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.Overall risk management recommendations- WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to OIE guidance.- WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.- Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high.- All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.- It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories and reported according to international standards. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above also includes useful links to additional information:- WHO Human-Animal Interface web page<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/en/>- Cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/>- Avian influenza A(H7N9) information<http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html>- WHO avian influenza food safety issues<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/zoonose/avian/en/>- World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) web page; web portal on avian influenza<http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/>- Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) webpage; Avian Influenza<http://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/index.html>- OFFLU [OIE/FAO global network of expertise on animal influenza]<http://www.offlu.net/index.html>Influenza viruses circulating in animals pose threats to human health. Humans can become ill when infected with viruses from animal sources, such as avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1, H7N9, H5N8, and H9N2 and swine influenza virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. The primary risk factor for human infection appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead animals or contaminated environments (<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/about/en/>). This situation reinforces the need for close monitoring/surveillance in animals and humans for emergence of novel strains and close collaboration between public health and veterinary authorities. - Mod.UBA]
