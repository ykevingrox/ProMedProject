On 29 Oct 2016, there was another primary case with exposure histories under investigation reported from Buraidah as well. On 18 Oct 2016 there was a primary case with a history of direct camel contact reported from Buraidah as well. A question that comes to mind is whether there was any connection between the possible index case reported on 18 Oct 2016 and the 3 other ""primary"" cases reported on 29 Oct 2016 and 3 Nov 2016 ... perhaps they sought medical assistance outside of the hospital environment with a healthcare worker who also attended the MERS-CoV case reported on 18 Oct 2016, or was in the vicinity of the camel farm where the earliest case had been.Maps showing the locations of the 2 newly reported cases and 2 newly reported recoveries can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPP]******[2] WHO update - 31 Oct 2016Date: 31 Oct 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/31-october-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia-----------------------------------------------------------------------Between 16 Sep 2016 and 10 Oct 2016 the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia seven (7) additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) including one (1) fatal case.Details of the cases1.
