Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1052784/balochistans-first-polio-case-of-year-confirmed/>A fresh case of polio disease emerged in Balochistan as a 2-year-old boy was diagnosed with the crippling disease on Tuesday [23 Feb 2016].The virus surfaced in Quetta's Samungli area, with an official confirming that it was the 1st case of the year 2016.According to the Coordinator of the Emergency Operation Centre, Dr Syed Saifur Rehman, environmental samples of the virus from Qilla Abdullah were found to be positive.The 1st polio case of the year [2016] has surfaced in Karachi. The provincial government is conducting immunisation campaigns in the province every 2 months to eradicate the virus, Rehman said, while urging parents to cooperate with the vaccinators.The total number of polio cases in Pakistan this year [2016] has now reached 3, while 7 cases were reported from Balochistan in 2015.Earlier, at the advent of vaccination on [15 Feb 2016], Chief Minister Sanaullah Zehri appealed to local body representatives, political and tribal leaders, as well as religious scholars to make immunisation a success. A 3-year-old boy crippled by polio was given drops at least 9 times.The campaign focused on Pishin, Quetta, Qilla Saifullah, Loralai, Khuzdar, Qilla Abdullah, Sherani, Lasbella, Barkhan, Zhob, Nasirabad, Jaffarabad, Musa Khel, Jhal Magsi and Dera Bugti districts.[Byline: Mohammad Zafar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The HealthMap/ProMED map of Pakistan can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Laos, cVDPV - WHO updateDate: 25 Feb 2016Source: WHO Global Alert and Response, Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/25-february-2016-polio-lao/en/>Between [6 and 16 Feb 2016], the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) of Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) notified WHO of 3 additional cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1).Details of the new cases:- The 1st case is a 15-month-old female from Phonhoung district, Vientiane Province. The patient developed paralysis on [8 Jan 2016].- The 2nd case is a 44-year-old female from Feuang district, Vientiane Province. The patient developed paralysis on [11 Jan 2016].Neither of the 2 cases received oral polio vaccine (OPV). On [3 Feb 2016], the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan reported that stool samples for both cases tested positive for type 1 circulating vaccine-derived polio virus (cVDPV1). There is no epidemiological link between the 2 cases.The 3rd case is an 18-year-old male from Meun district, Vientiane Province. The case developed paralysis on [3 Jan 2016]. Test results for his stool specimen are pending; however, the specimen was considered to be ""inadequate"" since it was collected more than 14 days after the onset of paralysis. A stool sample collected from a close contact tested positive for VDPV1; the case is classified as cVDPV1 based on the epidemiological link and the contact's positive stool sample.Of note is that these new cVDPV1 isolates are genetically linked but have considerable genetic differences with the previous Laos cVDPV1 isolates from the current outbreak. The new findings suggest that more than one strain of cVDPV1 may have emerged separately and co-circulated in Laos without being detected.To date, the total number of confirmed cVDPV1 cases in this outbreak is 10. Furthermore, since the beginning of the outbreak, circulating cVDPV1 has been isolated from the stools of 23 healthy contacts in the provinces of Bolikhamxay, Xaisomboun and Vientiane.After the reports of a number of cVDPV1 positive cases in previously healthy contacts, enhanced surveillance is maintained nationally, especially in the newly affected districts. The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is also communicating information on the event and response activities with the neighboring countries.Since the detection of the 1st confirmed cVDPV1 in Lao PDR in October 2015, outbreak response activities have been conducted nationwide, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) between December 2015 and January 2016. A polio outbreak response plan was drafted, and emergency operations centers have been activated at the national and provincial levels to coordinate response efforts. Enhanced surveillance is being carried out throughout the country, including daily zero-reporting of AFP cases. Active case finding is ongoing in high-risk districts, including a retrospective review of hospital and health centre records.The outbreak response, including a series of SIAs, is being conducted as planned, targeting all children aged under 15 years as well as people of all ages in districts where high-risk groups are present.The reported cases of cVDPV1 indicate that the level of population immunity in the affected areas is low, and there is a risk of further spread of this strain. It is likely that the cVDPV1 strain has been circulating for several months in these areas. Based on experiences from previous similar events, it is expected that additional cases will be reported. However, if the supplementary immunization activities cover the target population effectively, the risk of international spread from Lao PDR is expected to be low. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.The temporary recommendations issued in November 2015 by the WHO Director-General following the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005) to limit the international spread of poliovirus from countries affected by cVDPVs remain in effect. In line with these recommendations, any country infected by cVDPV should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

The videos are available in both English and French.- There are 8 weeks to go until the globally synchronized switch from the trivalent to bivalent oral polio vaccine, an important milestone in achieving a polio-free world. Read more about the reasons behind the switch here. Read more ongoing preparation for the switch here.Afghanistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week. The most recent case reported onset of paralysis in Shahwalikot, Kandahar, on [20 Dec 2015].- No new WPV1 environmental positive samples were reported in the past week. The most recent environmental positive samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015], one in Jalalabad in Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned from [15 to 18 Mar 2016], prior to the switch.Pakistan- One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the last week, in Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with onset of paralysis on [22 Jan 2016]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is now 2, compared to 9 reported for 2015 at this point last year [2015].- One new WPV1 environmental positive was reported in the past week in Karachi Gadap, Sindh province, with collection on [27 Jan 2016].- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in March [2016] using tOPV.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent was reported in Fueng, Vientiane, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in 2016 remains 2.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.- An emergency outbreak response is continuing in the country, with particular focus on 3 high-risk provinces.- Efforts continue to further strengthen surveillance activities in all provinces of the country to assure that no cVPDV1 transmission is missed anywhere.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are underway from [15 to 28 Feb 2016], and Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) are planned for March 2016 using tOPV. Both campaigns are targeting an expanded age group of children up to the age of 15 years.Madagascar- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015] from Sud-Ouest region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 remains 10. - The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset of paralysis in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus. - The focus of the outbreak response is on strengthening subnational surveillance, and filling vaccination coverage gaps. - The emergency outbreak response continues to be intensified. National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned from [14 to 18 Mar 2016] and [11 to 15 Apr 2016] using tOPV.Myanmar- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have been reported in Myanmar. The most recent reported case was isolated from a 16-month old child in Maungdaw, Rakhine, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 remains 2.- The case is genetically linked to a VDPV isolated in the same township in April [2015], which has now been reclassified as a cVDPV type 2. The genetic changes in the isolate suggest the cVDPV2 has been circulating for more than a year.- The Ministry of Health of Myanmar is being supported by WHO and partners of the GPEI in planning and implementing an urgent response to the newly detected outbreaks.- Significant immunization gaps remain in Myanmar, with an estimated 24 percent of children un- or under-immunized. Vaccination coverage remains particularly low among special at-risk populations. AFP surveillance quality indicators are acceptable at the national level, but subnational gaps persist.- While WHO assesses the risk of international spread from Myanmar to be low, surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.Nigeria- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. No cases were reported in 2015. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014] in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano state.- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis in Kwali Local Government Area (LGA), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, with onset of paralysis on [16 May 2015]; this is the only cVDPV2 case reported in Nigeria in 2015.- Vigilance must be maintained to ensure that all children are reached with polio vaccines and that surveillance systems remain alert to polioviruses.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned from [27 Feb 2016 to 1 Mar 2016], and from [19 to 22 Mar 2016], both using trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV).Ukraine- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2015] in the Zakarpatskaya oblast, in south-western Ukraine, bordering Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The number of cVDPV1 cases reported in 2015 remains 2.- An assessment of the outbreak response in Ukraine, while acknowledging the efforts of Ministry of Health staff and partners, has concluded that major and rapid improvements are required in campaign quality and surveillance to ensure the outbreak is closed within 6 months.- Ukraine had been at particular risk of emergence of a cVDPV, due to very low vaccination coverage.- Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) using tOPV will be carried out in March [2016]. West Africa- Three new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported from Guinea in the past week, all in Kankan province. The 1st 2 cases were reported from Siguiri district and the 3rd from Kankan district, with onset of paralysis on [10 Oct 2015, 1 Dec 2015 and 14 Dec 2015], respectively. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is now 7. The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset in August 2014.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Niger and Sierra Leone from [26 to 29 Feb 2016] and in Guinea from [3 to 6 Mar 2016]. These will be repeated from [25 to 28 Mar 2016]. The March [2016] round of NIDs will also include Mauritania. All campaigns are using trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As one can see from the above reports, the media tends to report on polio cases in advance of the official reports, but oftentimes without the official laboratory confirmations so that the type of virus involved (wild poliovirus -- WPV -- vs. circulating vaccine derived poliovirus, cVDPV) is not yet known. Hence, while the official data as of 24 Feb 2016 has a total of 2 cases of polio in Pakistan since 1 Jan 2016 (section 3 above), the media is reporting on a 3rd case (see [1] above).In addition, while the official weekly summary from the polio eradication website mentions 2 cases of cVDPV1 in Laos since 1 Jan 2016 (see section 3 above), there is a WHO DON report dated one day later that mentions 3 cases of cVDVP1 in Laos since 1 Jan 2016.It does appear as though suboptimal coverages are still present in countries that had interrupted WPV transmission, as seen by the ongoing circulation of the cVDPVs in Laos and Guinea. And cases continue to be confirmed in Pakistan.For a map showing the locations of WPV- and cVDPV-associated polio cases, see <http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx>. - Mod.MPP]
