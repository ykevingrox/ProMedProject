""We have sent a team of experts to Bukakata to verify whether the cause of [the] deaths is related to yellow fever,"" he said.Dr Musisi said some sources in Bukakata had informed the health authorities that the deceased persons had also died on [Wed 13 Apr 2016] with symptoms related to the disease outbreak. He said laboratory tests confirmed yellow fever as the cause of the death of the 6 people who died earlier in Buwunga sub-county.

An official from the Ministry of Health, Ahimbisibwe strongly advised the people in Masaka to sleep under mosquito nets. He said the mosquito which spreads yellow fever comes from the forest jungles and spreads it from animals to humans or humans to humans. Ahimbisibwe also said the Ministry of Health is organizing a mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever in Masaka region.[Byline: Dismus Buregyeya]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report adds some confusion about the etiology of the diseases that have occurred. The District Health officer indicated that the earlier 6 cases were laboratory confirmed as YF infections, and then stated that they ""suffered multiple infections connected to typhoid and yellow fever."" ProMED would appreciate additional information clarifying the etiologies of these cases, as well any results of laboratory tests of the 3 new cases. If these 3 new cases are, indeed, YF, then virus transmission is continuing in the area. The vaccination effort in the area of risk should move forward and is urgent. A prompt response to the outbreak is essential to prevent its spread, especially at the current time, when stocks of YF vaccine are very limited.No mention is made of whether any vector control measures are being carried out there. If this is a forest (sylvan) cycle of transmission, it is important to reduce the risk of spill-over into an urban cycle by reduction of _Aedes aegypti_ that might be present.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Uganda can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18593>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18593>.]
