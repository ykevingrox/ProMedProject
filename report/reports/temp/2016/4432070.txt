If we can understand the factors that contribute to these increases, we can prepare for them and act to mitigate the impact of the disease,"" said Cummings.The dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes in the tropics and subtropics, affecting an estimated 390 million a year globally. Though there is no specific pharmaceutical treatment, supportive therapy can greatly improve outcomes. A number of vaccine candidates are in development stage but none is currently licensed.

If higher temperatures are accompanied by lower precipitation and water shortage, home inhabitants may store more water for household use, providing more breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]
