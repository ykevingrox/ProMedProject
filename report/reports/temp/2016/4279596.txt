It routinely is found afflicting humans as well as its normal livestock and wildlife hosts. This outbreak is presently in the hands of the physicians. Hopefully, the public health people will back trace on these patients and possibly others yet to be noted and, with their veterinary colleagues, find the source.It is clear that Odisha needs an effective anthrax livestock control and surveillance programme to reduce the risks to both livestock and the people of Odisha.Rayagada is in southern Odisha, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayagada_district>. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>.]
