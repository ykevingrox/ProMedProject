A discussion of these issues can be found in prior ProMED-mail posts (e.g., Pertussis - USA (14) 20151110.3781837 and Pertussis - USA (02) 20130905.1923593).Eddy County, with a population of 53 829 residents, is located in the U.S. state of New Mexico; its county seat and largest city is Carlsbad (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_County,_New_Mexico>).
