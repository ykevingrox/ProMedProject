As the Eid-ul-Azha draws nearer, health experts are advising citizens to take special preventive measures to avoid contracting the virus.Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Congo virus or handling specimens from them should implement standard infection control precautions, they advised.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The CCHF case count and fatal cases have increased in Pakistan during recent weeks. It is important that as the affected individuals have been identified to be animal handlers, shepherds and butchers, the human and animal health officials involved in the investigation of suspected cases and various control measures should focus on sensitization of the risk group as well as the general public. The health care workers who may have close contact when these individuals present to hospitals should also be provided relevant information on personal protection and infection control for this disease, which is mainly spread through contact and not aerosols. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1299>.]
