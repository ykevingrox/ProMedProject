Korea], some 46 km north of Seoul, the official said, citing information from health authorities.The cats were found dead earlier this week, 2 km from a chicken farm where the strain of the virus was 1st reported last month [November 2016].It marked the 1st infection of AI in mammals in South Korea since February 2015 when the country reported the infection of bird flu in a dog.Health authorities said that they are looking at samples to verify whether they were infected with a more highly pathogenic strain of AI.""Even if it is the same N6 strain, there are some differences in gene structure,"" the official said. ""We are awaiting test results.""South Korea is struggling to contain the spread of bird flu that has led to more than 20 million chickens and ducks nationwide being culled since mid-November [2016].Earlier in the day [Sat 31 Dec 2016], Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who also serves as acting president, called for all-out efforts to curb the fast-spreading avian flu. ""We should swiftly carry out culling in affected areas while taking pre-emptive measures to prevent additional outbreaks of AI,"" he said at a meeting designed to discuss ways to control bird flu.--Communicated by:Nati Elkin <nati@poultrymed.com>[HPAI H5N6, which is known to infect humans as well, has been spreading in S. Korea since mid Nov 2016, affecting poultry and wild birds. The possible impact of its spread to other mammals, such as felines, upon human health is yet to be evaluated.In the past, sporadic cases of felines infected by another HPAI virus, namely H5N1, were reported from Indonesia and Israel (see in ""see also"" section below).Subscribers are encouraged to refer to WHO's risk assessment of H5N6 as a zoonosis at 20161212.4689184. - Mod.AS][Maps of South Korea can be seen at <https://www.google.es/search?q=map+of+south+korean+Pocheon&biw=1517&bih=735&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv2sXu7Z7RAhWIOSYKHXNJBUMQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=vHJ6ib8XFsNuLM%3A> - CopyEd.ECA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195>.]
