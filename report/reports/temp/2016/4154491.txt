GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology Network) [edited]<http://www.gideononline.com>[Re: ProMED-mail Lyme disease - UK: human, canine, feline, spread, alert 20160411.4152209]----------------------------------------------------------------------The following background data on Lyme disease in the United Kingdom were abstracted from Gideon <http://www.GideonOnline.com> and the Gideon e-book series [1,2]. Primary references are available on request.Time and place--------------Lyme disease is reported from East Anglia, Scotland, Wales, Yorkshire, and Northern Ireland. Highest incidence is associated with popular holiday destinations such as Exmoor, the New Forest, the South Downs, parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire, Thetford Forest, the Lake District, the Yorkshire moors, and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. ""Hot spots"" for the disease include the New Forest and the Southwest region. 45 percent of reports originate in 3 contiguous counties in southern England: Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Dorset. This area includes foci in and near the New Forest and Salisbury Plain. Other counties with a relatively high incidence include Devon and Somerset in southwestern England; and Norfolk in East Anglia.Incidence---------Reporting [incidence] rates in the United Kingdom are approximately 39 percent of true incidence (2011). Case reports peak in the 3rd quarter of each year, which accounts for 48 percent of all cases.In the following graphs, I've contrasted case numbers and [incidence] rates per 100 000 in the United Kingdom, with those reported in Ireland and the United States. Note that highest incidence in the United Kingdom is reported from England and Wales; and highest [incidence] rates per 100 000 from Scotland. Reported [incidence] rates in the United States are approximately 2.5-fold those of Scotland. See graphs at <http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/lyme.jpg>.Infections due to _Borrelia burgdorferi_, _B. afzelii_, and _B. garinii_ are identified._Borrelia valaisiana_ and _B. afzelii_ have been identified in ticks in Scotland.Prevalence surveys------------------- 23 percent of patients referred to an infectious disease unit for suspected Lyme disease (2006 to 2010)- 2.3 percent of dog ticks in the United Kingdom (2009)- 4.2 percent of ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_) in England (2014 publication)- 0.5 percent of pet-dog ticks (2012 publication)- 0 percent of tick larvae, 2.14 percent of nymphs, and 0 percent of adults in South London parks (2015 publication)- 8.6 percent of ticks in the Scottish Highlands (both _B. afzelii_ and _B. burgdorferi_, 1997)- 37 percent of ticks in wooded areas of southern Wales- 8.6 percent of Highland ticks in Scotland (_Borrelia burgdorferi_, 1997)- 5.6 percent of questing tick nymphs in Scotland (_Borrelia burgdorferi_, 2012 publication)- 11.9 percent of grey squirrels in Scotland (_Sciurus carolinensis_, 2015 publication)Seroprevalence surveys----------------------- 2.5 percent to 4.0 percent of blood donors in South England- 0 percent to 0.5 percent of blood donors in the inner-city- 25 percent of forestry workers in endemic areas (1989 publication)- 14.3 percent of farmers in Northern Ireland (1990 publication)- 6.5 percent of individuals in the Scottish Highlands (2004 to 2006)- 23 percent of wild deer in England and Wales (2012 publication)Reservoirs----------Grey squirrels (_Sciurus carolinensis_ Gmelin) and pheasants (_Phasianus colchicus_ Linnaeus) are important hosts for _Ixodes ricinus_, and may serve as amplifying hosts for _Borrelia burgdorferi_ in this country.Seropositive horses are found in most parts of the UK.References----------1.
