Taipei Times [edited]<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/03/28/2003642628>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [27 Mar 2016] advised the public to apply insect repellent and wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts when walking in rural or mountainous areas during the upcoming Tomb Sweeping Festival [5 Apr 2016], as the prevalence of scrub typhus -- a mite-borne infectious disease -- often sees an uptick in April.Scrub typhus is caused by the bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ and is transmitted by the bite of a chigger, the centers said.The incubation period of scrub typhus is about 9 to 12 days, with symptoms including a persistent high fever, headaches, swollen lymph nodes and a rash that begins about one week after the fever. An eschar -- a dry, dark scab or falling away of dead skin -- often develops at the site of the chigger bite, the centers said.An increase in scrub typhus cases begins to be reported in April and May which peaks in June and July, the centers said, adding that according to data from 2013 to last year [2015], Penghu County, Taitung County, and Kinmen County had the most reported cases.Snake bites _________In addition to hundreds of scrub typhus cases reported every year, the centers said that more than 1000 snake bites are reported every year, and that snakes begin to become more active in March.Poisonous snakes most commonly seen in Taiwan include the Chinese green tree viper, the pointed-scaled pit viper, and the Chinese sharp-nosed viper -- commonly known as the ""hundred-pacer"" -- the banded krait, the common cobra, and the Russell's viper, it said.In order to prevent both scrub typhus and snakes, the centers advises people to wear light colors and apply government-approved insect repellent, and refrain from staying in overgrown areas for too long.People bitten by poisonous snakes should try to remember the snake's shape and color, remain calm, and get to a hospital as soon as possible, the centers said.A makeshift bandage can be made with a sock or other elasticized material, and a splint can be formed from a stick or other piece of available wood, while wounded limbs should be raised above the heart, the centers added.[Byline: Lee I-chia]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm>).Tomb Sweeping Day (Qingming Festival) of 2016 falls on 4 Apr 2016. The holiday in China takes place from 2-4 Apr 2016 (<http://www.travelchinaguide.com/essential/holidays/qingming.htm>). It is a traditional Chinese festival when people tend to family graves and pay respect to the dead person with offerings. The dead person's favorite food and wine are taken, along with paper resembling money, which is burned in the hope that the deceased are not lacking food and money. Weeds around the tomb are cleared away and fresh soil is added to show respect for the dead. It is also a time for outings to appreciate the spring season. In Taiwan, the public holiday is now always observed on 5 April to honor the death of Chiang Kai-shek on that day in 1975 (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival>).A map of Taiwan counties can be found at <http://www.24point0.com/ppt-shop/taiwan-map-powerpoint-presentation> and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>. - Mod.MLAbout snake bites - 2 things to consider: the country has 16 species of poisonous snakes (which makes it difficult when it comes to choose what anti-venom sera should be used) and it is spring and snakes are coming out from hybernation. 6 species are particularly dangerous: the Taiwanese krait (hemorrhagic venom), the Taiwan cobra (hemorrhagic venom), the Siamese Russell's viper (hemorrhagic and neurotoxic venom), the Taiwan habus (neurotoxic venom), the Taiwan bamboo viper (neurotoxic venom), and the Chinese moccasin (neurotoxic venom).- Mod.PMBGo to Google Images to see photos of these species. - Mod.JW]
