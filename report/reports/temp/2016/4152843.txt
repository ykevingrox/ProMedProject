Coast Week [edited]<http://www.coastweek.com/3915-agriculture-03.htm>Tanzanian health authorities are struggling to contain an anthrax outbreak which has already killed one person, with 4 others being hospitalized in the country's northern region of Kilimanjaro.Regional Medical Officer Ntamwa Mwako said on Wednesday [6 Apr 2016] that Rombo district in Kilimanjaro Region is one of the highly affected areas in northern part of the east African nation. ""We've managed to control the outbreak in the region; so far we have only 4 patients admitted in hospital, and they are responding well to treatments,"" the official said. ""We almost controlled anthrax, and our team of experts continues to monitor closely the 197 residents who are suspected to have had contact with the dead person,"" Mwako said. ""We are still working on the number of animals that died because of the disease.""Anthrax spores are spread by dust, carrion-eating birds and grazing animals, causing fever and rapid death. Humans are normally infected only by handling the carcasses, skins or wool of infected animals.According to Meck Sadik, the Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner, 197 people are being monitored closely by health specialists after they had eaten meat of cattle which died of anthrax.In response to the outbreak of the disease, the regional authorities called for a massive vaccination program. Animals which are lined-up for the vaccination exercise include cattle, goats, sheep and pigs. The regional government also banned transportation of animals to neighboring Kenya, particularly during immunization exercises.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a map of Tanzania, go to: <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/tanzania_pol_2003.jpg>. Kilimanjaro is in the middle of the northeast border of Tanzania with Kenya. For a description of Rombo district, go to: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rombo_District>.Anthrax is not contagious, so just being in the company of a clinically affected person is not a risk. Having shared their meals or handling their dirty clothes is another matter.This report adds a little to what we know already. They have some 197 people being monitored for symptoms but it seems not receiving any oral antibiotics in case some might be incubating disease. When there is a concern, usually 3 days of doxycycline is adequate to terminate any incubating infection. The vaccination of local livestock is planned but has yet to take place. I hope that they have a team in place to deal promptly and properly -- burn the carcasses -- with any that die in the interim. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34109>.]
