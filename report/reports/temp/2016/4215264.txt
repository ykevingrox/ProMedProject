However, he did not seek post dog bite vaccination to deactivate the virus then.A few days back, he developed classical symptoms of rabies, including fear of water and air, following which he was admitted to civic-run Naidu Infectious Diseases hospital here [Pune, Maharashtra].""[The patient] gave a definite history of dog bite on his left hand 5 years ago and no other contact with any known rabid canine subsequently. He could not provide history of vaccination or medical attention at that time. During the clinical examination, he was anxious and scared at the sight of water, flow of air under a fan, and had photophobia,"" said a doctor from Naidu hospital. He died of the infection in the last week of April [2016], he added.As per the medical history produced by the victim's relatives, he had not taken the anti-rabies vaccination on the scheduled days. Also, he was not administered rabies immunoglobulin, a readymade antibody which is extremely effective in deactivating the virus in category III dog-bite injury.Experts said the unusually long incubation period of rabies virus is a known fact. However, awareness about it is very low. ""The importance of proper wound care and post-exposure vaccination must be reinforced to prevent rabies,"" they said, while highlighting the need for health education programmes for the medical community and public for the same.Neurologist Rajas Deshpande of Ruby Hall Clinic, who had examined the patient, said, ""During my post-graduation, I had come across a patient who developed rabies infection 8 years after he received a dog bite. The unusually long incubation period of rabies, till 20 years, is documented in medical literature. Although it is very rare.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Multi-year incubation periods of rabies are extremely rare, but cannot be ruled out. The diagnosis of the case described above is based upon clinical observations; laboratory confirmation could have added some weight. According to the WHO rabies disease card, the incubation period of rabies varies, ""typically 1-3 months, but may vary from less than 1 week to more than 1 year.""(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/>).According to OIE's rabies disease card, the incubation (in animals) varies ""from a few days to more than 7 years"" (for the purposes of the OIE Terrestrial Code, the incubation period is considered to be 6 months). See at <http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/RABIES_FINAL.pdf>.In a review covering human rabies in the Philippines during the period 1987 to 2006, 8 (0.4 percent) of the investigated cases were of 5 years incubation, and one much longer; see ref 1 below.Recently, a case which apparently underwent an 8-year incubation time was reported from the USA (ref 2). Its abstract follows:""Eight years after emigrating from Brazil, an otherwise healthy man developed rabies. An exposure prior to immigration was reported. Genetic analysis revealed a canine rabies virus variant found only in the patient's home country, and the patient had not traveled internationally since immigrating to the United States. We describe how epidemiological, phylogenetic, and viral sequencing data provided confirmation that rabies encephalomyelitis may present after a long, multiyear incubation period, a consideration that previously has been hypothesized without the ability to exclude a more recent exposure. Accordingly, rabies should be considered in the diagnosis of any acute encephalitis, myelitis, or encephalomyelitis.References----------1.

Songkhla, Samut Prakarn, Kalasin, and Chonburi provinces have the highest number of cases. Puppies aged between 3 and 6 months are the main carriers.Local livestock offices are offering pet owners free rabies vaccines and sterilization. Veterinarians have advised those bitten or scratched by a dog or a cat to clean their wounds and see a doctor immediately.Those spotting animals that appear sick, crazed, or vicious must inform community leaders or livestock officials at once.--Communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[Globally, estimates indicate that human mortality (due to endemic canine-mediated rabies) is highest in Asia, with the highest incidence and deaths reported in India. This is closely followed by Africa; however, estimates of burden have always been uncertain due to the absence of reliable data (<http://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/en/>).Based on 2007 data, after India and Viet Nam, Thailand has the 3rd highest number of rabies in Asia although more recent data shows the situation is improving. Dog bites are by far the most common cause of rabies in Thailand. Between 2003 and 2012, there were a total of 166 confirmed human cases. Although the trend shows a decrease in number of confirmed cases reported, there are many cases that are not diagnosed and the estimates of rabies cases in Thailand as in many other countries are much higher (<http://www.searo.who.int/thailand/news/wrd2013/en/>).Rabies is a 100 percent vaccine-preventable disease. Countries embarking on rabies elimination programs have successfully experienced marked reductions, often progressing to the elimination of rabies. Elimination programs often revolve around mass dog vaccination campaigns, where at least 70 percent of the dog population should be covered in order to break the cycle of transmission in dogs, and to humans. Safe, effective vaccines can also be used for pre-exposure immunization in people. Post-exposure prophylactic vaccinations are required for treating individuals who have had no previous immunization. The reduced volume required by intradermal vaccines, in comparison to the intramuscular vaccine, results in cost savings of 60-80 percent. Intradermal vaccination may be a more cost-effective option for high-flow clinics where the disease is endemic (<http://www.who.int/rabies/about/en/>).Maps of Thailand can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5089>. - Mod.ST]******[3] China (Henan): rabies during pregnancy, neonatal riskDate: Thu 28 Apr 2016Source: Newser [edited]<http://www.newser.com/story/224215/rabies-kills-a-pregnant-woman-son-finds-better-fate.html>Thanks to widespread vaccination campaigns across most of the developed world, very few people or their dogs in those areas contract rabies, which is almost always fatal in humans. But in parts of the world where vaccination rates remain far lower, rabies claims tens of thousands of human lives a year. Fortunately, one such case in China has a silver lining.As scientists report in the Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins Including Tropical Diseases, a 25-year-old pregnant woman in Henan province who was infected by a dog she didn't know had rabies gave birth to a healthy, uninfected boy -- just before the virus claimed her own life. Researchers posit that the placenta played a protective role, but they note there were still ample opportunities for the virus to pass to the child, particularly during delivery.""The prompt administration of vaccines and anti-rabies immunoglobulin to the infant may have also contributed to his survival,"" they write. The rabies virus has a ""well-earned reputation for its brutal ingenuity,"" Medical Daily notes. After taking over most any warm-blooded mammal's central nervous system, causing excessive salivation and aggression, it then hides out in the salivary glands, where it provokes its host to bite or scratch another creature and keep the vicious cycle alive. And while the researchers report that there are only 6 other documented cases of a pregnant woman with full-blown rabies delivering a baby, 5 of those 6 newborns did survive. Their mothers weren't so fortunate.[Byline: Elizabeth Armstrong Moore]--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs from HealthMap Alerts<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[The reference for the article cited above isQu ZY, Li GW, Chen QG, et al: Survival of a newborn from a pregnant woman with rabies infection.

Post-exposure prophylaxis must be instituted at the earliest in all cases of exposure. - Mod.UBAThe infant was lucky but from what I remember of the pathology of this disease, the virus travels along nerves. There are no nerves from the mother to the foetus. - Mod.MHJA recent (2016) paper describes 2 relevant cases, in Benin and Cambodia, including a literature review (ref 1). Its abstract follows.""We report 2 cases of probable rabies in near-term/at-term pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. One baby was delivered by caesarean section and the other one vaginally. Both received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), including RIG [rabies immunoglobulin] and vaccine and both are alive and healthy, at 9 and 24 months, respectively. We found 14 other published cases of infants born from rabid mothers. One confirmed case of rabies transmission occurred. The other children born from rabid mothers, with or without caesarean section, did not acquire rabies, and were still healthy at the time of reporting, with or without post-exposure prophylaxis. Mother-to-child transmission of rabies is possible, but rare, because rabies virus is not present in blood and exposure of the baby's mucosa to maternal infectious fluids and tissue seems limited. A conservative approach should however, be adopted, and rabies PEP, including RIG, be administered as soon as possible to babies born from probably rabid mothers. Whether cesarean-section clearly provides prevention remains unclear. Rabies can be prevented in pregnant women by PEP administration. Rabies cell-culture vaccines are safe and effective and can be administered to pregnant and lactating women, as well as newborns. Efforts must focus on raising rabies awareness in the general population, as well as in healthcare workers.""Reference---------Aguemon CT, Tarantola A, ZoumÌ¬nou E, et al: Rabies transmission risks during peripartum -- Two cases and a review of the literature.
