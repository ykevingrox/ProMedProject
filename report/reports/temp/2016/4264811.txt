A team of officials, including divisional forest officer (buffer) Mahalinga and local rangers rushed to the spot and found the body in a highly decomposed state. The postmortem of the body, as mandated by the standard operating procedure to ascertain the possible reasons for death, could not be done as veterinary doctor Harelal Mahato declared the body to be unfit for the same.The Palamu reserve does not have any veterinary doctors in on its roll; Mahato was called in from the local government veterinary hospital. The forest officers then buried the carcass at the spot. ""It seemed that the baby elephant had died a week ago. We were informed late. It was a male aged nearly 3 years,"" Mahalinga said. He, however, did not share any speculations over the reason for the elephant's death. However, forest officials said the animal's carcass bore no injury marks and its trunk was intact. Elephant expert and member of the state wildlife board Dr DS Srivastava said, ""As the carcass bore no injury marks, it might have died of some disease, probably spread by the domestic buffaloes who roam freely in the wild even in the highly sensitive core areas of the reserve.""""The rampant grazing by herds of buffalo, if allowed to continue unabated, can wreck havoc for the elephant population in the reserve,"" Dr Srivastava said. ""These buffalos are the prime carriers of diseases like anthrax that can prove deadly to over 130 elephants in the reserve."" The forest officials, however, did not reply to queries in this regard.[byline: Vishal Sharma]--communicated byProMED -mail<promed@promedmail.com>[Elephants suffer a wide range of diseases and the young can die suddenly. Anthrax is just one of many possibilities. Also, as this park appears to not have a history of elephant anthrax and there are no reports of domestic buffalo anthrax in the area prior to or since this dead youngster was found, one must be cautious in ascribing an anthrax diagnosis. A word of advice: when presented with a rotting carcass good samples for testing can be taken from the bloody soil under the carcass. Swabbing elephant turbinates presents problems with elephants unless you are willing to cut open the upper nasal area to insert a swab.Jharkhand is in NE India on the northern side of Odisha.

We are very grateful for the excellent rapid responses we received to this request to help validate this media report. Below is a synthesis of some of the responses received. - Mods.MHJ/MPP]- Animal Specimen results are awaited, but 2 human specimen tested at Microbiology Laboratory, Rajendra Institute of Medical Science were found to be culture positive for _Bacillus anthracis_.--communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberPriyakanta Nayak EIS Officer NCDC, Delhi- Anthrax outbreaks are going on in both human and animals in Jharkhand. This was verified by colleagues posted nearby and through newspaper reports (online versions). Unfortunately exact details were not available, including on the suspected case. If information becomes available it will be shared with the EpiCore Surveillance Project.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Again we are very grateful to the EpiCore members for their efforts in helping to validate this media report. Obviously this is a bigger problem than just one dead young elephant. We await updates as they become available. - Mods.MHJ/MPPMaps of India can be seen at<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18344>. - CopyEd.AO]
