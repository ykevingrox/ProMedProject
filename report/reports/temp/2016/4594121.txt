CTV News [edited]<http://windsor.ctvnews.ca/yellow-fever-mosquito-found-in-windsor-1.3136099>The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit says a yellow fever mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_] was discovered in Windsor [Ontario]. The health unit announced the news Friday morning [28 Oct 2016] and said it will continue to monitor the situation.This type of mosquito is thought to be responsible for the majority of human cases of the Zika virus worldwide.The health unit's Dr. Gary Kirk believes it's the 1st in Canada, but said there is ""no risk of the Zika virus.""Public health officials don't think the yellow fever mosquito can survive Canadian winters.Although it is unknown exactly how the larvae arrived in Ontario, one possibility is that the eggs were transported from the U.S. in shipping containers or other cross-border vehicle traffic.The eggs could also have been imported in recycled products, such as tires or other containers. Given that this is a tropical mosquito, the extremely hot temperatures this past summer allowed for the species to exist in Windsor.""We will continue to ensure that our community stays informed about infectious diseases and the local mosquito surveillance program. It is a key public health service that we provide to Windsor-Essex County residents.""The discovery of the yellow fever mosquito larvae through enhanced surveillance of the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito is an important reminder that we should continue to protect ourselves and our families from mosquito bites,"" Kirk said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As the public health officials indicated, _Aedes aegypti_ is not cold-adapted and will not survive the winter in Ontario. Killing frosts will occur soon, if they have not happened already, ending the threat that these mosquitoes will become established in the province. Interestingly, the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, was found for the 1st time in this same area this month [October 2016], which is why surveillance for this mosquito was being conducted. _Ae. albopictus_ is capable of entering diapause, and may be able to survive the winter there. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>.]
