TVNZ [edited]<https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/third-measles-case-confirmed-in-wellington>A total of 3 cases of measles have been confirmed in the Wellington region, the most recent being a child at Miramar School. The regional public health authority has sent a letter to 700 schools and early childhood centres in the region warning them to be on the look-out for symptoms of the illness.The period of extra vigilance ends on Fri [12 Aug 2016], 2 weeks after the child with measles was last at school. If a child is diagnosed with measles, all other students and staff at the school need to provide a vaccination record to be allowed to attend or must stay away for at least 2 weeks.This year 5 cases of measles have been notified in the Wellington region. In 2015 there were no cases.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of New Zealand may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Botswana, Nambia, vaccinationDate: Tue 9 Aug 2016, 3:06 PM (GMT +2)Source: MmegiOnline [edited]<http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=62146&dir=2016/august/09>Botswana will continue with its ongoing measles/rubella (MR) vaccination campaign, despite reports from Namibia of deaths among some children injected with the vaccines.Yesterday [Mon 8 Aug 2016] assistant health minister Alfred Madigele said the campaign was going well and had not resulted in any deaths or serious challenges. ""The campaign is going very well. We have not registered any deaths associated directly with the vaccination and de-worming. In fact, the only challenge we encountered was a shortage of de-worming tablets at some point in some districts, but that has since been rectified,"" he said.Madigele said government is happy with the number of those bringing their children forward for vaccination. ""The interim reports show promising numbers. We are also happy that private schools have also been working with us in addition to public schools,"" he said.The campaign, which started on 25 Jul [2016], ends on 12 Aug [2016]. The campaign is targeted at children aged between 9 months and 14 years.Namibian newspapers last week reported that parents whose babies died after they were vaccinated have approached that country's Legal Assistance Centre for help to sue the Ministry of Health and Social Services. According to The Namibian newspaper, 21 babies countrywide have died since 2006 after receiving the vaccines, which are normally administered to children at 6 weeks and 12 weeks [This seems unlikely -- too early. Our previous posting (Measles update (35): Ireland (GY), Botswana vaccine shortage 20160730.4382060) said the campaign was ""targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years of age"". Clarification from an informed source would be welcomed. - Mod.SH]. The deaths have been termed sudden infant death syndrome. ""A total of 5 of these cases recorded in July this year [2016] in Windhoek alone were caused by complications arising from the ongoing MR vaccination exercise,"" the paper reads.According to the newspaper, Dr Theopolina Tueumuna, a veteran Namibian medical doctor with expertise in public health, specialising in maternal and child health, defended the campaigns, saying in Namibia's case, most children are malnourished and when they get the vaccination there is a likelihood that some might die. She compared Namibian children to those she attended to in London, whom she said were well nourished, lived in good houses, had access to supportive treatment, and plenty of nutritious food.Madigele said in districts where there is malnutrition, parents are requested to bring the children back for check-ups so they can be helped on time if there is a problem.[byline: Innocent Selatlhwa]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Common side effects from the MMR vaccine include low-grade fever, skin rash, itching, hives, swelling, reddening of skin, and weakness. Serious adverse events following MMR vaccination include seizures, severe headaches, double vision, vomiting, joint pain, or pain in the digestive system.There have also been 397 deaths reported to Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in association with the MMR vaccine. However, the numbers of vaccine-related injuries and deaths reported to VAERS may not reflect the true number of serious health problems that occur develop after MMR vaccination.Even though the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 legally required pediatricians and other vaccine providers to report serious health problems following vaccination to federal health agencies (VAERS), many doctors and other medical workers giving vaccines to children and adults fail to report vaccine-related health problem to VAERS. There is evidence that only between 1 and 10 per cent of serious health problems that occur after use of prescription drugs or vaccines in the United States are ever reported to federal health officials, who are responsible for regulating the safety of drugs and vaccines and issue national vaccine policy recommendations. Excerpted from <http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/measles/measles-vaccine-injury-death.aspx>.It is not clear whether Nambia and Botswana have the same reporting requirement in place as the US, so the total number of deaths following vaccination may be higher. It is likely that malnutrition and consequent poor health contributed to the children's deaths following vaccination in Nambia.See ProMED-mail: Measles update (35): Ireland (GY), Botswana vaccine shortage 20160730.4382060 reporting vaccine shortage in Botswana, although that is not mentioned in this current report.A map of Botswana may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/169>.A map of Nambia may be found at <https://www.expertafrica.com/namibia/google-map> - Mod.LK]
