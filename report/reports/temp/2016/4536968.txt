Without having provided an explanation about what happened there a month [ago]. We remember, [Fri 2 Sep 2016], AP-HP had decided to suspend the issuing of milk [from the] milk bank in Ile-de-France, attached to the Necker Hospital, with batch recall. And that, we were told, [was done] in close cooperation with health authorities. In short, an important decision, which followed 3 cases of _Bacillus cereus_ infection [in premature newborns] in 2 of its neonatal services since [6 Aug 2016]. This is a common bacterium found in the environment, most of the time harmless, but can have serious consequences in some very preterm or very vulnerable people. 2 of the newborns were very premature, and are dead.The case, at the time, had been widely reported in the media, as if negligence was suspected. Since [3 Sep 2016], a series of investigations have been conducted by the operational hygiene teams of the AP-HP, for the [National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products], ANSM, well as the [Regional Health Agency], ARS Ile-de-France [regional health agency], in connection with the coordination center of the fight against infections associated with care-North.A thorough analysis of medical records of newborns was conducted to check for other common sources. Bacteriological analysis to identify the existence or not of factors common to different contaminations occurred, including genetic comparisons of the strains identified in newborns, in milk, or in the environment [genotyping the isolates].No answer, no certainty in any case. ""We do not know,"" said Professor Claire Poyart, who runs the microbiology laboratory at the Cochin hospital. ""Our work has shown that the 3 children were affected by the different strains. Tests at the Pasteur Institute and in the bacteriology laboratory of the Cochin hospital have failed to find common source among strains identified in newborns, milk or the environment. ""She adds: ""No microbiological analysis establishes the responsibility of the milk from the milk bank in the detected cases.""As this bacillus is everywhere, everything is possible. [The organism] can be found in soil, water, and plants. It can survive the heat. It can contaminate food and be responsible for food poisoning in humans, usually benign. We do not know more. The bacilli have stories, sometimes unknown. And this ignorance should lead the various actors in a little modesty, despite spectacular advances in molecular biology.[Byline: Eric Favereau]--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for submission of the news report above.The report above refers to an outbreak of _Bacillus cereus_ infection in 3 premature newborns, which was fatal in 2 of the newborns since August 6 2016 (ProMED-mail post Bacillus cereus - France: (Paris) fatal, susp contam banked breast milk prems, RFI 20160909.4476947). Breast milk from Paris's Necker hospital was suspected to be the source for this outbreak.However, the report above says that genetic comparisons of the strains identified in the 3 newborns, in milk, and in the environment found that the strains from the 3 newborns were different and genotyping failed to find a source among strains identified in milk or in the environment. But, we have not been told certain details: did the affected infants have _B. cereus_ bacteremia or some other syndrome? Was the banked milk that was tested the same as the milk consumed by the affected newborns? What were the other environmental sites tested, such as intravenous nutrition solutions?_B. cereus_ can cause food poisoning that is frequently associated with the consumption of rice-based dishes, and can also cause traumatic and post-surgical wound infections, bacteremia, central nervous system infections, respiratory tract infections, eye infections, and endocarditis, especially in intravenous drug abusers, immunocompromised patients, and those with prosthetic implants, such as orthopedic implants and cerebrospinal shunts.ProMED-mail has posted a report of an outbreak of _B. cereus_ bacteremia in premature infants secondary to receiving _B. cereus_-contaminated intravenous nutrition (ProMED-mail posts Bacillus cereus, nosocomial - UK: (England) prematures, bacteremia 20140605.2520815 and Bacillus cereus, nosocomial - UK (03): (England) prems, bacteremia 20140707.2592173). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1871>.]
