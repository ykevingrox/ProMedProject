Classified as a primary case with no history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The tally of numbers of cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia is now 1440, including 606 deaths (reported case fatality rate 42.1 percent). This most recent case is reported from Buraidah in Qasim province, where there had been a nosocomial outbreak back in March/April 2016 when there were 34 reported cases. Of note is that the index case in the recent nosocomial outbreak in Riyadh reported on 15 Jun 2016 was from Buraidah City, also classified as a primary case with no history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. These sporadic cases classified as primary but without a history of contact with camels highlights the need for further studies on transmission of the MERS-CoV, especially in Saudi Arabia where these cases are occurring frequently. Of the 25 cases classified as primary cases reported since the beginning of June 2016, 6 gave a definitive history of no contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset, 8 were still under investigation for camel contact history, 7 had a definitive history of direct contact with camels, and 4 had a history of indirect contact with camels -- thus 14 (56 percent) did not give a clear history of known contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.A map showing the location of Buraidah in Saudi Arabia can be found at the source URL.

Feasibility of using convalescent plasma immunotherapy for MERS-CoV infection, Saudi Arabia. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016 Sep [22 Jul 2016]. <http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2209.151164>AbstractWe explored the feasibility of collecting convalescent plasma for passive immunotherapy of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection by using ELISA to screen serum samples from 443 potential plasma donors: 196 patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection, 230 healthcare workers, and 17 household contacts exposed to MERS-CoV. ELISA-reactive samples were further tested by indirect fluorescent antibody and microneutralization assays. Of the 443 tested samples, 12 (2.7 percent) had a reactive ELISA result, and 9 of the 12 had reactive indirect fluorescent antibody and microneutralization assay titers. Undertaking clinical trials of convalescent plasma for passive immunotherapy of MERS-CoV infection may be feasible, but such trials would be challenging because of the small pool of potential donors with sufficiently high antibody titers. Alternative strategies to identify convalescent plasma donors with adequate antibody titers should be explored, including the sampling of serum from patients with more severe disease and sampling at earlier points during illness.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The paucity of antibody rich serum several months following confirmed MERS-CoV infection is intriguing, and may explain why retrospective studies have not revealed higher levels of individuals with past infection with the MERS-CoV. It's curious that other studies have suggested that the use of serologic testing to identify MERS-CoV infected individuals are more sensitive than the use of rRT-PCR tests (see Arwady MA, Alraddadi B, Basler C, Azhar EI, Abuelzein E, Sindy AI, et al. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission in extended family, Saudi Arabia, 2014.
