Saudi MOH [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-06-19-001.aspx>As of noon today [19 Jun 2016] there have been a total of:1413 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including593 deaths [reported case fatality rate 42.0%],790 recoveries, and30 currently active infections [including 18 asymptomatic infections].In the past 24 hours there have been:3 newly confirmed symptomatic cases,0 newly reported fatalities, and0 newly reported recoveries.Information on newly confirmed cases:1- A 32-year-old Expat female from Riyadh, healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker.2- A 42-year-old Saudi male from Riaydh, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Classified as a secondary household contact.3- A 44-year-old Saudi male from Najran, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Classified as a primary case, history of contact with camel currently under investigation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Evidence of continued transmission of MERS-CoV in Riyadh continues with the confirmation of 2 new cases in Riyadh, one in a healthcare worker, the other in a household contact. In addition, there may be signs of increased transmission of MERS-CoV in Najran, where another case, also classified as a primary case, with ongoing investigation into whether there was contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.Returning to the possible ""index case(s)"" in Riyadh, from the information in the WHO update below, the earlier possible case was an 85-year-old female who was at home for 5 days prior to hospitalization, with a 24-hour space between hospitalization and confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. The 2nd possible index case in Riyadh was a 49-year-old female from Buraidah City (where there had been a nosocomial outbreak back in March 2016 (see prior ProMED-mail updates during this period) who was symptomatic for 24 hours prior to hospitalization, and was in the hospital for 48 hours preceding confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.We await further information on the epidemiologic investigations into this ongoing outbreak in Riyadh, and possible connections to the earlier outbreak in Buraidah (perhaps ""silent transmission"" continued in Buraidah for approximately 2.5 months).A map showing the locations of the newly reported cases today [19 Jun 2016] can be found at the source URL.As a reminder, Buraidah is the capital of Al Qassim province, located 317 km (197 miles) from Riyadh. The hospitalization of a patient from Buraidah city in Riyadh serves as a reminder of the high mobility within the country, especially for seeking presumed tertiary medical care.A map of Saudi Arabia showing major cities and provinces can be found at <http://www.emapsworld.com/images/saudi-arabia-political-map.gif>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia - WHO updateDate: Sum 19 Jun 2016Source: WHO Global Alert and Response Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/19-june-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Between [15 May 2016 and 15 Jun 2016], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 6 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.Details of the cases:1- A 49-year-old female from Buridah city developed symptoms on [9 Jun 2016] and was admitted to a hospital on [10 Jun 2016].

As a reminder, since 15 Jun 2016 there have been 25 additional newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections including 18 asymptomatic infections in Riyadh.Reviewing the WHO updates -- which provide details on dates of onset of illness, dates of hospitalization, and dates of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection -- illustrates the possible gaps in suspicion of MERS-CoV as an etiology, both in the community as well as in the hospital environment. These gaps may be intervals where possible transmission to others can occur. Patients are symptomatic at home at times for prolonged periods when household transmission can occur. Once hospitalized, one suspects that MERS-CoV specimens are routinely sent for undiagnosed febrile illnesses, but it is not clear what level of infection control is routinely applied prior to receipt of confirmation of infection.Reviewing the 6 cases in the above WHO update:Case 1, as previously mentioned in the above Moderator comment, was symptomatic at home for 24 hours preceding hospitalization and was in hospital for 2 days prior to receipt of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.Case 2 was symptomatic at home for 5 days preceding hospitalization and was in hospital for 2 days prior to receipt of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.Case 3 was symptomatic at home for 4 days preceding hospitalization and was in hospital for 2 days prior to receipt of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.Case 4 was symptomatic at home for 5 days preceding hospitalization and was in hospital for 2 days prior to receipt of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.Case 5 was symptomatic at home for 5 days preceding hospitalization and was in hospital for one day prior to receipt of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.Case 6 was symptomatic at home for 4 days preceding hospitalization and was in hospital for 2 days prior to receipt of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
