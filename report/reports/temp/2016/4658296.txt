G1 Globo [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2016/11/cinco-casos-de-virus-mayaro-sao-detectados-no-amazonas-em-2016.html>In 2016, 5 cases of Mayaro virus [infection] were detected in patients residing in Amazonas [state]. The virus is transmitted by _Haemagogus janthinomys_, a forest mosquito native to the Amazon region, that causes a disease similar to chikungunya [virus infection]. Recent research discovered the possibility that the virus can also be transmitted by urban vectors such as _Aedes aegypti_.According to the FundaÌ¤Ì£o de Medicina Tropical [researcher] Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD), the 5 cases identified were found in a research project of the institute in collaboration with Fiocruz [Oswaldo Cruz Foundation] Amazon, which began in 2015. The objective was to identify the types of viruses that cause acute febrile syndromes in patients that live in 3 municipalities of the state.At that time, just one sample collected in the city of TefÌ© was positive for Mayaro. In 2016, however, 685 samples were collected from patients presenting with acute febrile symptoms. Of those cases tested, 5 gave positive Mayaro results. One [positive] sample was identified in January, 3 in February, and one in March. The Foundation told G1 the they did not register any cases where Mayaro [virus] was found in _Aedes aegypti_.Mayaro virus was discovered in 1954 in a forested area in Trinidad [Brazil] called Mayaro, stated Felipe Pessoa, a vector researcher at Fiocruz Amazon. According to him, research found Mayaro [virus] genetic material [sequences] in _Aedes aegypti_ from Mato Grosso [state], within AmazÌ«nia Legal [the largest socio-geographic division in Brazil]. ""[The research was conducted] by a team of the Universidade Federal of Mato Grosso. They found Mayaro [virus] genetic material [RNA sequences] in _Aedes aegypti_,"" he said. We are still trying to understand what is happening,"" he explained.Despite this discovery, Pessoa said that more research is needed in order to understand if _Aedes_ is, in fact transmitting Mayaro [virus]. He classifies the situation as an ""academic curiosity"", in that the mosquito must pass through various steps to be shown to be a vector [of the virus]. ""For a mosquito to be shown to transmit the disease [virus], it is necessary that the virus replicate in the vector, pass trough a non-infectious [non-transmissible] phase, and then migrate to the salivary glands. In order to say that it is a vector, it is necessary to detect these subsequent steps."" he said.The researcher in Fiocruz Amazon is coordinating an ecological study of forest mosquitoes, including _Haemagogus janthinomys_ the mosquito that transmits Mayaro [virus]. It is small, dark colored, typical of forests, and has diurnal habits. During the study of vectors, the researchers collect the mosquitoes, analyze the environments where they are collected, pool them, and organize the collected material to test them later for presence or absence of the virus.Mayaro fever is a disease that begins with a nonspecific fever and fatigue. Also, red blotches [rash] may arise over the body, accompanied by headache and joint pain. Because they are symptoms similar to those of chikungunya fever, the diagnosis must be made through laboratory tests.According to FMT-HVD [Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado Tropical Medicine Foundation], laboratory diagnosis of Mayaro [virus] infection is made by serological methods, IgM Elisa, in cases of acute febrile syndrome after the 6th or 7th day after symptoms begin.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There are many unanswered questions concerning the geographic occurrence of Mayaro virus (MAYV) in the Amazon Basin and the amount of febrile disease it is causing. The occurrence of Mayaro fever in Amazonas state is not new. In a previous study, 600 blood samples from Manaus residents with high fever were tested. In 33 cases, the presence of Mayaro virus was confirmed and 4 patients presented with mild bleeding, something that has never been described before for Mayaro fever (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110222.0587).As mentioned in the recent report of Mayaro virus in Haiti, the detection of the virus there for the 1st time raises further interesting questions. Given its ability to be transmitted by a variety of mosquitoes and to infect a variety of vertebrates -- can it be maintained in a wide variety of ecosystems in the Americas in addition to the Amazon Basin? Is it endemic in Haiti, but previously undetected? Is it present but so far undetected in other Caribbean islands, given its initial discovery in Trinidad and now, presence in Haiti? The discovery of MAYV in Haiti indicates that it needs to be included in the battery of diagnostic tests of febrile diseases.As Mod.JT noted in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20110222.0587), ""Mayaro fever is a zoonosis produced by an arbovirus. Mayaro virus (MAYV), of the _Alphavirus_ genus, _Togaviridae_ family, is endemic in tropical areas of South America (Trinidad, Suriname, French Guyana, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela). The transmission cycle is very similar to yellow fever virus, with primates as reservoirs and haemagogus mosquitoes as vectors. Human cases are associated with recent exposures to humid forest environments that the vectors inhabit.""He continued, ""Although to date no urban outbreaks of Mayaro fever have been described, MAYV is capable of replicating in _Aedes albopictus_ cells [C6-36 cells] in culture. Also, it is possible to infect _Ae. aegypti_ under laboratory conditions after ingestion of a moderate [virus] dose orally and later transmit the infection [virus] to hamsters. It is estimated the capacity for MAYV urban transmission depends in large measure on the magnitude and duration of viremia in humans in relation to the susceptibility of _Ae. aegypti_ to the virus. However, no data are available for these critical aspects.""Because of the clinical similarities of MAYV, chikungunya, and dengue virus infections, one cannot help but wonder how many MAYV infections in the South American tropics are incorrectly attributed to dengue virus in the absence of laboratory confirmation.
