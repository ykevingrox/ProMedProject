Now a growing number of evacuees from Fort McMurray [Alberta, Canada] are coping with a microscopic stomach bug.An outbreak of suspected viral gastroenteritis has doubled to 105 cases as of [Tue 10 May 2016] from 40 to 50 a day earlier among people evacuated from harm's way as fires threatened Fort McMurray and other communities, said Dr Chris Sikora, Edmonton zone senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services.Sikora said the increase in case numbers isn't alarming. ""Viral gastroenteritis usually has an incubation period of half a day to 2 days from time of exposure to time of developing symptoms,"" Sikora said. ""This isn't unexpected.""There are about 75 cases at the Northlands Edmonton Expo Centre, with the rest at other evacuee reception sites. Sikora did not identify the other locations for privacy reasons. As of [Tue 10 May 2016], there were 407 people lodged at the Expo Centre, but 11 700 people are registered to use the facility for food, clothing, and other needs.Viral gastroenteritis is an intestinal infection marked by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.People showing symptoms are being kept in a separate hall of the Northlands facility. Medical staff are at the site to offer assistance. Cleaning of washroom and shower facilities has been stepped up and the supply of hand sanitizer has been boosted. Evacuees are also being reminded to wash their hands with soap and warm water before and after washroom visits, before eating, and after changing diapers.Sikora said for most people the illness will be no more serious than a nuisance and replenishing lost fluids is key.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including:- Noroviruses: Both children and adults are affected by noroviruses, the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities. It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces. In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water, although person-to-person transmission also is possible.- Rotavirus: Worldwide, this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths. The infection is most severe in infants and young children. Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms, but can still spread the illness -- of particular concern in institutional settings because infected adults unknowingly can pass the virus to others. A vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries, including the United States, and appears to be effective in preventing the infection.See <http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-gastroenteritis/basics/causes/con-20019350>The city appears to be taking the best preventative measures it can in such a difficult situation. - Mod.LKMaps of Canada can be seen at <https://canadaalive.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/canada_political_map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/732>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
