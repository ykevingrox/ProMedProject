Both are in a stable condition in hospital.SA Health is warning South Australians to ensure they have measles vaccinations before going on holidays. ""Measles is highly contagious among people who are not fully immunised, and is spread through coughing and sneezing,"" SA Health's chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said. ""Measles is common in South East Asia so it is vital that people travelling to those regions check that they have had 2 doses of measles vaccine before leaving home.""The illness brings on symptoms such as fever, coughing, a runny nose and sore eyes, as well as a blotchy rash on the head and body. Professor Phillips warns people suffering similar symptoms should contact their GP prior to visiting to prevent the spread. ""We are especially encouraging people to check their vaccination records and request the vaccine if there is no record of them receiving 2 doses,"" he said.People born in Australia in mid-1960s to mid-1980s have commonly only had 1 vaccine. There have been 4 confirmed cases of measles this year [2016] in South Australia, compared to 4 in total for all of last year [2015].--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[After 1 dose of measles vaccine, 85 per cent of children 9 months of age and 95 per cent over 12 months of age are immune.
