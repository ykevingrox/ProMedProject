Kiambu News [edited]<http://www.hivisasa.com/kiambu/news/149815>A middle aged man from Kihingo village in Riabai ward died on Monday [20 June, 2016] after [butchering] a cow that had died of anthrax. He is reported to have been called by 1 of the neighbors few days before his death, to slaughter a cow that had just died.His wife said that he came home after he finished [butchering] the cow and said the lungs of the dead cow were swollen. Few hours later, he developed rashes that started swelling. It was at this point that his wife went out to look for a vehicle to take him to the hospital and upon her return to the house, the husband had passed on.The sister to the deceased said that she met with him on his way home from his [butchering] business and he told her that the meat was carried by a ""boda boda"" and he was not aware where it had been taken to.The widow urged the county's veterinary department to start doing inspection rounds in people's homes to avoid such deaths, saying that the meat of the dead carcass could be sold to unsuspecting buyers. ""Veterinarians should start making rounds in this area because if that was the case, the incident we had would not have occurred. Right now, nobody knows where the meat was taken to, and maybe it will be sold to people who do not know that the cow had anthrax.""This is not the 1st time incidences of humans dying after eating [or having contact with] meat from an anthrax-infected cow in Kiambu.[Byline: Pharis Kinyua]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Kiambu is North West of Nairobi; see <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/22/Kihingo.html>Anthrax is a frequent occurrence in Central Kenya with 13 bovine outbreaks in 2010, 2011 (4), 2012 (4), 2013 (3), and in 2014 (8), with sheep outbreaks in 2010 & 2012, and pigs affected in 2010, 2011, & 2012.The incubation period for anthrax is in inverse relation to the exposure dose. To have died so quickly -- the normal incubation period is 3-4 days -- means that his exposure was very high if we assume the man died of anthrax and not just with anthrax. Further information and disease confirmation would be appreciated. A ""boda boda"" is a motorcycle taxis commonly found in East Africa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda_boda>. - Mod.MHJ]
