The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/suspected-outbreak-of-monkey-fever-in-khanapur-taluk/article8360485.ece>At least 20 persons are suspected to have been infected by monkey fever [Kyasanur Forest disease] in 4 villages nestled in forest areas of the Western Ghats under Kankumbi Primary Health Centre jurisdiction in Khanapur taluk [Karnataka] adjoining Goa.While 10 patients were undergoing treatment at Goa Medical College & Hospital in Bambolim and other hospitals in Goa, 2 had been admitted to the government hospital in Khanapur town and 8 others in Primary Health Centres of the taluk. The condition of all the 20 patients is stable and there was no threat to their life, said District Health Officer Appasaheb Naratti.He said all the 20 patients were daily-wage labourers frequenting Goa for livelihood. Preliminary investigations indicated that they were infected during their stay in Goa, where the Kyasanur Forest disease (a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to South Asia), commonly known as monkey fever, has griped villages of Sattari taluk situated on the State's eastern side adjoining Khanapur taluk.It may be recalled here that one of the infected patients, a 60-year-old woman from Mauxi [Goa], succumbed to the disease at GMCH in Goa January this year [2016]. The Goa Health Department had already undertaken immunisation in all the affected villages to prevent spread of the disease.The fever, contracted by the Khanapur taluk patients during their stay in the affected areas of Goa during the preceding week, is so far confined to 4 villages under the Kankumbi PHC jurisdiction, including Amte and Chapoli. The serum samples of the patients had been sent for tests to Pune-based National Institute of Virology.Dr. Naratti, who along with his team visited and engaged his staff to create awareness among the residents of all the 4 villages, said there was no immediate threat of further spread of disease. Yet, immunisation as a preventive measure could be taken up if the tests results were positive. Vaccine for prevention of the disease was available with the department, he said adding the monkey fever incidence was more in the form of morbidity than mortality.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st report of cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) reported in Kanataka near the border with Goa where there has been an ongoing outbreak since 2015. All 20 of these suspected cases appear to have been infected in neighboring Goa although KFD is endemic in Karnataka as well.As noted in the previous posts, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case fatality rate is 3-5 per cent (see the CDC fact sheet at <http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html>).Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although monitoring ticks for KFD virus provides information for issuing alerts, the only means for prevention of infection is avoidance of tick bites.Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf>).Maps of India showing the location of Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala, the states where KFD virus is endemic and cases have been occurring over the last year, can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/states/> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/301>. - Mods.TY/MPP]
