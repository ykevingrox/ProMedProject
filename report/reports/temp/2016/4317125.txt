Ministry spokesman Ly Sovann yesterday [27 Jun 2016] referred questions to an official at the national program, who declined to give his name, citing the ongoing investigation, but said teams were dispatched on Sat [25 Jun 2015] to investigate the suspected cases and collect blood samples.The 2 cases involve an 8-month-old in Phnom Penh's Por Sen Chey district and a 1-year-old in Svay Rieng province, he said. ""Any suspected cases should be investigated,"" he said. ""Right now it's not clear yet."" Officials are still awaiting the lab results.In March 2015, the World Health Organization declared Cambodia ""measles free"". Just 10 months later, in January of this year [2016], a case emerged involving a 7-month-old infant in Kampong Speu province. Another case was subsequently confirmed that same month [January], according to ministry documents, while a 3rd was uncovered in May [2016]. It's unknown where the other 2 confirmed cases this year took place.[Byline: Yesenia Amaro, Bun Sengkong]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is worth clarifying that the 1st 2 confirmed cases in January 2016 were from Kampong Speu and Takeo provinces, while the 3rd confirmed case in May 2016 was also from Phnom Penh's Po Sen Chey district.The Cambodia Early Warning System (CAMEWARN) of the Ministry of Health operated by the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) Department uses syndromic surveillance, whereby any case of ""fever with rash"" should be promptly investigated to rule out measles or rubella. Once either is confirmed, a joint press release between the MOH and WHO will be issued.With the support from the Skoll Global Threats Fund through its iLab in Phnom Penh, the CDC Department is in the process of a nation-wide rolling out of the Verboice (a tool to create and run projects that interact via voice) to facilitate a timely and complete disease reporting from the peripheral level as part of its leading role in Information, Communication Technology (ICT), among the 6 countries of the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) Cooperation (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam).The CDC Department is also the Cambodia National Focal Point for the International Health Regulations (IHR).Maps of Cambodia can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/z77fez4> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/145>. - Mod.ST]******[2] UK (England): secondary schoolDate: 28 Jun 2016Source: BBC [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-36655707>A total of 13 cases of measles and another 10 probable cases have been found at a Devon [UK] secondary school. Parents at King Edward VI Community College (Kevicc) in Totnes have been urged to get their children vaccinated. The outbreak was confirmed by Public Health England (PHE). It warned that while most people who catch measles recover within weeks, it can cause permanent disability and ""occasionally even kill""- Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known and can only be prevented through vaccination.- About 1 in 5 children with measles experiences complications such as diarrhea, vomiting, pneumonia and meningitis.- While measles can lead to life-threatening health problems in some people, it usually passes within 7-10 days- Symptoms include a runny nose, coughing, sore red eyes, a fever and small grayish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks[source: National health service]The outbreak follows 1 case of measles confirmed in a Kevicc pupil on 3 June [2016]. There have been 785 cases of measles since the start of 2016 in England and Wales, compared with 646 in the same period last year [2015] said PHE [Public Health England]. PHE has also sent letters to parents at other schools in the area advising them to ""ensure their children are fully protected"" with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Concerns were raised in a controversial paper in the Lancet in 1998 about a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, which has since been comprehensively discredited. But in the wake of the publicity surrounding the Lancet paper vaccination rates fell sharply and some parents are still concerned about the effects, said PHE.Dr Sarah Harrison, consultant in health protection for PHE in the South West, said: ""Measles is a very infectious disease and can spread rapidly among communities such as schools if people have not been fully immunized."" About 1 in 15 children with measles will suffer from complications such as pneumonia or ear or eye infections.""I would appeal to any parents who have not yet had their children immunized to get them protected as soon as possible through their GP."" Alan Salt, principal at Kevicc, said: ""The college urges parents and carers to make sure they follow Public Health England and GP advice and ensure their children are vaccinated.""[Byline: Jonathan Morris]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
