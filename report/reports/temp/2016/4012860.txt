Harry Hull <hfhullmd@gmail.com> [edited][Re: ProMED-mail Hepatitis B - USA (02): injection drug use, comment 20160206.3999152]----------------------------------------------------------------------Dr Jones comments that, because the average age of hepatitis B cases is 40 while the average age of hepatitis C cases is 30, it will be some time before we see the impact of infant immunization on hepatitis B transmission among injection drug users. An alternative interpretation of this data is that since routine immunization of infants against hepatitis B began 20+ years ago, immunization is already having the desired impact by preventing cases among drug users in their teens and early 20s. The net effect would then be that the average age of hepatitis B cases would rise, while the average age of hepatitis C cases would not. I agree that it will be some time before all hepatitis B transmission, both through injection drug use and other routes will be eliminated.--Harry F Hull, MD<hfhullmd@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Dr Hull for his comments. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
