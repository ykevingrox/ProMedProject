Marianas Variety [edited]<http://www.mvariety.com/cnmi/cnmi-news/local/90277-chcc-issues-hand-foot-mouth-disease-advisory>Commonwealth Healthcare Corp. [CHCC] Chief Executive Officer Esther Muna says there have been 7 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) confirmed at the Commonwealth Health Center's emergency department in the past month, and 1 case at the hospital's Children's Clinic.But there have been no cases identified since 20 Oct 2016, she said.HFMD is a viral infection that can be spread through close personal contact, coughing or sneezing, contact with feces or sharing of straws, cups, and other contaminated surfaces.It is usually a mild, common childhood disease with limited consequences, according to CHCC.""The viral illness usually affects infants and children younger than age 5.""Of the 8 cases diagnosed at CHC in the last month, 5 or 63 percent were under the age of 5.""Sometimes adults can get the illness, but this is much less common.HFMD symptoms include a fever, reduced appetite and sore throat.One or 2 days after the fever, painful sores can develop in the mouth (called herpangina). They are usually in the back of the mouth as small red spots that blister and become ulcers. A skin rash with red spots and at times blisters can occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.""Not everyone will develop all the symptoms. Some people may show no symptoms but still pass on the virus.""According to CHCC, ""A person with HFMD is most contagious during the 1st week of illness.""There is no vaccine for HFMD, but members of the public can prevent/reduce their risk of being infected by:- Washing their hands often with soap and water.- Cleaning and disinfecting touched surfaces including toys.- Avoid close contact including kissing, hugging, or sharing utensils/cups with a person suffering from HFMD.""For the painful mouth sores, you can use over-the-counter mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain. Take over-the-counter Tylenol or Ibuprofen to relieve pain and fever. Aspirin should not be given to children.""Community members are advised to stay home if they have HFMD. Talk to your primary care doctor if you are unsure when you should return to work. It also applies to taking children back to school and/or daycare.[Byline: Bryan Manabat]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Northern Mariana Islands (United States) can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/381>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Grenada: daycare and preschoolsDate: Thu 27 Oct 2016Source: Jamaica Observer [edited]<http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Health-ministry-confirms-outbreak-of-hand--foot-and-mouth-disease-in-Grenada>The Ministry of Health on Thursday [27 Oct 2016] confirmed reports of an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) at some daycare and preschool centres across the island [Grenada, in the Caribbean].Chief Medical Officer, Dr George Mitchell, says the ministry has received reports of 12 cases and going forward public education and direct intervention will be the main focus.""Several education/information brochures relating to the disease are being distributed in electronic and print format to the various institutions,"" Mitchell said in a release.Medical practitioners have also been reminded that the disease is endemic in Grenada and they need to notify the ministry once a case is diagnosed.Records at the Ministry of Health indicate that during the same period last year [2015] there were similar outbreaks of the disease among toddlers.""Already, health surveillance and public health teams are gathering information and at the same time responding to reports of mild outbreaks among children at daycare and pre and primary schools.The release said while a decision has not been made to close the institutions, health authorities are reminding parents and operators of daycares and kindergartens that frequent hand washing is still the best way of managing the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Grenada can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34>. - Mod.LK][HFMD is frequently reported, and is generally a mild disease, predominantly of children. It is often caused by coxsackie virus A16, but other enteroviruses may be implicated. Virus spreads quickly in daycare and other such facilities, increasing risk for children in that age group. They usually build up immunity to the virus after being exposed, but older children and adults may become infected. - Mod.LKHealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at:Northern Mariana Islands [United States]: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/381>Grenada: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34> - Mod.MPP]
