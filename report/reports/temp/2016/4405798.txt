""Now, we almost have control over the situation.""Thein Zaw told The Irrawaddy that about 100 people have been infected by the disease from 2 townships, Lahe and Nanyun; the vast majority are from Lahe, with 15 patients reportedly from Nanyun.On [5 Aug 2016] -- after media, including The Irrawaddy, reported on the outbreak, relaying what was locally perceived as an ineffective governmental response -- authorities from the Naga Self-Administered Zone sent around 20 medics to the Lahe village of Thankholama to treat the victims and identify the illness. After locals tested positive for measles, the medics began administering vaccines to villagers on [Sat 6 Aug 2016]; it was in Thankholama where the disease first appeared in June [2016]. ""The medics gave out vaccines in the villages where the disease broke out, and even gave vaccines to [other] villagers who stay in the nearby area,"" Thein Zaw said.Lahe Township's Naw Aung Sann, the general secretary of the Council of Naga Affairs, said that of the 3 children who passed away on 6 and 7 Aug 2016, one was 2 years old and another was a 2 month old baby. Both victims were from Thankholama village, where The Irrawaddy reported on 5 Aug 2016 that most of the community's 50 households had been affected by the outbreak. At the time of reporting, no information was available about the 3rd young victim.Naw Aung Sann said that both the medics and the authorities had stopped villagers from traveling outside of their communities, lest they possibly spread the disease to other unvaccinated individuals.The rural areas of Lahe and Nanyun townships have little to no health care or transportation infrastructure, and are incredibly difficult to access. The Naga Self-Administered Zone, populated by the Naga ethnic group, is considered one of the poorest and most under-developed areas in Burma [Myanmar].""The government has not been able to provide enough medics, and no one wants to stay in these areas, as it is hard to live and travel there. So the local people have poor knowledge of health care,"" Naw Aung Sann explained. ""If the government could have provided vaccines on time, measles would not have broken out,"" he added.Measles is caused by a virus and spreads when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, making it highly contagious. It is widely prevented by the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is delivered in infancy [Usually after 1 year of age, so not technically in infancy. - Mod.SH]. According to the World Health Organization, high rates of vaccination worldwide have greatly reduced the number of outbreaks, but deaths from measles still occur throughout Africa and Asia. Treatment includes supportive care, such as rehydration and control of the patient's fever.[byline: Lawi Weng]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Naga Self-Administered Zone, as stipulated by the 2008 Constitution, is a self-administered zone consisting of 3 townships in Sagaing Region of Myanmar (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_Self-Administered_Zone>).This current measles outbreak, now with 41 case fatalities, is likely a consequence of poor vaccine coverage resulting from an inadequate health infrastructure.

That has prompted a warning from Regional Public Health to local schools about the dangers of contracting the illness.One child, a teen and an adult have all been treated for English measles after their holiday last month [July 2016].According to Wellington's medical officer of health, 2 doses of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine is the best protection against measles. A similar warning was made to Brisbane travellers who shared a flight with the trio, leaving Bali's Denpasar Airport via Brisbane Airport bound for Wellington on [Sun 24 Jul 2016]. Health officials in Wellington are not taking any chances. They have been in contact with travellers in nearby rows to tell them about the potential danger.Regional Public Health has also issued a warning to parents about the highly infectious illness. If measles cases have been found at a school, all students and staff would need to have written evidence either of vaccination or of a previous case of measles, diagnosed by a doctor. Otherwise, they would need to stay away from school for 2 weeks after their last contact with an infectious case.Medical officer of health Annette Nesdale said the 3 confirmed cases had come from 2 families. ""I think one of the interesting things this illustrates is around travel. People check with their doctors around typhoid and polio and other diseases before they travel, but not about measles. Measles is quite common in quite a few countries that New Zealanders go to, particularly in South East Asia, and we do also see occasional outbreaks in Australia, the UK, and other countries.""Measles is a highly infectious virus that can spread easily from person to person through the air, and can affect both children and adults. While the blotchy rash can be the biggest sign a person has measles, there are periods where they are asymptomatic, but remain contagious to others. ""That's what makes measles so complex, in terms of the follow-up, because when people think of measles they think of that rash, but people are contagious for 5 days before that rash comes out. Measles tends to start with a high fever, some aching, feeling unwell, maybe a cough, runny nose, or sore red eyes and the rash comes out about 5 days later."" Nesdale said the best way to prevent getting measles is by having 2 doses of the measles vaccine, known as MMR, one month apart. Measles immunisation is free.Measles facts-------------- Highly contagious and easily preventable- Affects both children and adults- Initial symptoms include fever, a cough, runny nose, sore and watery ""pink"" eyes- A blotchy rash can be seen from day 3 to 7 of the illness- 2 vaccinations provides the best protection against measles- It can take 10-14 days for someone to show symptoms- If you catch measles, you are infectious 5 days before and 5 days after the rash appears- Measles can cause ear infections, diarrhoea, pneumonia, seizures and brain swelling- Contracting measles during pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage.[byline: Katarina Williams]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It would be good for all doctors to recommend vaccination against measles if patients have not been immunized, whether traveling or not. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of New Zealand may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5379> and of Bali at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/556>.]******[4] Uganda (Kamwenge, Kamuli districts)Date: Tue 9 Aug 2016Source: New Vision [edited]<http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1432165/measles-outbreak-kamwenge-kamuli>The Ugandan health ministry has announced an outbreak of measles in ""some parts of the country"". A number of cases have been confirmed in Kamwenge and Kamuli districts, the ministry said in a statement. Specific areas where measles has been reported include the sub-counties of Butandisi, Nawanago, Balawoli, Nabwigulu, and Kamuli Municipality.An airborne disease, measles affects mainly children between the age of 6 months and 10 years. But it can also affect adults.Kamwenge is facing a 2nd outbreak of the disease which has been attributed to a number of factors. The ministry says that some of these factors include the high influx of refugees from neighbouring DR Congo, religious cults like the Triple 6, cultural attachments and attitudes towards health services.The government is understood to be undertaking a number of measures to control further spread of the disease:- increased measles surveillance- conducting sensitization programmes to educate masses about the signs, symptoms, and dangers of the disease- undertaking mass immunization programmes of childrenIn the wake of the outbreak, the Ugandan public is urged to:- avoid direct contact with children infected with measles- report and immediately take any suspected children to nearby facilities- take children for immunization in health facilitiesProf Anthony Mbonye, the health ministry's acting director general health services, also announces the outbreak of rubella in Awei sub-county, Aleptong district in Lango sub-region. As many as 5 samples have so far been received, ""3 of which tested positive for rubella and negative for measles"". Rubella, an infection caused by the rubella virus, is characterized by fever, sore throat, and fatigue. A rash that is sometimes itchy may appear after 2 weeks.The ministry advises the public to ""remain vigilant and report all suspected cases to the nearest health facilities"".[byline: Carol Natukunda]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Uganda may be found at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>There appears to be not only measles (caused by rubeola virus) activity in some areas of Uganda, but also German measles (caused by rubella virus). Rubella or ""3-day measles"", is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash.Rubella is not the same as measles (rubeola), though the 2 illnesses do share some characteristics, including the red rash. However, rubella is caused by a different virus from measles, and is neither as infectious nor usually as severe as measles.Rubeola virus is in the genus, _Morbillivirus_, family _Paramyxoviridae_, order _Mononegavirales_. Paramyxoviruses are enveloped virions (virus particles) varying in size from 150 to 200 nm (1 nm = 10^-9 metre) in diameter. The paramyxovirus genome is made up of a single strand of negative-sense nonsegmented RNA (ribonucleic acid).Rubella virus is the sole member of the genus _Rubivirus_ in the family _Togaviridae_. The virus is a spherical, 40 to 80 nm, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with spike-like, hemagglutinin-containing surface projections.The measles,mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, usually given to children twice before they reach school age, is highly effective in preventing rubella. The signs and symptoms of rubella are often so mild they're difficult to notice, especially in children. If signs and symptoms do occur, they generally appear between 2 and 3 weeks after exposure to the virus. They typically last about 2-3 days [thus the nickname ""3 day measles""] and may include mild fever of 102 deg F (38.9 deg C) or lower; headache; stuffy or runny nose; inflamed, red eyes; enlarged, tender lymph nodes at the base of the skull, the back of the neck, and behind the ears; a fine, pink rash that begins on the face and quickly spreads to the trunk and then the arms and legs, before disappearing in the same sequence; aching joints, especially in young women.Excerpted from <http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rubella/basics/definition/CON-20020067>. - Mod.LK]
