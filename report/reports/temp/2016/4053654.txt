Saudi MOH [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2016-02-26-001.aspx>As of noon today [26 Feb 2016] there have been:1305 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including554 deaths [reported case fatality rate 42.5 percent]9 currently active cases.In the past 24 hours, there have been a total of:2 newly confirmed cases;0 newly reported deaths;0 newly reported recoveries.Information on 2 newly reported cases:1- A 72-year-old Saudi male from Ruwaidah alard, non-healthcare worker, reported to be in critical condition; is reported to be a primary case with no history of contact with camels.2- A Riyadh 68-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh, non-healthcare worker, reported to be in stable condition; is reported to be a primary case with no history of contact with camels.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Cases continue occur in Saudi Arabia. With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases, there have been a total of 22 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection since 1 Jan 2016, of whom 17 were reported to be primary infections, 13 of whom had a history of direct or indirect contact with camels. Presumably, the definition of a primary case without history of contact with camels are those cases with no known contact with other known MERS-CoV infected cases in either the healthcare environment or in the community. It would be nice to see results of a case-control study directed at defining high-risk exposures among these individuals. Are any underway?The locations of these cases can be seen on the map available at the source URL. It appears as though Ruwaidah alard in not far from Riyadh, perhaps in Riyadh province, perhaps not far from Al-kharj (see <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SA/10/Ad_Dubayah.html>).The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
