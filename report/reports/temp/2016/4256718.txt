NLTimes [edited]<http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/05/31/74-people-killed-q-fever-outbreak/>The official death toll of people affected by Q-Fever since the outbreak in 2007 now stands at 74, an increase of 26 since the number was last updated, NU.nl reports.The reason for the increase in deaths can be attributed to patients still carrying the live bacteria after the 2007 outbreak. The disease has symptoms of fever, headache, muscle aches and a decreased heart rate, among other things.According to Annemieke de Groot, managing director of foundation Q-support, it is still important for doctors to remain alert and be able to recognize the symptoms. The foundation will explain the increased death toll at a conference at the Brabant provincial house in Den Bosch on 20 June 2016.The Q-Fever outbreak in the Netherlands in 2007 is considered one of the largest outbreaks of this disease in the world. Thousands of people in the Netherlands fell ill. The disease is usually transmitted from animals to humans.[Byline: Janene Pieters]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Netherlands suffered a large epidemic of Q fever which started in 2007 and continued until 2010, manifested by thousands of human cases, most of them due to infection by aerosols originating in aborting dairy goats. The efforts undertaken to get the spread under control included mass tests on dairy goats and sheep farms, the slaughter of some 40 000 goats, mass vaccinations in goats and sheep and various agrotechnical measures, in particular addressing the treatment of farms' manure.While assessment of the above reported Q fever-related fatalities is delayed until full data are published (20 Jun 2016), the following (summarized) abstract of a 2014 paper (Ref 1) may be helpful.Abstract--------""From 2007 to 2010, the Netherlands experienced a large Q fever outbreak, which has offered a unique opportunity to analyze chronic Q fever cases. In an observational cohort study, baseline characteristics and clinical characteristics, as well as mortality, of patients with proven, probable, or possible chronic Q fever in the Netherlands, were analyzed. In total, 284 chronic Q fever patients were identified, of which 151 (53.7 percent) had proven, 64 (22.5 percent) probable, and 69 (24.3 percent) possible, chronic Q fever. Among proven and probable chronic Q fever patients, vascular infection focus (56.7 percent) was more prevalent than endocarditis (34.9 percent). An acute Q fever episode was recalled by 27 percent of the patients. The all-cause mortality rate was 19.1 percent, while the chronic Q fever-related mortality rate was 13 percent, with mortality rates of 9.3 percent among endocarditis patients and 18 percent among patients with a vascular focus of infection. Increasing age (P equal 0.004 and 0.010), proven chronic Q fever (P equal 0.020 and 0.002), vascular chronic Q fever (P equal 0.024 and 0.005), acute presentation with chronic Q fever (P equal 0.002 and P < 0.001), and surgical treatment of chronic Q fever (P = 0.025 and P less than 0.001) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality and chronic Q fever-related mortality, respectively.""One genotype of _Coxiella burnetti_ was predominantly present in the Dutch dairy goat population; and it was suggested that this genotype probably played a key role in the epidemic. It was found that strains with the same genotype showed differences in virulence.The draft genome sequence of the human isolate has been published in 2015 (Ref 2).On 21 Apr 2016, the complete genome sequence of _C.burnetii_ goat outbreak strain NL3262 and that of an epidemiologically linked chronic human strain, both having the outbreak-related CbNL01 multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) genotype, was published (Ref 3).References----------1.
