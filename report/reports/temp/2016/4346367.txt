Albawaba [edited]<http://www.albawaba.com/editorchoice/surprising-hajj-preparations-saudi-recommends-flu-meningitis-vaccines-pilgrims-862050>The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah urged all local Hajj pilgrims to get vaccinated 10 days before beginning their pilgrimage, Makkah newspaper reported.Both the flu and meningitis are quickly spread in close quarters and have the potential to be deadly. As people come from all over the world to participate in the pilgrimages, and stay in tight accommodations, the risk for a communicable disease spreading quickly is very high.Last year [2015], over 100 people in Iran died from swine flu [influenza A(H1N1) virus]. In 2000, over 200 people reported cases of meningitis after participating in the Hajj. The WHO conducted an investigation, and Saudi officials confirmed that the Zamzam well [in Mecca] was not the source of the outbreak.A source said the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah demanded all pilgrim service companies and Tawafa establishments [guiding pilgrims throughout Hajj in Mecca] to ensure that all of their pilgrims have taken the tetra vaccine [meningococcal quadrivalent vaccine offers protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135] and flu shots. ""The Ministry of Health pointed out that meningitis is spreading in African countries. The influenza virus is also active this time of year locally and internationally. Pilgrims must now submit a vaccination certificate that shows that they were vaccinated 10 days before entering the holy places,"" said the source.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Umrah and Hajj are pilgrimages to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, performed by Muslims. Umrah can be undertaken at any time of the year, in contrast to the Hajj. The days of Hajj in 2016 begin on Fri 9 Sep and end on Wed 14 Sep. The Hajj is compulsory for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it; the Umrah is not compulsory (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah>).Saudi Arabia issues its requirements for entry into Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, which are updated annually. The Hajj requirements for 2016 can be found at <https://www.saudiembassy.net/services/hajj_requirements.aspx>.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also outlined its recommendations for pilgrims during the Hajj (<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/select-destinations/saudi-arabia-hajj-pilgrimage>).
