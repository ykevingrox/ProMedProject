It is feared the sexually transmitted disease may be becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, prompting concerns further rapid spread could occur. In April [2016], it emerged an outbreak of so-called ""super-gonorrhoea"" had occurred in Leeds, with cases also noted in the West Midlands, London and southern-England. It began among heterosexual couples but has since been spread among men who have sex with men (MSM). In a report issued today [9 Sep 2016] by health agency Public Health England [PHE], the group warned: ""The outbreak of HL-AziR [high-level azithromycin-resistant] gonorrhoea in England persists. There have been 17 cases of HL-AziR gonorrhoea reported to date in 2016 compared to 15 cases for the same time period in 2015. Between November 2014 and August 2016 there have been a total of 48 confirmed and 2 probable cases.""The potential for rapid spread of HL-AziR _N[eisseria] gonorrhoeae_ among high risk sexual networks including MSM is of particular concern."" The disease can result in serious discomfort, pelvic inflammatory disease and even infertility. Among 1 in 10 infected men and half of infected women, symptoms can go undetected. Symptoms include a green or yellow discharge from the genitals, discomfort urinating and irregular bleeding between periods. Chief Executive of sexual health charity FPA Natika H Halil told The Independent: ""There should be statutory sex and relationships education, which the government has still not implemented, and easy access to sexual health services. With ever-shrinking public health budgets and increasing pressure on local authorities to meet people's varied health needs, this is no longer a given and is a cause of real concern.""PHE's report is a timely reminder, ahead of our Sexual Health Week focusing on STIs next week, how important it is for people to know how to protect themselves. It particularly highlights the importance of testing so that cases can be diagnosed early and as well as of partner notification to help limit infections being passed on. ""Through a survey we have conducted for Sexual Health Week, we know some people struggle to use condoms because they don't like how they feel and they impact on the pleasure of sex. However, condoms remain the best way to help prevent STIs being passed on.""[Byline: Siobhan Fenton]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 9 Sep 2016Source: Public Health England (PHE) Health Protection Report [HPR] Vol. 10, No. 30 [edited]<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/552058/hpr3016_hlzrg.pdf>Outbreak of high level azithromycin resistant gonorrhoea in England: an update------------------------------------------------------------------------------The outbreak of HL-AziR gonorrhoea in England, described in HPR in April [2016], persists. There have been 17 cases of HL-AziR gonorrhoea reported to date in 2016 compared to 15 cases for the same time period in 2015. Between November 2014 and August 2016 there have been a total of 48 confirmed and 2 probable cases (figure 1).The initial outbreak cases reported in Leeds were all heterosexual with the majority under 20 years of age. Between November 2015 and February 2016, cases were predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM), from a slightly older age range (18-31), with the majority resident in London or the South East. Since March 2016, cases have been mixed in terms of sexual orientation and geographically dispersed (figure 1).The potential for rapid spread of HL-AziR N. gonorrhoeae among high-risk sexual networks including MSM is of particular concern. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis suggests transmission between heterosexual and MSM sexual networks has occurred at least twice.The majority of cases linked to the Leeds outbreak (clade 1) share a recent common ancestor, but there are 2 other linked clades that share a more distant common ancestor (i.e. outside the timeframe of the outbreak investigation) with the clade 1 samples. Two of the 3 clades include heterosexuals and MSM. Further results from WGS analysis are awaited on recent cases.Few antimicrobials remain effective in the treatment of gonorrhoea. Current recommended therapy involves intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg in combination with azithromycin 1 g orally [1]. Gonorrhoea can develop resistance rapidly, therefore dual therapy is recommended because simultaneous development of resistance to both drug classes is unlikely, and 1st-line treatment will remain effective [2,3]. If azithromycin becomes ineffective against gonorrhoea, there is no ""2nd lock"" to prevent or delay the emergence of ceftriaxone resistance, and gonorrhoea may become untreatable. The 1st documented case in the world of gonorrhoea treatment failure to both ceftriaxone and azithromycin was reported in the UK in July this year [2016] [4].PHE has convened a Level 2 Incident Control Team to monitor and respond to the HL-AziR gonorrhoea outbreak. PHE has alerted clinicians in order to raise awareness of HL-AziR gonorrhoea via the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV network [5]. A National Resistance Alert was issued to all microbiologists in October 2015 to ensure that all gonococcal isolates are tested for azithromycin and ceftriaxone susceptibility, and that all resistant isolates (MIC greater than 0.5 mg/L for azithromycin, and greater than 0.125 mg/L for ceftriaxone) are referred to PHE Colindale for confirmation and follow-up.To help reduce dissemination of azithromycin resistant gonorrhoea, microbiology laboratories should:- screen all isolates of _N. gonorrhoeae_ for azithromycin resistance- refer all isolates categorised as azithromycin resistant (MIC greater than 0.5 mg/L) to PHE Colindale for confirmation (PHE does not charge for these tests)- promptly notify clinicians of any isolates with high-level resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/L)In addition, clinicians should:- ensure all patients with azithromycin resistant gonorrhoea, and especially those with high-level resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/L), are followed up and receive a test-of-cure, and that their partners are contacted and tested- be especially vigilant to potential treatment failure in their patients and report any cases where this is suspected through the treatment failure reporting form available on the HIV & STI web portal or the PHE gonorrhoea treatment failure webpage [<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reporting-gonorrhoea-treatment-failure>].References----------1.

However, between November 2015 and February 2016, cases have been predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM), with the majority resident in London or the South East. Since March 2016, cases have been mixed in terms of sexual orientation and geographically dispersed. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis has established 3 clades with transmission between heterosexual and MSM sexual networks that has occurred at least twice.Because of the experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance, combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action (i.e., ceftriaxone intramuscularly plus azithromycin orally as a single dose of each) has been recommended in the US and the UK to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, in the earlier ProMED-post (Gonococcal disease - UK: (England) azithromycin monotherapy resistance, RFI 20160103.3907866) we were told that some online pharmacies were offering only the oral azithromycin, rather than the recommended combination of intramuscular ceftriaxone plus oral azithromycin. We are not told if oral azithromycin was used alone in these cases of azithromycin resistance. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>.]
