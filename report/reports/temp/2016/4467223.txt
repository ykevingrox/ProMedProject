Web India 123 [edited]<http://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/India/20160904/2930651.html>The death toll in the recent spate of encephalitis cases rose to 224, as 5 more children died of this dreaded disease during the past 24 hours. Officials say all the deaths were reported from Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur.Official sources said that among 5 deaths reported today [4 Sep 2016], 2 each were from Gorakhpur and Kushinagar and one from Sant Kabir Nagar.Government records suggest that 920 patients of encephalitis have been admitted in BRD Medical College hospital since 1 Jan [2016], in which 224 kids have died so far. ""At present, 108 patients suffering from this disease are recuperating in the hospital,"" he said.The patients admitted to the hospital belonged to the districts of Gorakhpur, Deoria, Gonda, Basti, Sidharthnagar, Sankabrinagar, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Balrampur, Ghazipur, and Azamgarh, along with some patients from Nepal and Bihar.The area is endemic for Japanese encephalitis [JE], but in the past 6 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis [often termed acute encephalitis syndrome - Mod.TY], the exact cause of which is unclear. One possibility is a water-borne virus present in contaminated water, doctors say.The diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to comas, brain dysfunctions, seizures and inflammations of the heart and kidney.Doctors say children between the ages of 6 months and 15 years are worst affected, and most of the victims are poor from rural areas.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>The number of hospitalized patients increased from 188 on 28 Aug 2016 to the 224 mentioned above. As noted in earlier posts, Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in northeastern India, and cases occur there yearly during the transmission season. This report indicates that all the reported cases are JE only and does not attribute any cases to the non-specific acute encephalitis syndrome that has been reported in many previous reports from northeastern India. There is no indication of whether the JE cases reported above had been vaccinated, or whether a vaccination campaign in the state has been carried out in the recent past or is planned.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/320>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Nepal (Saptari)Date: Wed 24 Aug 2016 Source: The Himalayan Times [edited]<http://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/minor-dies-encephalitis/>Saptari [district in Province Two] locals have been terrorized after a child died of Japanese encephalitis in the district.A boy, 12, of Rajbiraj Municipality-9 died while undergoing treatment at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences [BPKIHS], Dharan, on [21 Aug 2016].Locals were terrified after doctors at BPKIHS declared the boy had died of Japanese encephalitis.The boy was admitted to Rajbiraj-based Sagarmatha Zonal Hospital on [31 Jul 2016] after he complained of fever, headache, and weakness. He was later taken to Biratnagar-based Life Guard Hospital on [4 Aug 2016] after he could not be treated at the zonal hospital.Senior Public Health Administrator at Saptari Public Health Office, Bijay Kumar Jha, said [YD] was again transferred to BPKIHS on [5 Aug 2016] as he could not be treated at Life Guard hospital as well.Following the minor's death, an emergency meeting of political parties, government office chiefs, and other stakeholders chaired by Saptari CDO [Chief District Officer] Baldev Gautam was held at the District Administration Office, Saptari. Jha said the meeting decided to administer preventive vaccinations and make the public aware about the disease.Residents of Saptari headquarters Rajbiraj fear that the disease might break out as the concerned authorities have failed to spray mosquito repellents in the area and while stray pigs roam about freely on the streets of the area. CDO Gautam stressed the need to launch a pig control campaign, as encephalitis can also spread from stray pigs. Despite repeated efforts, Rajbiraj Municipality has not succeeded in checking stray pigs in the area. Chairman of Civil Society Saptari Than Singh Bhansali said former CDO Hariraj Pant had checked stray pigs 5 years ago. ""The situation came under control for a few days then,"" Bhansali said.--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs from HealthMap Alerts<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[A Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination program alone will not suffice to prevent and control JE in endemic areas. Mass vaccination among the susceptible population, vaccination of the pig population in the endemic areas, as well as control of vector mosquitoes are key measures to reduce the burden of JE.Maps of Nepal can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal#Subdivisions> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55105>. - Mod.SN][The lowland tropical areas of Nepal are endemic for Japanese encephalitis. The vaccination status of the case above is not given, although JEV immunizations were carried out in the area. If the inactivated virus vaccine was used, the duration of immunity would not have been long lasting.Pigs are mentioned in the above report because they can serve as amplifying hosts for JEV. Birds, especially ardeids (herons), are reservoir hosts, and the mosquito vectors are several _Culex_ species.Effective mosquito vector control is very difficult. Vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only measures to prevent JE virus infections. - Mod.TY]
