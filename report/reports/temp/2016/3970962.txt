Asian Correspondent [edited]<https://asiancorrespondent.com/2016/01/el-nino-drought-thailand-malaysia-singapore/>Intense heat attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon is prompting fears of prolonged water crises and dengue outbreaks in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.Thailand----In Thailand, the government scrambled to build 4300 more wells to cope with the massive demand for water, reported Reuters. Thai farmers are contending with a drought and a water shortage that has lasted for months and is only expected to get worse before the rainy season begins in May [2016].Secretary of the National Water Board Suphot Tovichakchaikul said, ""We estimate that the end of this year's dry season is 30 May [2016]. The water we have now has to last for the next 4 months.""Water crises are not new or surprising to the country. Just last November [2015], authorities sounded the alarm about critical water levels at dams. At the time, 2 key dams which supply water to Bangkok faced water shortages. Kwai Noi Dam in Phitsanulok was at just 44 percent water capacity and Pasak Dam in Lopburi was at 52 percent capacity.The hot weather is also exacerbating the current dengue outbreak in Thailand. According to 1 report, dengue cases have quadrupled since a week ago. The country also recently saw the passing of popular TV star Thrisadee ""Por"" Sahawong due to complications related to dengue fever.Malaysia----In Malaysia, the dry season has raised the specter of water cuts and water rationing as implemented in 2014. In that year, hundreds of thousands of households -- mostly in Kuala Lumpur and the state of Selangor -- experienced water cuts due to depleted reservoirs.This time around, the government's meteorological department expects to see 20 to 60 percent less rain starting this month [January 2016] due to the El Nino phenomenon. The department's director-general, Che Gayah Ismail, categorises the current El Nino level as ""strong"" and said its impact will continue to be felt until April [2016].""The last time the country faced an El Nino phenomenon of this high intensity was in 1997 and 1998, where temperatures reached 40.1 deg C [104.2 deg F],"" she said.The Malaysian state of Selangor, which was hit by water cuts in 2014, said state dams had stored enough water to outlast the expected drought. Last week[week of 11 Jan 2016], official data showed that state dams are at a record high of 70 percent and above water capacity.Even so, just like in Thailand, Malaysia has seen a disturbing spike in dengue cases. The 1st week of 2016 saw a 1/3 increase in cases compared to the previous week. Furthermore, the Malaysian Health Ministry warned that the hot and dry El Nino weather could cause a 50 percent increase in cases.Singapore---Singapore has not been spared either the heat or the mosquitoes. Based on the 1st 2 weeks of 2016, Singapore is experiencing the hottest January ever recorded, with a mean temperature of 28.1 deg C [82.6 deg F]. More than 600 dengue cases were recorded there last week [week of 11 Jan 2016] -- the highest weekly figure since 2014.--Communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[In Thailand, the 2016 [dengue] caseload may be on par with the last large outbreak in 1987, when there were about 170 000 cases, said Dr Usa Thisyakorn, professor of pediatrics at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok and chairwoman of Asian Dengue Vaccination Advocacy (ADVA).""We have had a lot of patients in this season. It's a big predictor that we'll have a big problem with dengue this year (2016). If even in the cool season we have dengue, then it will be worse in the following year"" in the hot and rainy seasons, Usa said on the sidelines of the Asia Dengue Summit organized by ADVA (<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-dengue-vaccine-idUSKCN0US1IB20160114>).In Malaysia, there were 111 285 reported cases of dengue with 301 deaths for 2015 (as of 5 Dec 2016). This is 16.3 percent higher compared with the same reporting period of 2014 (n=95 693). From 29 Nov to 5 Dec 2015, there were 2119 cases of dengue reported, which is higher than the previous week (n=2087).In Singapore, a total of 11 298 cases of dengue have been reported for 2015 (data up to week 52, ending 2 Jan 2016), 61 percent lower than the number of cases reported in 2014 (n=18 168) for the same reporting period. From 27 Dec 2015 to 2 Jan 2016, 459 dengue cases were reported, higher than the previous week (n=372) and higher than the number reported for the same period in each of the last 4 years (2011-2014). From November 2015, weekly case numbers have continued to increase in a trend that is not expected for the season.A spike in cases from September 2015 was also observed in Viet Nam, whose median cases for 2010-14 followed a decreasing trend (<http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/dengue_biweekly_20160113.pdf>).Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health -- clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and secure shelter. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, and heat stress, while the direct damage costs to health (that is, excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture, water, and sanitation), is estimated to be between USD 2-4 billion/year by 2030.
