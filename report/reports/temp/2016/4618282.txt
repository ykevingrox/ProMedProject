According to Dr Htun Myint, director of the Department of Public Health in Ayeyarwady Region, 69 cases and 10 deaths of JE have been reported from 22 out of 26 townships in the region, with Mawlamyine Kyun Township most affected.Dr Myat Min Tun, deputy director of the Department of Public Health in Ayeyarwady Region, stated that only 2 cases are from the urban area, and the rest, 67 cases, are from the rural area, which has agriculture farming by irrigation.Although JE cannot transmit among persons, the virus can be passed by mosquito bites, and pigs and birds can be reservoirs. Thus, local staff are conducting mosquito control measures in the region. People with fever, and unusual events in pigs and cattle such as abortion and sudden death, should be reported to local health centers. Local people should protect themselves from mosquito bites as well.--communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[Japanese encephalitis has been active in Myanmar this year (2016).
