SciDev.Net [edited]<http://www.scidev.net/global/disease/news/raw-milk-breeds-fever-disease-east-africa.html>Consumer preferences and poor dairy processing techniques have made East Africa a hotbed for brucellosis, a fever disease spread by contaminated milk, a study warns.The disease, which is caused by Brucella bacteria shed in livestock's urine, milk and other bodily fluids, is spreading across East Africa, says an article in the latest issue of the African Crop Science Journal.Some communities in East Africa prefer raw milk to processed dairy products, the researchers point out. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that nomadic cattle farmers like the Maasai often do not use prevention methods, such as milk pasteurization and veterinary care for livestock.The disease has been largely contained in Sub-Saharan Africa. But it is still common in Kenya and Tanzania, the researchers found.The scientists screened samples from about 2300 animals and 1140 people in selected areas of Kenya and Tanzania. They found the disease in 22.7 per cent of the human samples, far above the 3-8 per cent incidence level found in previous pan-African studies.""In both countries, screening of the disease should be considered in patients who have not responded to treatments for malaria,"" as both diseases cause similar symptoms and can be hard to distinguish, the paper says.The most common species of Brucella bacteria are found in cattle and goats, says the study's lead researcher Andrew Chota, an agricultural scientist at the Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Authority, a government agency.Jo Halliday, an epidemiologist at Glasgow University in the United Kingdom, tells SciDev.Net that controlling brucellosis is important to avoid animal deaths and illness in humans, which both cause economic losses.""Vaccination of livestock has been used in many countries to greatly reduce the impacts of this disease,"" says Halliday, who has conducted studies on brucellosis in Tanzania. She adds that other control options include boiling or pasteurization of milk to prevent animal to human transmission via this route of infection.The most important way to control brucellosis, according to Chota, is to raise awareness of the disease and the economic losses it can cause to farms and families.Once that knowledge is well disseminated, he says people would see the value of control strategies like boiling milk, buying pasteurized milk and hiring trained veterinarians to help with calving and the handling of placentas and aborted foetuses.[Byline: Gilbert Nakweya]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Brucellosis is one of the diseases listed as ""WHO's 7 neglected endemic zoonoses."" It is an ancient disease with host-specific evolutionary mechanisms that allow it to hide from or manipulate cellular immunity and achieve intracellular persistence. The disease yields low fatality rates but can cause substantial disabilities. It is one of the zoonotic diseases officially addressed by the international health agencies, WHO on the human side and the OIE on the animal side. Bovine brucellosis, caprine and ovine brucellosis, and porcine brucellosis are 3 disease entities included in OIE's official list of compulsorily reportable animal diseases.The animal hosts of _B. melitensis_ are sheep, goats, cows and camels (biovars 1, 2, 3). _B. melitensis_ biovar 3 has also been found in Nile catfish and dogs. _B. abortus_ (biovars 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9) naturally infects cattle, bison, buffalo, elk, yak and camels.The animal hosts of _B. suis_ are horses (biovar 1), pigs and wild boars (biovars 1, 2, 3), the European hare (biovar 2), caribou and reindeer (biovar 4), and rodents (biovar 5). _B. suis_ biovars 1, 3, 4 have been reported to cause human disease.Humans can also be infected from marine mammals (_B. ceti_ in whales, dolphins, porpoises) and, rarely, from canines (_B. canis_).Out of the 308 postings addressing brucellosis currently available in ProMED-mail's archive, only 2 are related to Sub-Saharan Africa, though brucellosis incidence in this region is considered to be high, particularly in cattle and goats. The abstract of the paper, referenced in the above media report follows:Chota, A.C., Magwisha, H._B., Stella, _B. et al. (2016). Prevalence of Brucellosis in livestock and incidences in humans in East Africa. African Crop Science Journal 24 (1), pp 45 - 52. DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/acsj.v24i1.5S><http://www.ajol.info/index.php/acsj/article/view/133094/122721>.""Abstract:Brucellosis is an emerging zoonotic disease that poses a threat to both livestock and public health in east Africa. There are several reports of occurrence of the disease in livestock populations especially in Tanzania and Kenya, suggesting chances of increased spread to humans, and the disease being misdiagnosed for malaria. The objective of this study was to determine brucellosis prevalence in livestock and incidence in humans among pastoralists and agro-pastoralists communities in some areas of Kenya and Tanzania. A total of 2349 ruminants were screened using different serological techniques, in the selected areas. Serum samples from the Southern Highlands Zone (SHZ), Northern zone (NZ) and Eastern Zone (EZ) were screened using Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) antigen, and later positive samples were confirmed using competitive enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (c-ELISA). Results showed prevalence of 11.4 percent in the SHZ (n=799), 2.4 percent in the EZ (n=169) and 1 percent in the NZ (n= 408). Milk ring test was used to test milk samples from Migori, West Pokot and Mwingi, and the prevalences recorded in cattle were 17.9 percent (n=56) in 2012 and 11.7 (n=77) in 2014. Within the same period, West Pokot recorded prevalence of up to 21.9 percent (n=96) in cattle and 16.7 percent (n=6) in goats. Generally, Migori had lower prevalence in Kenya, but being the 3rd lower in Tanzania and Kenya with the prevalence being 4.3 percent (n=70) in goats and 2.2 percent (n=45) in goats. Serum from cattle and goats were tested using compliment fixation test (CFT); showing 0.9 percent (n=212) prevalence in Migori. In West Pokot, the prevalence was 4.0 percent (n=101) in cattle, 20 percent (n=100) in goats and 13.8 percent (=29) in sheep; whereas in Mwingi prevalence was 4.75 percent (n=43) and 9.5 percent (n=21) in cattle and goats respectively. A total of 1140 human cases were followed up in selected study areas where livestock samples were collected, and an overall incidence of 22.7 percent (n=1140) was confirmed. Selected areas in Tanzania had an incidence of 28.2 percent (n=578) and in Kenya 17.1 percent (n=562). Brucellosis is endemic in many areas of Tanzania and Kenya and pose a high risk to human health.""This paper, though confined to Kenya and Tanzania, and the current ProMED-mail posting will, hopefully, serve as a trigger to enhanced surveillance and improved reporting of this neglected zoonosis in all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>.]
