Other symptoms include low-grade fever, fatigue, muscle aches and loss of appetite. After a person is exposed, symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. Mumps can't be treated. 2 weeks ago, college health officials sent a letter to users of the school's athletic facilities cautioning them about possible infection. According to the school, the state Health Department has indicated there is minimal risk of transmission, but the school has been taking various precautions.The affected students, who have been immunized against mumps, have been isolated for the recommended period of time. 20 students who have not been immunized have been sent home until December [2016].Campus tours and general information sessions will proceed as scheduled, but residence halls home to affected students will be avoided for the time being.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Mumps is highly contagious and is characterized by fever, headache and fatigue, among other symptoms. The disease can't be treated and while the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, 2 doses of the vaccine are the best protection.

An average year in the US sees no more than several thousand cases of mumps.Swelling in the salivary glands is one of the key symptoms of mumps. Infected people also suffer fevers, aches, and muscle fatigue. The disease is highly contagious and can spread through respiratory droplets, caused by a cough or sneeze.Most people in the developed world receive the mumps vaccine as children, which has lead to the disease being nearly eradicated. However, according to the World Health Organization, the vaccine is only 85 percent effective.Harvard officials have asked students to make health and prevention a top priority. Last spring [2016], over a dozen Harvard students were quarantined to prevent the spread.Harvard is not the only school dealing with a mumps problem. Tufts university confirmed 9 cases in the past 3 weeks, and Framingham State University also had a student test positive for mumps earlier in the fall, The Boston Globe reported.[Byline: Alban Murtishi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the location of Massachusetts in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4323>. - Mod.LK]******[3] Missouri: University of MissouriDate: Thu 17 Nov 2016 15:27 GMTSource: Mail Online/Daily Mail, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]<http://dailym.ai/2grwUeo>There are another 27 probable cases of people [at the University of Missouri] who have been in close contact with someone with confirmed mumps showing symptoms for at least 2 days. The university says it's working with health officials to control the outbreak.Mumps is a viral infection that causes swelling in the salivary glands and cheeks. Anyone with symptoms is asked to stay at home.It has been on the rise nationally this year.The [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 2345 mumps cases had been reported as of last month [October 2016].That's more than twice as many as in all of 2015.Other universities also have reported cases this year [2016], including Harvard. Last week it emerged more than a dozen students have contracted mumps at the State University of New York [SUNY; see item [1] above].The outbreak [at University of Missouri], first reported last month [October 2016], started on the school's swim team. This week, 4 unrelated students were diagnosed with the debilitating infection.It is the latest in a serious of outbreaks across the country in the last few months.Dozens were diagnosed with mumps in New York City in August [2016], just weeks before more than 400 people were struck down with the virus across Arkansas.The escalating outbreak at SUNY has sparked an urgent investigation to contain the spread, with swim team practice suspended until further notice.Any students yet to get the MMR (mumps, measles, rubella) vaccination have been ordered to stay at home for 26 days. But the school insists tours for prospective students will continue as normal.The infection is incurable and can lead to devastating health concerns in adults. Sufferers have lost their hearing, become infertile, and had swollen brains. Some people do not experience any symptoms. Typically, symptoms include swollen glands, headaches, a fever, chills, fatigue, and a lack of appetite. Sufferers have described feeling pain in their stomach, neck, pelvis, and testicles.Since widespread implementation of the MMR jab, it is now barely reported. As the maps [included with this report at the source URL above] show, incidents of mumps are few and vaccinations rates are high.A mumps infection can also travel to and infect other parts of the body. When this occurs it often causes swelling and discomfort in the affected area. One of those developments is orchitis, [a swelling of one or both testicles], which affects around 25 percent of post-pubescent males. Roughly half the time it also causes the affected testicle to shrink in size. Mumps can also lead to viral meningitis, acute pancreatitis, and oophoritis (swelling of one or both ovaries). In very rare cases (around 0.1 per cent) mumps can cause encephalitis, a life-threatening inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of encephalitis include flu-like symptoms, headache, confusion, dizziness, change in personality, change in behavior, drowsiness, disorientation, seizures, and loss of consciousness.Anyone suffering these symptoms after contracting mumps should call 911 immediately. This condition requires emergency treatment in a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU).[Byline: Mia De Graaf]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[One of the 2 maps appended to this report shows how many Americans have received the MMR vaccine and the rates of mumps infection per state. The proportion immunized ranges from 81.7-99.7 percent, according to the CDC. The other map shows the mumps incidence per 100 000 people from 0 to 4.31 in 2014, as reported to the CDC. Mumps is a nationally notifiable disease, meaning that any cases must be reported to the local public health department, which in turn will report them to the CDC.A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be fund at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16851>. - Mod.LK]******[4] Maine: local colleges, CDCDate: Fri 18 Nov 2016Source: Epi-X (The Epidemic Information Exchange) [edited]Notification of potential mumps exposure at colleges in Maine -- 2016---------------------------------------------------------------------The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an outbreak of mumps associated with local colleges. Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, first identified a case with symptom onset on 27 Sep 2016 and transmission continues with new cases identified this week [week of 14 Nov 2016]. Bowdoin College identified a case with symptom onset on 31 Oct 2016 in an individual with an epi-link to Bates College. Bowdoin then identified subsequent cases.Both colleges are on Thanksgiving break starting Sat 19 Nov 2016 and exposed students may be traveling during this time.Health departments investigating possible mumps cases in persons with a link to Bates or Bowdoin College should be aware of the potential for exposure and are asked to contact Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention[Byline: Sara Robinson, Kijafa Dickinson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The link to this report is not publicly available, but ProMED-mail considers it useful to disseminate and share the information.A map showing the location of Maine in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/222>. - Mod.LK]******[5] Iowa (Dubuque County)Date: Fri 18 Nov 2016 12:52 PM CSTSource: WQAD 8, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]<http://wqad.com/2016/11/18/mumps-outbreak-in-eastern-iowa-is-worst-in-a-decade/>Health officials are puzzled by an outbreak of the mumps among Dubuque County students that has now climbed to 30 cases, which is more than 1/3 of all cases statewide.According to Dubuque County Health Department executive director Patrice Lambert, the source of the outbreak has not yet been determined. Lambert says this is the worst outbreak in 10 years in the county.Dubuque Community School District' health services coordinator, Rhonda Ramler, says officials haven't seen a pattern to the students who have been affected.The Telegraph Herald reports that precautions are being taken to try and halt the spread of the disease, which can cause fever, headaches, and swollen salivary glands.A spokesperson from the Scott County Health Department said there are currently no known cases of mumps in the Quad-Cities area [Scott County in southeastern Iowa and Henry, Mercer, and Rock Island counties in northwest Illinois; the main cities are Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa, and Rock Island and Moline in Illinois].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the location of Iowa in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29642>. An Iowa county map can be seen at <http://geology.com/county-map/iowa-county-map.gif>.Mumps cases are surging in US colleges and schools this year, 2016. It is not clear why this large increase in cases is occurring.Mumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2010, there were 2612 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66 to 95 percent) effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49 to 92 percent) effective. The MMR vaccine protects against currently circulating mumps strains. Outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated US communities, particularly in close-contact settings. In recent years, outbreaks have occurred in schools, colleges, and camps. However, high vaccination coverage helps limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks.Excerpted and edited from <http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html>. - Mod.LK]
