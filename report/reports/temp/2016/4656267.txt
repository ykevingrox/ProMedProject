International Business Times [edited]<http://www.ibtimes.com/what-leprosy-texas-reports-new-cases-biblical-disease-2016-2450516>Leprosy often evokes images of biblical times: colonies of infected patients quarantined and covered in sores [actually lepers were isolated, not quarantined; quarantine refers to separation of well people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become ill, and isolation refers to the separation of ill people who have a contagious disease from those who are healthy]. Seen as something exclusive to the past, the disease has largely faded into history, which is likely why doctors were confounded when a Texas man was recently diagnosed with it.[The patient], of Austin, visited 15 doctors and neurologists before they were able to diagnose the reason for his numbness, growing blindness and the red spots on his body. ""I was kind of floored,"" [the patient] told CBS Austin. ""He said the only thing this could be is leprosy. You're the 2nd person I've seen in my entire career in Austin.""Leprosy, or Hansen's disease, is a chronic infection caused by bacteria [_Mycobacterium leprae_]. The bacteria affect the skin and mucous membranes, causing skin lesions and growths, numbness, blindness, paralysis, and severe pain. Because the bacteria grow slowly, symptoms can appear up to 10 years after the disease is contracted. Once untreatable and stigmatized, the disease is now treatable with proper medication and disability can usually be avoided if the disease is caught early enough.[byline: Juliana Rose Pignataro]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[About 150 newly diagnosed cases of leprosy are reported in the USA each year (<http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf>). Most (70 per cent) newly diagnosed cases of leprosy in the US are believed to be ""imported"", that is, they lived or worked abroad in regions where leprosy is prevalent and where they may have acquired their disease. Only about 30 per cent of leprosy diagnoses occur in US-born people who report no foreign residence in regions where the disease is prevalent and therefore they likely acquired leprosy in the US. Most of these indigenously acquired cases reside in Texas and Louisiana, where wild _Mycobacterium leprae_-infected armadillos can be found.Serological surveys conducted on more than 5000 animals prior to 2005 confirmed that _Mycobacterium leprae_ infection was present in 9-banded armadillos in Gulf Coast states west of the Mississippi River delta (Texas, Louisiana) and in Arkansas and Mississippi (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=16248207&dopt=Abstract>). A unique genotype (3I-2-v1) was found both in the wild armadillos and US patients who resided in these areas where exposure to armadillo-borne _M. leprae_ was possible (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536>). This unique genotype had not been reported elsewhere in the world and the _M. leprae_ genotype of leprosy patients with foreign exposure was found to generally reflect their country of origin or travel history.A picture of the 9-banded armadillo can be found at <https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/images/mammals/armadillo.jpg>.The armadillos in Florida, which were previously considered leprosy-free (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=19204343&dopt=Abstract>), have recently been found to be infected with _M. leprae_ having unique genotypes. Apparently, western and eastern Gulf Coast armadillo populations have now merged (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=19204343&dopt=Abstract>) and Florida residents have been reported to be infected with these same unique armadillo genotypes. It would be interesting to know if the Texas patient reported above is infected with an armadillo genotype unique to the Western Hemisphere, or, if the Texas patient has a history of foreign exposure and the _M. leprae_ genotype reflects that history of foreign exposure.Austin, which is located in Travis County in Central Texas, with a population of 931 830 residents, is the capital of the US state of Texas (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1260>.]
