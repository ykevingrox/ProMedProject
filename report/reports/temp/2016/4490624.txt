The product of concern is Sea Port Bay Scallops (Wild Harvest, Raw Frozen) that originated in the Philippines (states ""Product of the Philippines"" on the box), distributed by Koha Oriental Foods and True World Foods. As a result, HDOH ordered this product embargoed (not to be sold, purchased, or consumed) throughout the state, and the temporary closure of all Genki Sushi restaurants on Oahu and Kauai. The scallops received by True World Foods have not been distributed to any restaurants in the state, and were embargoed at their warehouse. The scallops served at Genki locations on the Big Island and Maui originated from a different supplier and have not been associated with the outbreak.The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It continues to be challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty patients have in accurately recalling the foods consumed and locations visited during the period when infection could have taken place. Healthcare providers have been informed and are asked to notify HDOH immediately if they have a patient they suspect may be infected.HDOH encourages Hawaii residents to consider getting vaccinated for hepatitis A, and advises that they talk to their healthcare provider about hepatitis A if they are interested. Vaccination for hepatitis A is strongly recommended for certain individuals who are especially at risk (see <http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hepa.html> for a CDC list of groups recommended to be vaccinated for hepatitis A). Hawaii residents are also advised that the demand for the vaccine during the outbreak has led to varied supply levels around the state, so it is recommended that they call ahead to assure the vaccine is available at a particular clinic or pharmacy before going there.As of 14 Sep 2016, since the last update, HDOH has identified 19 new cases of hepatitis A. All cases have been in adults, 68 have required hospitalization. Findings of the investigation suggest that the source of the outbreak is focused on Oahu. As many as 10 individuals are residents of the islands of Hawaii, Kauai, or Maui, and 4 visitors have returned to the mainland. The total of confirmed cases of hepatitis A is 271, and the onset of illness has ranged from 12 Jun to 4 Sep 2016.[byline: Anthony Marangon]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Since many cases of hepatitis A are subclinical (no symptoms) or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of hepatitis A infections in this already large outbreak is likely to have been much higher.That scallops are implicated suggests that more than the adductor muscle was ingested (that is, the whole scallops, including the gastrointestinal tract) and that whatever was eaten was not cooked. If the whole scallop was not ingested, then contamination of the adductor muscle is likely to have occurred during processing from the other parts of the scallop or from a food handler or water source.The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than that of oysters, because they are active swimmers; scallops are in fact the only migratory bivalve.
