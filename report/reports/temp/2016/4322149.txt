CDC [summ., edited]<http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/candidiasis/candida-auris-alert.html>Clinical Alert to U.S. Healthcare Facilities--------------------------------------------Global Emergence of Invasive Infections Caused by the Multidrug-Resistant Yeast _Candida auris_Summary: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received reports from international healthcare facilities that _Candida auris_, an emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) yeast, is causing invasive healthcare-associated infections with high mortality. Some strains of _C. auris_ have elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to the 3 major classes of antifungals, severely limiting treatment options. _C. auris_ requires specialized methods for identification and could be misidentified as another yeast when relying on traditional biochemical methods. CDC is aware of one isolate of _C. auris_ that was detected in the United States in 2013 as part of ongoing surveillance. Experience outside the United States suggests that _C. auris_ has high potential to cause outbreaks in healthcare facilities. Given the occurrence of _C. auris_ in 9 countries [South Korea, India, South Africa, Kuwait, Colombia, Venezuela, Pakistan, U.S. and the United Kingdom] on 4 continents since 2009, CDC is alerting U.S. healthcare facilities to be on the lookout for _C. auris_ in patients.Background----------Molecular typing of strains performed by CDC suggests isolates are highly related within a country or region but highly distinct between continents. Although the causes for such emergence are unknown, they may include new or increasing antifungal selection pressures in humans, animals, or the environment._C. auris_ infections have most commonly been hospital-acquired and occurred several weeks into a patient's hospital stay. _C. auris_ has been reported to cause bloodstream infections, wound infections, and otitis. It has also been cultured from urine and the respiratory tract; however, whether isolation from these sites represented infection verses colonization in each instance is unknown. _C. auris_ has been documented to cause infections in patients of all ages. Patients were found to have similar risk factors for infections with other _Candida_ spp., including: diabetes mellitus, recent surgery, recent antibiotics, and presence of central venous catheters. Co-infection with other _Candida_ spp. and detection of _C. auris_ while the patient was being treated with antifungals have also been reported.Although no established minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints exist for _C. auris_, resistance testing of an international collection of isolates conducted by CDC demonstrated that nearly all isolates are highly resistant to fluconazole based on breakpoints established for other _Candida_ spp. More than half of _C. auris_ isolates were resistant to voriconazole, 1/3rd were resistant to amphotericin B (MIC greater than or equal to 2), and a few were resistant to echinocandins. Some isolates have demonstrated elevated MICs to all 3 major antifungal classes, including azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes, indicating that treatment options would be limited._C. auris_ phenotypically resembles _Candida haemulonii_. Commercially available biochemical-based tests, including API strips and VITEK-2, used in many U.S. laboratories to identify fungi, cannot differentiate _C. auris_ from related species. Because of these challenges, clinical laboratories have misidentified the organism as _C. haemulonii_ and _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. Some clinical laboratories do not fully identify all Candida to the species level, and _C. auris_ isolates have been reported as ""other _Candida_ spp."" Clinical, state, and public health laboratories should be aware of this organism and of the limitations in its identification.At least 2 countries have described healthcare outbreaks of _C. auris_ infection and colonization involving more than 30 patients each. Analysis of isolates from these clusters demonstrate a high degree of clonality within the same hospital, supporting the idea that the organisms are being transmitted within those healthcare facilities. The precise mode of transmission within the healthcare facility is not known. However, experience during these outbreaks suggests that _C. auris_ might contaminate the environment of rooms of colonized or infected patients. Good infection control practices and environmental cleaning may help prevent transmission.Interim Recommendations-----------------------CDC is concerned that _C. auris_ will emerge in new locations, including the United States. CDC and partners continue to work closely, and new information will be provided as it becomes available. CDC recommends the following actions for U.S. healthcare facilities and laboratories:Reporting -- Healthcare facilities who suspect they have a patient with _C. auris_ infection should contact state/local public health authorities and CDC (<candidaauris@cdc.gov>).Laboratory Diagnosis -- Diagnostic devices based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) can differentiate _C. auris_, but not all devices currently include _C. auris_ in the reference database to allow for detection. Molecular methods based on sequencing the D1-D2 region of the 28s rDNA can also identify _C. auris_. CDC requests that laboratories identifying _C. auris_ isolates in the United States notify their state or local health departments and CDC (<candidaauris@cdc.gov>). _C. haemulonii_ isolates and other isolates from clinical specimens that cannot be identified beyond _Candida_ spp. by conventional methods can be forwarded through state public health laboratories to CDC for further characterization.Infection Control -- Until further information is available, healthcare facilities should place patients with _C. auris_ colonization or infection in single rooms and healthcare personnel should use Standard and Contact Precautions. In addition, state or local health authorities and CDC should be consulted about the need for additional interventions to prevent transmission. CDC is working with domestic and international partners to develop definitive infection control guidance.Environmental Cleaning -- Anecdotal reports have suggested that _C. auris_ may persist in the environment. Healthcare facilities who have patients with _C. auris_ infection or colonization should ensure thorough daily and terminal cleaning and disinfection of these patient's rooms using an EPA-registered hospital grade disinfectant with a fungal claim.[The full article, including References, is available at the source URL.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Public Health England (PHE) has also issued an alert on 1 Jul 2016 (<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/phe-responds-to-cases-of-candida-auris-in-england>). In this report, PHE says, ""Sporadic cases of _C. auris_ have been identified throughout England since 2013 and more than 40 cases seen so far have been identified in an adult critical care unit at a hospital in England which is managing an outbreak of _C. auris_. 2 cases have also been identified from another hospital and investigations are ongoing to identify if there are any further cases."" - Mod.ML].................................................jw/ml/je/ml"
