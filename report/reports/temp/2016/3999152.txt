For HCV it is about 32. Therefore, unfortunately, we have a few years to go before we'll start seeing a significant impact of our routine immunization program on this part of the epidemic. While we do not have individual-level data related to this study, we also do not have evidence of vaccine failures.-- Tim Jones, MDState EpidemiologistTennessee Department of Health<Tim.F.Jones@tn.gov>[ProMED thanks Dr. Jones for his contribution. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.][See Also:Hepatitis B - USA: (KY, WV, TN) injection drug use 20160130.39801732015----Hepatitis B - USA: (NC) 20150613.3428825Hepatitis C - USA (03): injection drug use, 2006-2012 20150509.3350569Hepatitis C - USA (02): (CA) iatrogenic 20150501.3333701Hepatitis C - USA: (MA) drug users 20150417.3302443Hepatitis C, HIV - USA: (IN) 20150330.3265081Hepatitis C & B - USA: (OH) 20150201.31344532013----Hepatitis B - USA (02): (WV) comment 20131008.1990722Hepatitis B - USA: (WV) acute cases increase 20131007.1988954Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (04): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130607.1760955Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (OK), possible dental exposure, alert 20130329.1609886].................................................ll/pg/jw"
