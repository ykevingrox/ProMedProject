Daily News & Analysis (DNA) [edited]<http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-records-spike-in-leprosy-cases-2263669>In 2005, India had proudly declared itself free from leprosy. Yet, current figures show that this is far from the truth. According to figures accessed by DNA by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) cases of the dreaded diseases have been increasing year by year.In 2015-16, India recorded 127 326 cases of leprosy, an increase of 1.22 per cent from last year [2014-15] when 125 785 cases of leprosy were detected. In fact since 2005 cases of grade II or permanent disabilities due to leprosy have constantly been rising over the past decade. In 2007-08, 3477 cases of disability were recorded. This has now risen to 5857 cases in 2015-16 -- an alarming 68 per cent. ""The rise in cases of disability is a bad sign. This disability occurs when an active case of leprosy infection goes unreported for a long time and is untreated for over two years of active infection,"" said Dr Anil Kumar, deputy director general (Leprosy), MoHFW.Leprosy is an airborne infection, which attacks persons with low immunity. It may lead to permanent disability if not detected and treated in time. Doctors say that a case of leprosy will start showing signs of disability like loss of fingers and toes in 2 years since the setting in of the infection. If symptoms like discolouration, oily patches or nodules on the skin are reported early, disability can be avoided by starting timely treatment.The spike in cases has raised alarm bells in the Indian government. Even as leprosy stood eliminated from India, which means less than one case was recorded in a population of 10 000 or one lakh, the MoHFW is now launching a massive screening campaign to pick up cases of infection in 19 high risk states.Starting [5 Sep 2016], the MoHFW launched a campaign to screen 32 crore [320 million] persons in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Nagaland, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Delhi, and Lakshadweep.For a country as diverse and populous as India, elimination of leprosy at 'national' level can be misleading. In the recent most mass screening, MoHFW notes that it intends to cover all districts in high-burden states that have a prevalence rate of more than one leprosy case in a population of 10 000 in the past 3 years. Health officials admit that certain pockets in such districts record a prevalence of as high as 8 cases of leprosy in a population of 10 000.'Elimination' means recording less than one case of prevalence of a disease in a population of 10 000. On the other hand, 'eradication', means reducing the incidence of the disease to zero and not recording any more cases of that disease. According to available data, 3 in every 10 000 persons in Chhattisgarh are actively infected with leprosy, while in Odisha 2 in every 10 000 persons are infected. In Delhi, Chandigarh and Gujarat, the prevalence is more than 1 case in a population of 10 000.[byline: Maitri Porecha]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although India achieved nationally what WHO refers to as ""the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem"" (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in December 2005 (<http://209.61.208.233/en/Section10/Section20_16172.htm>), leprosy has not been eradicated in India. In 2015 India contributed 60.4 per cent of new cases of leprosy detected worldwide (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/249601/1/WER9135.pdf>).In 2015, 51.3 per cent of new cases in India had multibacillary [infectious] leprosy, which is an indication of the proportion of new cases with contagious disease in the community; 8.9 per cent of new cases occurred in children, which is an indication of ongoing disease transmission; and 4.2 per cent of new cases of leprosy had chronic deformities and disability, which reflects problems in case finding (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/249601/1/WER9135.pdf>).For a discussion of the problems of leprosy control in India, see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail posts Leprosy - India (03): (GJ) increased incidence, comment 20131006.1986913, Leprosy - India (02): (GJ) increased incidence 20131005.1984154, and Leprosy - India (05): (MH) comment 20120704.1189849. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.]
