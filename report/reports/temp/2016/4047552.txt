Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-britain-nurse-idUSKCN0VW0W2>According to officials speaking on Tuesday [23 Feb 2016], Scottish nurse who recovered from Ebola virus disease (EVD) but then suffered life-threatening complications from it persisting in her brain, has been admitted to hospital for a 3rd time. She is stated to be in stable condition.She contracted EVD in December 2014 when she was working in a treatment facility in Sierra Leone at the height of an EVD epidemic which involved the 3 countries in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone). She was being transferred on Tuesday [23 Feb 2016] from the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow [Scotland] to the Royal Free Hospital in London [England], which has a unit especially set up to address any EVD cases in Britain.According to a hospital statement, ""We can confirm that she is being transferred to the Royal Free Hospital due to a late complication from her previous infection by the Ebola virus. She will now be treated by the hospital's infectious diseases team under nationally agreed guidelines.""After being transferred from Sierra Leone to Britain, she initially recovered from the Ebola hemorrhagic fever and was sent home in January 2015. However, in October [2015] she again became ill and doctors found the virus was persisting in tissues in her brain. They later said she had developed meningitis caused by the Ebola virus -- the 1st known such case.An experimental antiviral drug, GS5734, was administered. Doctors did not indicate whether they thought the antiviral had improved her condition. She was last discharged from Royal Free in November 2015. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is very sad news. This poor nurse has suffered more than anyone deserves. One has to wonder whether her situation is unique or whether, more likely, this is occurring in West Africa, but either not recognized or reported. From the report below and previous publication, one suspects other survivors are experiencing serious medical complications following ""recovery"" from acute Ebola virus disease. - Mod.LK]******[2] UK: British nurse Ebola virus persistenceDate: Tue 23 Feb 2016Source: Independent [edited]<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/pauline-cafferkey-as-ebola-nurse-returns-to-hospital-scientists-fears-about-virus-living-on-in-a6891346.html>As 'Ebola nurse' returns to hospital, scientists' fears about virus living on in tissue are confirmed--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to experts, the Ebola virus can stay buried in hard-to-reach areas of survivors' tissue, and its effects could continue long after people have apparently recovered. This does not mean people can contract the Ebola virus disease (EVD) twice, and the risk of transmission to others is low. However, there is a risk that further outbreaks can be triggered.Scientists are still not entirely sure about what the long-term effects of Ebola are.
