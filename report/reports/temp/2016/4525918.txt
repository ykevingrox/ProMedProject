French _Aedes albopictus_ are able to transmit yellow fever virus. [Abstract]We assessed the ability of a French population of _Aedes albopictus_ to transmit yellow fever virus (YFV). Batches of 30-40 female mosquitoes were analysed at 7, 14 and 21 days post-exposure (dpe). Bodies, heads and saliva were screened for YFV. Infectious viral particles were detected in bodies and heads at 7, 14 and 21 dpe whereas the virus was found in saliva only from 14 dpe. Our results showed that _Ae. albopictus_ can potentially transmit YFV.[Conclusion]We assessed the vector competence of _Aedes albopictus_ collected in France for a West African strain of yellow fever virus (YFV). Our results show that this temperate population of _Ae. albopictus_ was able to deliver virus through saliva 14 days after receiving an infectious blood-meal.DiscussionThe establishment of a local YF transmission cycle outside endemic areas is related to competent _Aedes_ mosquitoes, active all year long in tropical regions and during the warm period in temperate areas. The mosquito species _Ae. albopictus_ is present in 20 European countries, and a strain of this species (Houston) in the United States has been previously reported to be a competent vector for YFV. Hence travellers returning to Europe from countries where a YF outbreak is occurring could be a source of infection for local strains of _Ae. albopictus_. We therefore assessed the competence of _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes from the south of France for a West African strain of YFV.The virus was detected at 14 dpe in saliva of the French _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes at a rate of 2 mosquitoes in 40, a relatively low transmission efficiency. While this is reassuring, a low vector competence can on the other hand contribute to select for virulent virus strains capable of eliciting high viraemia in humans and causing more severe clinical symptoms. Moreover although our results point to a low transmission rate (2/9) for YFV, the anthropophilic nature of _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes and their high densities in urban areas may allow them to be a vector of YFV.Concerning the virus strain assessed in this study, the West African YFV strain should not be very genetically distant from the other 6 genotypes with about Ûä9 percent amino-acid divergence between strains, indicating genetic stability of YFV genotypes. However, small genetic changes in the viral genome may change the vector competence.As Europe has faced YF outbreaks in the past, the last being recorded in Gibraltar in 1905, a risk of importation of YF into Europe is to be considered. Although so far there have been hardly any reports from Europe of imported YF cases, many imported cases of chikungunya and dengue [virus infections], 2 other arboviral diseases, have been documented. If YF follows the same path as dengue and chikungunya, which have a greater number of imported cases, a local transmission of YF [virus] in temperate regions where _Ae. albopictus_ is established becomes a plausible scenario, underlining the need for continued vigilance for YF.--Communicated by: ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[One of the recent concerns about the large outbreak of YF in Angola was the risk of YF virus infected people going to localities where _Aedes albopictus_ was abundant. The above findings, along with those of CDC scientists in the USA, indicate that this concern was valid. In the recent past, 11 YF viremic individuals did go from Angola to China -- fortunately at a time when vector mosquitoes were not active. The above report does provide a bit of reassurance in that vector efficiency and transmission rates were low. This, coupled with the fact that _Ae. albopictus_ is not as strict a human biter as is _Ae. aegypti_, which further reduces the risk that a YF outbreak might be initiated in southern France or other temperate zone localities where this mosquito is found. But the risk is not zero, and surveillance is prudent. _Ae. albopictus_ has been found in temperate areas across the southern 1/3 to 1/2 of the USA and recently in California, in Queensland state in Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of France can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>. - Mod.TY]
