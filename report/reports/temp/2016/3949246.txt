All Africa [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201601180853.html>The sharp rise in malaria cases is exerting pressure on Rwanda's blood bank, raising fears that, should the infections continue at the current rate, hospitals across the country will be short of blood. This is because untimely treatment and prolonged sickness due to resistance to anti-malarial drugs, coupled with pre-existence of other health complications, make patients more likely to need blood transfusions.Rwanda Today has learnt that health facilities in malaria-prone districts -- namely Kirehe, Nyagatare, Bugesera and Nyanza -- are experiencing the growing blood demand the most.Government officials have, however, not directly linked the situation to the reported increase in cases of malaria, a disease that had been declared wiped out in Rwanda but has resurfaced.""There are some hospitals that have been registering more than 50 malaria cases in a day; of course not all the patients needed blood, but those admitted in critical condition obviously have to be given a blood transfusion,"" Dr Swaibu Gatare, head of National Centre for Blood Transfusion (NCBT), told journalists in Kigali on Thursday [14 Jan 2016].Rwanda was recently hit by a sharp rise in malaria infections years after the disease had been under control. Health facilities across the country documented numerous malaria cases towards the end of last year [2015] with many patients getting admitted, triggering a shortage of malaria drugs. The Ministry of Health blamed the re-emergence of the disease partly on climate change, while officials also hinted at a possible laxity by the institutions in charge of malaria control programmes.The sudden countrywide surge in malaria infections, coupled with a reduced turnout of blood donors during the festive days, threatened to empty the country's blood bank, officials said, despite it having seen increased stocks in the past 2 years.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the WHO World Malaria Report 2015 (<www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/report/en/>), Rwanda reported 1 610 812 malaria cases in 2013, and there is a risk of infection in the entire country.The present surge could indicate shortcomings in the national control program. Again, according to the WHO World Malaria Report 2015, the government is not covering any expenses, and the control program was entirely financed by the Global Fund for HIV, TB and Malaria in 2009, the last year for which information is available. Indeed, slide positivity and rapid test positivity rates have been increasing since 2012, indicating that the present surge has been under way for some years. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/173>.].................................................sb/ep/msp/sh"
