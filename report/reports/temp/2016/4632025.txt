WHO Surveillance and monitoring, influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update - 276 (based on data up to 30 Oct 2016)--------------------------------------------------------Summary - Influenza activity in temperate southern hemisphere countries is back at inter-seasonal levels. Influenza activity in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere has not yet picked up and remained at inter-seasonal levels.- In temperate South America, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity continue to decrease throughout the sub-region.- In South Africa and Oceania, influenza virus activity is now at inter-seasonal levels.- In African countries, few reported surveillance activity in this period. Senegal and Kenya reported influenza A virus detections, and CÌ«te d'Ivoire reported influenza B virus detections.- In the Caribbean countries, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low except in Cuba where influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses continue to be detected.- In Central America, influenza virus activity remained low but RSV continued to circulate in several countries as the predominant respiratory virus.- In tropical South America, respiratory virus activities remained low with exception of French Guyana where influenza A(H3N2) viruses detections increased slightly.- In tropical countries of South Asia, influenza activity was low.- In South East Asia, a decreasing trend in influenza detection was observed, although influenza activity continued to be reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Cambodia. Influenza activity also increased in southern China, with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating.- In Western Asia influenza detections remained low.- In North America and Europe, influenza activity was low with few influenza virus detections and ILI levels below seasonal thresholds. In the United States, RSV activity continued to be reported.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 85 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 17 Oct 2016 to 30 Oct 2016 (data as of 11 Nov 2016 04:49:00 UTC).The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 65 111 specimens during that time period. A total  of 2215 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1866 (84.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 349 (15.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 73 (5.3 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1306 (94.7 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 15 (30 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 35 (70 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Overall, the influenza circulation continues at inter-seasonal levels in most countries and Influenza A/H3N2 subtype predominating, some respiratory syncytial virus detections. No novel Influenza subtypes reported in this update. - Mod.UBA]
