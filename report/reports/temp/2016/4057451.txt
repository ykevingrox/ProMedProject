Reported to be a secondary case -- a household contact of a previously confirmed case.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[With the inclusion of the 4 newly confirmed cases mentioned above, since 1 Jan 2016 there have been a total of 27 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Saudi Arabia. It appears as though transmission of the MERS-CoV has picked up in February 2016. There were a total of 7 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported during the month of January 2016, as compared with 20 cases reported in February 2016, 16 of whom were reported in the past 2 weeks (since 16 Feb 2016). Interestingly, 20 (74.1 percent) were reported to be primary infections, 16 of whom had a history of direct or indirect contact with camels. Of note is the apparent household cluster of cases reported from Riyadh over the past several days. One suspects the index case in this cluster was the 24-year-old expat male from Riyadh, reported as a newly confirmed case on 17 Feb 2016.A map showing the locations of these newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL. On this map, one can see that all 4 cases come from Riyadh province. Alartawia (Al Artawiyah) is a Bedouin camp on the road between Riyadh and Kuwait, and Shagraa (Shaqra) is northwest of the capital city of Riyadh.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
