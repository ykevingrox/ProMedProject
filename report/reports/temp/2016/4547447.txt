The Express Tribune [edited]<http://tribune.com.pk/story/1195906/another-polio-case-detected-sujawal/>An 8-year-old became the latest victim of the polio virus in a coastal village of Sujawal district, making it the 5th case of the crippling virus in the province this year (2016). [AP], son of [ARP], is a native of a village in Khothi union council in Jati taluka (Sindh province). Coordinator of the Emergency Operation Centre for Polio Fayaz Jatoi told The Express Tribune, ""The child was given 3 doses of polio vaccine [at different times]. Unfortunately, he couldn't develop immunity.""Following the detection, Jatoi, Hyderabad Commissioner Qazi Shahi Pervez and other officials, along with a World Health Organisation team, visited Sujawal on Saturday [8 Oct 2016]. Jatoi said that they still have to identify the origin of the virus. He suggested that weak immunity or ineffective immunisation may be the cause.[Byline: Z Ali]--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs from HealthMap Alerts<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[According to the news report above, a new polio case has been reported from the southern Sindh province of Pakistan. The total number of cases confirmed in Pakistan during 2016 is 15 with 5 of them reported from Sindh province. Pakistan has seen very significant progress towards polio eradication during 2016 with remarkable reduction of number of cases compared to previous years; however, sustained efforts are required to render Pakistan polio free. The updated polio situation is available at <http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces>. - Mod.MS][While the virus type involved in this polio case -- WPV (wild poliovirus) vs. cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) is not specified, according to the End Polio Pakistan initiative website, this case is being counted as a WPV associated case (see <http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces> for data), making it the 15th case of WPV associated disease reported in Pakistan during 2016.According to another media report on this incident, the age of the case is listed as 8 months old, and the prior history of vaccination included 2 doses of vaccine (see <http://dailytimes.com.pk/pakistan/09-Oct-16/govt-calls-emergency-meeting-as-5th-polio-victim-surfaces-in-sindh>).We await the results of genetic testing of the poliovirus involved in this case to better understand the origin of the virus involved.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Sindh, Pakistan can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/707>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Nigeria (Borno), WPV and cVDPV - WHO updateDate: Thu 6 Oct 2016Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease outbreak news (DON) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/06-october-2016-polio-nigeria/en/>Wild polio and vaccine derived polio in Nigeria-----------------------------------------------Wild polio virus (WPV1) outbreakAfter more than 2 years without the detection of wild polio in Nigeria, the Government reported 3 laboratory confirmed wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) cases with onset between July and August 2016.All 3 cases were detected from Borno State, in children between 2 and 5 years of age. Two of them developed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) while one was asymptomatic, identified as a close contact of a child with AFP.The detected viruses are closely linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011. This is an indication that this virus strain has been circulating without detection since that time.Vaccine derived polio casesIn addition to the wild polio cases reported, a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has also been detected in specimens collected from a healthy household contact of one of the WPV1 cases recently reported as part of strengthened disease surveillance activities being implemented in the area.The genetic analysis of the isolated strain indicates that also this cVDPV2 strain has been circulating in the area for at least 2 years without prior detection.Public Health ResponseA regional outbreak response in north-eastern Nigeria continues to be implemented, in response to the detected wild and vaccine derived polio virus.Large-scale supplementary immunization activities are currently being implemented. In response to detection of polio in Borno, the government of Nigeria has declared the outbreak to be a national public health emergency; and the neighbouring governments of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad and Niger declared a regional public health emergency for the Lake Chad sub-region.Regional outbreak response is being coordinated across all countries, and within the context of the broader humanitarian emergency affecting parts of the region. Polio eradication teams on the ground, at national, regional and global levels, are closely coordinating with humanitarian emergency response teams, other United Nation organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations, to maximise the impact of all available resources and ensure that polio vaccine can be delivered alongside broader health interventions to the most vulnerable and at-need populations in the region. Surveillance activities are strengthened across the region.WHO Risk AssessmentThe detection of wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) and vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of poliovirus circulation.A robust outbreak response as initiated is needed to rapidly stop this event and ensure sufficient substantial vaccination coverage across the country to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.Insecurity and inaccessibility in some areas of the country continues to pose a challenge to the response operations.WHO assesses the risk of international spread of the WPV1 and cVDPV2 strains circulating in the area to be high, in particular to neighbouring areas of the Lake Chad sub-region.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The 3 WPV associated cases of polio in Borno Nigeria have been covered in prior ProMED-mail posts (see prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below). The isolation of a cVDPV from a contact of one of the WPV1 cases in Borno represents the 1st cVDPV isolated from an individual in Nigeria during 2016 (there has been a cVDPV isolated from environmental samples earlier this year -- see Poliomyelitis update (07): Nigeria cVDPV environmental sample, EpiCore responses 20160513.4220460 and Poliomyelitis update (06): Nigeria cVDPV environmental sample, global, RFI 20160512.4217800).Clearly, parts of Borno state have suffered from inadequate vaccination activities during the previous 2 years since the increase in civil unrest in the area.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Borno state, Nigeria can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/621>. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Global update - polio eradication initiativeDate: Thu 6 Oct 2016Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Polio eradication this week (as of 4 Oct 2016):Wild poliovirus type 1 and Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases:Total cases: YTD*-2016: WPV** / cVDPV*** // YTD*-2015: WPV** / cVDPV*** // Total in 2015: WPV** / cVDPV***Globally: 26 / 3 // 48 / 15 // 74 / 32- in endemic countries: 26 / 0 // 48 / 3 // 74 / 3- in non-endemic countries: 0 / 3 // 0 / 12 // 0 / 29* YTD - year to date** WPV - wild poliovirus*** cVDPV - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirusCase breakdown by country:Countries: YTD-2016: WPV / cVDPV // YTD-2015: WPV / cVDPV // Total 2015: WPV / cVDPV // Onset paralysis most recent case: WPV / CVDPVAfghanistan: 9 / 0 // 12 / 0 // 20 / 0 // 10 Aug 2016 / NAGuinea: 0 / 0 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 7 // NA / 13 Dec 2015Lao PDR: 0 / 3 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 8 // NA / 10 Jan 2016Madagascar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 9 // 0 / 10 // NA / 21 Aug 2015Myanmar: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 4 Oct 2015Nigeria: 3 / 0 // 0 / 1 // 0 / 1 // 5 Aug 2016 / 15 May 2015Pakistan: 14 / 0 // 36 / 2 // 54 / 2 // 26 Jul 2016 / 8 Feb 2015Ukraine: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // NA / 6 Jul 2015NA: onset of paralysis in most recent case is prior to 2015.Figures exclude non-AFP sources.Madagascar, Ukraine and Lao PDR cVDPV1, all others cVDPV2.cVDPV definition: see document ""Reporting and classification of vaccine-derived polioviruses"" at <http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VDPV_ReportingClassification.pdf>.Weekly country updates as of [28 Sep 2016]------------------------------------------Afghanistan- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 9. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2016] in Paktika province, close to the border with Pakistan.- No WPV1 environmental positive samples have been reported in 2016. The most recent samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] -- one in Jalalabad district of Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.- Immunization campaigns are currently ongoing.Pakistan- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 14. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [27 Jul 2016], in South Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).- Two new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Pichin, Balochistan (collected on [3 Sep 2016]) and Jacobabad, Sindh (collected on [16 Aug 2016]). Of note: Pichin began environmental surveillance in August [2016]; since then, 3 of the 4 collected samples tested positive for WPV1 (results from the 4th sample are pending).- Continued detection of positive environmental samples throughout 2016 confirms that virus transmission continues to be geographically widespread across the country, despite strong improvements being achieved.- Efforts continue to further strengthen immunization and surveillance activities in all provinces of the country.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3 in 2016 and 8 in 2015.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.Madagascar- More than one year has passed since the most recent circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type one (cVDPV1) case, which had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015], from Sud-Ouest region. No cases of cVDPV1 have been reported in 2016. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 is 10.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for [9-11 Nov 2016] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV).Myanmar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case was isolated from a 16-month old child in Maungdaw district of Rakhine state, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 is 2.Nigeria- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 3. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [6 Aug 2016], from Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno state.- A regional outbreak response in north-eastern Nigeria continues to be implemented, both in response to the WPV1 cases detected in August [2016] and to the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates, detected in Borno from an environmental sample (collected in March [2016]) and a healthy contact of one of the WPV1 cases (from August [2016]).- The emergency regional outbreak response is being implemented under the guidance of the Polio Eradication Emergency Operations Center (EOC), led by the Government of Nigeria and with support from WHO and GPEI partners. The outbreak response is being coordinated with neighbouring countries and in the broader humanitarian emergency response context affecting the region. Similar approaches to outbreak response were successfully implemented in previous years in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.Lake Chad sub-region- The recent detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Borno state, Nigeria, poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad sub-region and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Health leaders at last month's [September 2016] Regional Committee for Africa declared the situation to be a regional public health emergency for the Lake Chad sub-region.- A regional outbreak response is currently ongoing, to reach more than 10 million children across Central African Republic, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon. The activity is being coordinated and planned across all countries, with particular focus on sharing of data and population movements. Some areas are currently inaccessible due to a combination of insecurity and flooding in the rainy seasonWest Africa- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is 7.- While progress in Guinea continues to be achieved, gaps remain sub-nationally both in population immunity and surveillance sensitivity. Undetected circulation cannot be ruled out. Efforts are continuing to rapidly fill these gaps and ensure the outbreak has been fully stopped.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are being conducted this week in Liberia [week of 3 Oct 2016], Sierra Leone and Guinea, to be followed by additional NIDs at the end of the month [October 2016]. Liberia and Sierra Leone are considered at particular risk of polio re-infection or emergence, including by potential spread of cVDPV from Guinea or WPV from Nigeria. Significant subnational immunity and surveillance gaps remain, following a decline in health systems capacity as a result of the Ebola outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The above global update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative website has some noticeable points. The 1st is that Nigeria has been returned to the list of countries where WPV is considered endemic as a result of the identification of the 3 WPV1 cases that genetic studies confirmed were most likely silently circulating since 2011. The 2nd observation is that the specified dates of last poliovirus associated disease onset for many of the countries differed by one calendar day than reported on previous reports -- a minor change, but one our observant readers will definitely notice and should be pointed out.The good news is the continued slow increase in numbers of cases of WPV associated disease confirmed during 2016 amounting to slightly more than half of the cases reported during the same time frame in 2015. Even more so, the marked decrease in the number of cases of polio attributable to cVDPVs -- currently 1/5th of that reported during the same time frame in 2015.Are we approaching the end game? Time will tell.An interactive map showing locations of WPV, cVDPV and environmental sampling identified polioviruses (and where sampling is performed) can be found at: <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>. - Mod.MPP]
