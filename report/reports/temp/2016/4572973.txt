India Today, Press Trust of India (PTI) report [edited]<http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/hundreds-of-school-children-hit-by-food-poisoning-in-china/1/790532.html>More than 300 school children have been hospitalized since yesterday  afternoon, 18 Oct 2016, but none face life-threatening illness, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.According to doctors, patient blood test reports showed high white blood cell levels, indicating infection. Experts said the discovery confirmed that the students were suffering from gastrointestinal diseases caused by shigellosis. ""_Shigella sonnei_ bacteria can breed in food and water at a suboptimum temperature, which can easily cause bacillary dysentery,"" they said, adding severe cases of shigellosis can be so serious that patients, particularly young children and the elderly, need to be hospitalized.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The exact location of the outbreak in northern China is not stated in the post.Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
