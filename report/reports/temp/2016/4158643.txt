The Tribune [edited]<http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/16-chicken-pox-cases-stir-health-dept-into-action/221651.html>Panic gripped residents of the Mundian Khurd area [Ludhiana district, Punjab state], under Sanhewal block, after 16 persons were reported to be suffering from chickenpox. Of them, 11 are children in the age group of 4-14 years. During a routine visit, a health worker of the department came across children having pimples and rashes. He informed the senior medical officer [SMO] of the community health centre, Sanhewal. The SMO, Dr JP Singh, after gathering more information, came to know that 3 cases of chickenpox were also reported from the OPD of the centre. The information was passed on to the District Epidemiologist, Dr Ramesh, who reached the area with a rapid response team. The team visited 250 houses in the area and a total of 16 patients were found to be suffering from chickenpox. A camp was organised by the department and the local people were sensitised on chickenpox. Dr Ramesh said most people were taking home remedies and they were made aware regarding steps to be taken for early recovery of patients. They were also advised to isolate the patients to prevent its spread. The department will also be holding a camp tomorrow [14 Apr 2016]. Meanwhile, cases of chickenpox have scared mothers who have stopped sending their wards for playing outside and to schools as a precautionary measure. A resident of the area said: ""I will not send my son to school for the remaining week, so he does not catch infection."" Another mother said a little boy in her neighborhood is suffering from chickenpox and his mother does not prevent him from playing with other children. ""I have asked my daughter not to play with him till he gets well, as chickenpox is an infectious disease and she might catch it as well,"" she said. How does one contract chickenpox? Chickenpox is caused by the herpes varicella-zoster virus. It is spread by droplets from sneeze or cough, or by contact with the clothing and bed linens used by an infected person. The onset of symptoms is 10 to 21 days after exposure. When can chickenpox vaccine be given? The varicella vaccine is given when children are between 12 and 15 months old. They receive a booster shot for further protection at 4 to 6 years of age. Children who are older than 6 but younger than 13, and who have not had chickenpox also may receive the vaccine, with the 2 doses given at least 3 months apart. [Byline: Manav Mander]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Chickenpox [varicella] is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the _Varicella-zoster virus_ (VZV). Following infection with VZV, the patients develop a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox may be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. The virus is transmitted easily from infected people to others who have no previous history of chickenpox or have not received the chickenpox vaccine. VZV spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters (<http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/overview.html>). Chickenpox outbreaks generally are reported from schools or day care centers and the best precaution is early isolation i.e. confinement at home of the cases from contact with other healthy children as also mentioned in the above report. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1789>.]
