The number of cases might be more than that reported and diagnosed, if all the doctors in other areas who suspected H1N1 in their patients sent their samples. At this time, only a few hospitals are reporting cases, thus this is really the tip of the iceberg.  The situation may be much worse than it appears. The government needs to sensitize physicians to detect cases and treat them in time to prevent mortality and morbidity.

An informative source on H1N1 can be found at <http://www.flu.gov/about_the_flu/h1n1/>. The disease is preventable, as the virus is included in the human vaccine.The symptoms of swine flu include sore throat, a headache, overall body pain, a runny nose, coughing and difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea and a high fever. Patients with exacerbating co-morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal insufficiency and cancer are among those most at risk of contracting severe influenza H1N1. It is recommended that such patients take the influenza vaccine as a protective measure and for anyone in contact with them to frequently wash their hands and use face masks to avoid the spread of infection.ProMED thanks the contributor for submitting this update on H1N1 in Pakistan. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.]
