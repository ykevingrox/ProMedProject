As a result, the health district is asking people who visited the resort near Latham in July 2016 to contact its offices for an interview, even if they did not experience illness. In a news release, the district said some people reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever, but that ""the origin of these symptoms is unclear, and nothing is confirmed.""Long's Retreat is working with the health district and the Ohio Department of Health to determine the cause of the illness. Officials there are exploring all areas, including water sources leading into the lake at Long's Retreat, the lake itself, possible food sources and concessions, restaurants, and camping sites.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The symptoms described could well be norovirus. If it were, it is interesting to note that the prototype agent, the Norwalk virus, was 1st isolated in Norwalk, Ohio. Having an epidemic curve, the number of cases becoming ill per day can assist in deciding if this is a point source outbreak or one with a persistent source. Agents that readily transmit from person to person, causing secondary cases, however, can make the outbreak curve harder to interpret. The length of illness can help in the differential diagnosis but specific cultures or antigen tests will be diagnostic. Remember, in the case of sewage-contaminated drinking water or recreational water, there can be multiple agents occurring in the population. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35125>.]
