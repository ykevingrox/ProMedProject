La OpiniÌ n [in Spanish, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.laopinion.com.co/region/alerta-en-norte-de-santander-por-brote-de-leishmaniasis-110877#ATHS>According to a report by the director of the Departmental Health Institute (IDS), Juan Bitar, an outbreak of leishmaniasis [cutaneous] that has left more than 80 affected in the department [Norte de Santander] has the authorities in a state of alert. According to the official, the outbreak began in Arboledas, then moved to ChinÌÁcota, Bochalema, TibÌ¼, Cucutilla, Toledo, Labateca, and other towns in the region.While the Institute and the health network have the ability to address this epidemiological event, currently there is an additional technical sanitation team in charge of strengthening work with communities exposed to the vector. ""We are working with the vector and sanitation technicians to manage this condition, which has always been with us in this department,"" said Bitar. He said that outbreaks occur most frequently in coffee-growing areas, which are currently being harvested. ""It can occur because as you are harvesting the coffee, the _Lutzomyia_ (transmitter vector) comes out in the coffee plantations,"" he said. ""The farmer is careful in coffee plantations, but not at home.""Therefore, the Health Institute seeks support for obtaining repellents and has spoken with the mayors, in order to have municipal support in treating the houses (with insecticides).Initially there was a favorable response from the mayor of Arboledas, one of the hardest hit areas, which in April [2016] has registered (a case) almost daily and so far this year has reported 75 patients in the localities of CiÌ±era, VolcÌÁn, Guacamayas, ChicaguÌÁ alto, Villasucre, and San Pablo.Jenifer Laguado, public health coordinator in Arboledas, said the increase in cases of the disease in this town is surprising and the reasons for it unknown. In 2013 only one case was reported, but today it has the highest incidence of cases in the country. ""In 2014 we had 60 cases; in 2015, 164, and this year [2016] cases are increasing,"" she said.Infected dogs that have become vectors have been found in the area and they have had to be euthanized because there is no treatment. To date, more than 10 infected pets in 6 localities have been euthanized. In addition, there have been fumigation activities, prevention campaigns, and distribution of special bed-nets to mitigate the spread of the disease.According to data from IDS, leishmaniasis outbreaks have continued in 2015 and 2016, and so far there are 189 patients in Arboledas; 61 in ChinÌÁcota; 41 in Cucutilla, 39 in CÌÁchira, and 36 in Bochalema, the most affected municipalities.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Colombia, with the highest number of _Leishmania_ species affecting humans in the world (7 species in total). Around 90.3 percent of all cases are CL (cutaneous leishmaniasis), 0.4 percent are MCL (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis), and 0.3 percent are VL (visceral leishmaniasis) [2]. The disease predominates in a large part of the country, especially in sylvatic foci, and in the inter-Andean valleys, where working in coffee plantations can be seen as a risk factor (Alexander B, et al: Relationship between coffee cultivation practices in Colombia and exposure to infection with _Leishmania_. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 2009; 103(12): 1263-8; <http://trstmh.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/12/1263.long>). Epidemic outbreaks of CL caused by _L. braziliensis_, _L. guyanensis_, and _L. panamensis_ have been reported.

It seems that this focus in the Eastern part of Colombia close to Venezuela is a new one. - Mod.EPMapsColombia <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/southamerica/map-of-Colmbia.gif> and Norte de Santander, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40661   - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
