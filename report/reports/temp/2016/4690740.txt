Contained by that November [2014], the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo killed dozens of people, while the crisis in West Africa killed more than 11 000 during the 2 years before it was contained. The 2nd outbreak had followed the course that 7 earlier Ebola epidemics had taken, with from 100 to 200 cases, with transmissions outside their original areas rare, with perhaps 5 to 10 organizations responding, and lasting from 2 to 4 months. -more...]Research---------6 Dec 2016: Researchers find how Ebola disables the immune system<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-12-ebola-disables-immune.html>[A new study at The University of Texas Medical Branch [UTMB] in Galveston sheds light on how Ebola so effectively disables the human immune system.Virologist Alex Bukreyev, UTMB professor and senior author of the study, said the research team engineered versions of the Ebola virus in order to study how the components responsible for thwarting or disabling our immune defenses wreak their havoc.

Blair RA, Morse BS, Tsai LL. (14 Nov 2016, Epub ahead of print). Public health and public trust: Survey evidence from the Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in Liberia. Soc Sci Med. 2016 Nov 14;172:89-97. doi: 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.11.016.Abstract.Trust in government has long been viewed as an important determinant of citizens' compliance with public health policies, especially in times of crisis. Yet evidence on this relationship remains scarce, particularly in the developing world. We use results from a representative survey conducted during the 2014-15 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in Monrovia, Liberia to assess the relationship between trust in government and compliance with EVD control interventions. We find that respondents who expressed low trust in government were much less likely to take precautions against EVD in their homes, or to abide by government-mandated social distancing mechanisms designed to contain the spread of the virus. They were also much less likely to support potentially contentious control policies, such as ""safe burial"" of EVD-infected bodies. Contrary to stereotypes, we find no evidence that respondents who distrusted government were any more or less likely to understand EVD's symptoms and transmission pathways. While only correlational, these results suggest that respondents who refused to comply may have done so not because they failed to understand how EVD is transmitted, but rather because they did not trust the capacity or integrity of government institutions to recommend precautions and implement policies to slow EVD's spread. We also find that respondents who experienced hardships during the epidemic expressed less trust in government than those who did not, suggesting the possibility of a vicious cycle between distrust, non-compliance, hardships and further distrust. Finally, we find that respondents who trusted international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) were no more or less likely to support or comply with EVD control policies, suggesting that while INGOs can contribute in indispensable ways to crisis response, they cannot substitute for government institutions in the eyes of citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future public health crises.] Control of emerging Ebola infections could be aided by new monitoring method<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-12-emerging-ebola-infections-aided-method.html>[Citation. Backer JA, Wallinga J (2016) Spatiotemporal Analysis of the 2014 Ebola Epidemic in West Africa. PLoS Comput Biol 12(12): e1005210. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005210. New research on the 2014 Ebola epidemic tracks the rate at which infections move from one district to another and how often infections cross the borders between countries. This study could be used to analyze breakouts of new infectious diseases - even when little is known about the transmission characteristics of the new infection.The 2014 Ebola epidemic hit some West African districts very hard, while leaving other districts untouched. Yet there is no evidence that the transmission of the Ebola virus differed between those districts, according to Backer and Wallinga at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health (RIVM).By comparing the notification records in all districts of 3 affected countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia), the researchers could trace back how the virus spread through each district and how it traveled from one district to another. Their research shows that each infective infected on average 2 new cases in the beginning of the epidemic, and that most of the infected individuals (at least 90 percent) did not leave their district. Some districts were hit harder because infection was introduced earlier and because infections were introduced more often...more...][This approach to analysis of outbreaks that occur across adjacent geographic areas should also be useful in analysis of outbreaks of mosquito-borne viral diseases such as Zika, chikungunya, and dengue, among many others. - Mod.LK]Economy-----4 Dec 2016: Nigeria, Morocco in joint gas venture<http://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00047710.html>[According to a Moroccan government official, Nigeria and Morocco are set to jointly promote a gas pipeline that will accelerate electricity and energy generation, and assist other African countries. Speaking to State House Correspondents, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Geoffrey Onyema, said the gas pipeline project would also accelerate energy and electrification projects across the affected member countries.][If this helps bring electricity to Sierra Leone, that will be good, as the country is suffering from a serious lack of reliable electricity.

Un-electrified, mainly rural, areas of Sierra Leone primarily use small diesel or petrol generators and kerosene to meet their energy needs. This costs far more than energy in urban areas, which benefit from grid connection and subsidised tariffs. This also limits opportunities for rural people to use modern technology to access information; to light their homes without polluting the air and harming their health, and their ability to use electric motors to pump clean drinking water from source. Savings achieved through eliminating the use of kerosene have been shown to enable children to attend school one year longer.Most public buildings in rural areas, for instance health clinics, lack connectivity to the electricity grid, or have unreliable supply. This means there is insufficient lighting for obstetric and other care at night, and it is difficult to maintain cold storage for essential medicines. During Sierra Leone's Ebola outbreak, the lack of reliable power generation was a major obstacle to the country's ability to both deal with and quickly recover from the emergency.Sierra Leone's Minister of Energy, the Department for International Development (DFID, known in country as UK Aid) and UNOPS [United Nations Office for Project Services] gathered this week at the 1st steering committee meeting to launch the Rural Renewable Energy Project. Over the next 4 years, half a million people will benefit from at least 90 mini-grids powered with renewable energy. Initially 50 communities, including their health centers, will be electrified in 2017 using mini-grids that will be operated by local entrepreneurs. ...more][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow
