Invasive Meningococcal Disease: 2016; Los Angeles County Epidemiology Report [edited]<http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/IMD2016.pdf>Since May 2016, 9 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease among adult men have been reported in Southern California, including 1 death. This represents an increase above the typical number of reported cases. 6 of the cases are known to be caused by serogroup C, and an additional case is awaiting serogroup identification. 4 cases occurred among residents of LAC [Los Angeles County] (excluding Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments) with no associated deaths. The other 5 cases occurred in neighboring health jurisdictions. Most cases have occurred in the past 4 weeks. To date, public health investigation has not determined any common social linkages among LAC gay/MSM [men who have sex with men] cases with the other cases in the region. Based on these recent cases, LAC DPH [Department of Health] is reiterating its 2014 recommendation that gay/MSM who are HIV-positive or are at increased risk of IMD [invasive meningococcal disease] receive meningococcal vaccination (shown below). Additionally, on [22 Jun 2016], the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend that all persons with HIV infection who are 2 months of age and older be routinely vaccinated with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) vaccine, which protects against serogroup C, as well as serogroups A, W, and Y.Table 1.

The Figure from the source URL shows 5 cases, although the text says only 4 cases, occurred in Los Angeles County (LAC) since May 1 2016, with no deaths. Also according to the LAC report above, in LAC since the beginning of the year [2016], there were 9 cases: 6 were male, 4 were MSM and 4 were serogroup C -- the Table, however, does not say if the 4 serogroup C cases were MSM.Another anonymous EpiCore member pointed out that the LAC Department of Public Health reported in 2 Apr 2014 (<http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/MeningVaxRecsProvidersApril2014.pdf>) that in the 1st 3 months of 2014 there was ""a total of 8 IMD cases. Of these 8 cases, 4 cases were reported among MSM, including 3 men who were HIVÛ positive. There have been 3 deaths, all occurring in MSM, 2 of whom were HIVÛ positive.""Many thanks to the EpiCore members who supplied this information. - Mod.MLThe state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.
