WHO [edited]<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/ebola-zero-liberia/en/>Today [14 Jan 2016], WHO declares the end of the most recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Liberia and says all known chains of transmission have been stopped in West Africa. But the Organization says the job is not over, more flare-ups are expected and that strong surveillance and response systems will be critical in the months to come.Liberia was first declared free of Ebola transmission in May 2015, but the virus was re-introduced twice since then, with the latest flare-up in November [2015]. Today's announcement comes 42 days (2 x 21-day incubation cycles of the virus) after the last confirmed patient in Liberia tested negative for the disease 2 times.All 3 countries at zero-----------------------""WHO commends Liberia's government and people on their effective response to this recent re-emergence of Ebola,"" says Dr Alex Gasasira, WHO Representative in Liberia. ""The rapid cessation of the flare-up is a concrete demonstration of the government's strengthened capacity to manage disease outbreaks. WHO will continue to support Liberia in its effort to prevent, detect and respond to suspected cases.""This date marks the 1st time since the start of the epidemic 2 years ago that all 3 of the hardest-hit countries -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone -- have reported 0 cases for at least 42 days. Sierra Leone was declared free of Ebola transmission on 7 Nov 2015 and Guinea on 29 Dec 2015.""Detecting and breaking every chain of transmission has been a monumental achievement,"" says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. ""So much was needed and so much was accomplished by national authorities, heroic health workers, civil society, local, and international organizations and generous partners. But our work is not done and vigilance is necessary to prevent new outbreaks.""Vigilance needs to be maintained--------------------------------WHO cautions that the 3 countries remain at high risk of additional small outbreaks of Ebola, like the most recent one in Liberia. To date, 10 such flare-ups have been identified that were not part of the original outbreak, and are likely the result of the virus persisting in survivors even after recovery. Evidence shows that the virus disappears relatively quickly from survivors, but can remain in the semen of a small number of male survivors for as long as one year, and in rare instances, be transmitted to intimate partners.""We are now at a critical period in the Ebola epidemic as we move from managing cases and patients to managing the residual risk of new infections,"" says Dr Bruce Aylward, WHO's Special Representative for the Ebola Response. ""The risk of re-introduction of infection is diminishing as the virus gradually clears from the survivor population, but we still anticipate more flare-ups and must be prepared for them. A massive effort is underway to ensure robust prevention, surveillance, and response capacity across all 3 countries by the end of March [2016].""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Sierra Leone: new case confirmedDate: Thu 14 Jan 2016Source: BBC News [accessed 14 Jan 2016, edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35320363>Health officials in Sierra Leone have confirmed a death from Ebola, hours after the World Health Organization declared the West Africa outbreak over.The country was declared free of the virus on 7 Nov 2016, and the region as a whole cleared when Liberia was pronounced Ebola-free on Thu 14 Jan 2016. But 2 tests conducted on a boy who died in northern Sierra Leone proved positive for the virus, a health ministry spokesman told the BBC. It is not clear when the boy died.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[I don't think we can expect zero cases, but as long as the number doesn't explode into extended transmission, that is success in my mind. - Mod.LKA zoonotic niche map of the countries where cases have occurred in the field or been imported is at <http://healthmap.org/ebola>.
