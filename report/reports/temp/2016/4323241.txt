Campos J, Cristino L, Peixe L, Antunes P.Abstract------The _mcr-1_ gene was found in 11 isolates from a Portuguese _Salmonella_ collection (nÛø=Ûø1010; 58 serotypes; 2002-15) of clinical samples, foodstuff, food-animals and water. _Mcr-1_ has been located on different plasmids (IncX4/IncHI2) in pig-associated multidrug-resistant, copper-tolerant S.1,4,[5],12:i:-/ST34 and _S. Rissen_/ST469 clones from human and pork products since at least 2011. Our data highlight dissemination of _mcr-1_ by successful resistant clones in Europe and raise questions about the efficacy of copper-based interventions to reduce colistin use.Since the description of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoded by the _mcr-1_ gene in Enterobacteriaceae from multiple sources in China [1] and its worldwide dissemination mostly in animal sources [2], the use of polymyxins (colistin) in food-producing animals has been questioned in Europe because it may have an impact on human health [3]. Nevertheless, data on the transmission of _mcr-1_-mediated colistin resistance particularly by clonal expansion are lacking [3,4]. In fact, the _mcr-1_ gene has been found in zoonotic food-borne bacteria such as _Salmonella_ [2] but the presence of this gene in particular successful resistant clones has not been demonstrated [3]. In this study, we report the presence of the _mcr-1_ gene in pig-associated clinically relevant _Salmonella_ serotypes and clones recovered from human clinical samples and pork products in Portugal, collected as early as 2011.Laboratory investigationWe analysed a total of 1010 _Salmonella_ isolates of 58 serotypes from several sources (human clinical cases, food products, food-animal production settings and aquatic environments) and regions of Portugal, collected between 2002 and 2015 (Table 1). The isolates were screened for the _mcr-1_ gene by PCR and sequencing, using primers CLR5-F (5å«-CGGTCAGTCCGTTTGTTC-3å«) [1] and Mcr1-Rv2 (5å«-CCAGCGTATCCAGCACATTT-3å«) [this study].Detection of _mcr-1_ gene in pig-associated clinically-relevant clonesThe _mcr-1_ gene was detected in 11 (1.1%) of the 1010 Portuguese _Salmonella_ isolates, recovered from human clinical sources and pork food products from across the country (Table 1, Table 2). This gene had 100% homology with the 1st published _mcr-1_ sequence in an _Escherichia coli_ strain from China (GenBank accession number: KP347127) [1], which was further described in diverse other Enterobacteriaceae including sporadic _Salmonella_ isolates from European countries (France, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom) [2,11-14]. In most of these studies, detection of _mcr-1_ gene was only performed in colistin-resistant isolates. This impairs the determination of its real prevalence because the gene may be silent, as described in one _E. coli_ strain [15]. All our isolates carrying the _mcr-1_ gene presented a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4-8 mg/L for resistance to colistin (Table 2).During the study period (2002 to 2015), _Salmonella_ isolates harbouring the _mcr-1_ gene were only recovered between 2011 and 2015 and originated from human clinical sources (0.8%, nÛä=Ûä4/522) and pork products, mostly from slaughterhouses, (2.4%, nÛä=Ûä7/296) (Table 1). Colistin has been widely used in veterinary medicine, particularly in food-producing animals, primarily in pigs [16,17]. The available data from 2004 to 2006 had already shown high use of colistin for food-producing animals in Portugal [18], which is one of the European countries with highest consumption of polymyxins that has been increasing in the last years (2011-13) [3,19]. Taking into account the current picture of colistin use in Portugal, the detection of _mcr-1_ in the most recent collections and in pork products is of concern. Nevertheless, data on chronology, current prevalence of the _mcr-1_ gene and its evolution in bacteria from animals, food and humans are lacking [3].The 11 _mcr-1_-positive _Salmonella_ isolates belonged to the serotypes _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- and S. Rissen (Table 2), which have been strongly associated with pig production and caused human infections in Europe [5,6,20-22] including in Portugal [23]. In both cases, we found them associated with particular successful multidrug-resistant (MDR) clonal lineages, either of the _S._ Rissen/ST469 clone or the _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:-/ST34 European clone that is currently spreading epidemically in European countries [5,20,22] and has been dominant in our _Salmonella_ collection for the last years [5,6,20; unpublished data]. A previous report on _mcr-1_ in the clinically relevant _Salmonella_ serotype _S._ Typhimurium/ST34 was associated with travel to South-East Asia [13].Of note, all _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- and _S._ Rissen _mcr-1_-carrying isolates were co-resistant to antibiotics used in a human and/or veterinary context and carried diverse metal tolerance genes, remarkably those conferring tolerance to copper (all carrying pcoDÛä+ÛäsilA on the chromosome) (Table 2), a feed additive mostly used for pigs or piglets in Europe. The fact that these successful clones presented higher tolerance to copper, as previously demonstrated [6,20], can contribute to their selection and wider expansion with potential repercussions for _mcr-1_ transmission.Location of _mcr-1_ gene in diverse plasmid backbonesThe _mcr-1_ gene was located on 2 plasmid types, IncX4 (nÛä=Ûä5; 35 kb; 4 transferable) and IncHI2 (nÛä=Ûä6), either of ST4 subtype (nÛä=Ûä3; 200-300 kb; all transferable) or non-typeable (nÛä=Ûä3; 120-125 kb; all non-transferable) and mostly associated with the ISApl1 transposable element (Table 2). IncHI2/ST4 and IncX4 plasmids have been widely implicated in the spread of _mcr-1_ gene in diverse _Salmonella_ serotypes and other Enterobacteriaceae in European and non-European countries, both from human and animal sources [2,12-14]. Transferability of the _mcr-1_ gene was achieved from _S._ Rissen (n=Ûä1) and _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- (nÛä=Ûä6) isolates and was associated with a 32-64-fold increase in the colistin MIC and, in some isolates, with acquisition of resistance to other antibiotics and metals tolerance genes (Table 2). The fact that successful MDR _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- and _S._ Rissen clones have the ability to acquire plasmids carrying the _mcr-1_ gene is of concern because colistin resistance may contribute to their further expansion, particularly in the pig reservoir. In addition, those strains could act as reservoir of _mcr-1_-carrying plasmids with a broad host range enhancing colistin resistance transmission for other clinically relevant bacteria sharing the same ecological niche.ConclusionsThis study has evidenced the acquisition of _mcr-1_-carrying plasmids by two clinically relevant MDR and copper-tolerant clones of _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- and _S._ Rissen, strongly associated with pork food products and which were dominant in the collection studied. The detection of _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- from human infections, already in 2011, is also of note, suggesting long-term dissemination of this resistance gene in humans in Portugal. Finally, the detection of _mcr-1_ in copper-tolerant clones raises questions about the efficacy of recently suggested metal-based interventions (e.g. copper) to reduce the use of colistin and contain _mcr-1_ dissemination [3].[The full article, including Tables and References, is available at the source URL.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Copper has been used as a supplement in animal husbandry for growth promotion, especially in pigs. Copper's growth promotion effect has been attributed to its antimicrobial activity, similar to that of antibiotics (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20482227>). Manure from copper-fed animals applied to soil has resulted in increased copper levels in soil (<http://www.academia.edu/6566627/Copper_content_in_animal_manures_and_potential_risk_of_soil_copper_pollution_with_animal_manure_use_in_agriculture>). Copper fed to animals at elevated concentrations may select for gut bacteria that are resistant not only to copper but also to antibiotics, such as colistin, whose resistance is genetically linked to that of copper. In fact, the above study demonstrated that the _mcr-1_ gene, located on a plasmid, apparently linked to genes encoding copper resistance, was transferable to other bacteria, and its transference was associated with acquisition of resistance to colistin as well as tolerance to copper. The genetic linkage of copper and colistin resistance implies that use of copper in animal husbandry can select for colistin resistance, even in the absence of colistin usage. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42>.]
