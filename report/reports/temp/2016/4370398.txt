CIDRAP [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/07/avian-flu-scan-jul-25-2016>Egypt recently reported 3 new H5N1 avian flu cases, all in people who had been exposed to poultry or their environments, according to a monthly update from the World Health Organization (WHO) on animal-to-human flu transmission events for the middle of June through the middle of July 2016.One of the patients is a 2-year-old boy from Cairo who got sick on 30 May 2016 and whose H5N1 illness was detected as part of flulike illness surveillance. He was hospitalized, treated with antivirals for pneumonia, and recovered. Before he became ill, the boy had visited a family member who raised birds.The other 2 are a 30-year-old woman from Menia governorate whose symptoms began on 11 Jun 2016 and an 8-year-old girl from Cairo governorate who got sick on 18 Jun 2016. Both had been exposed to poultry or their environments, were hospitalized with pneumonia, and recovered after antiviral treatment.The WHO said no other cases were detected in any of the patients' contacts and that H5N1 is endemic in Egyptian poultry.So far, 8 H5N1 cases have been reported globally this year [2016], all of them in Egypt. The WHO said since 2003, 854 cases have been reported, 450 of them fatal, from 16 countries.In related developments, the WHO recently noted 7 more H7N9 avian flu cases reported from China on 12 Jul 2016, 4 of them fatal. In a 22 Jul 2016 statement, the WHO said onset dates range from 26 May to 23 Jun 2016, with ages spanning 52 to 68 years.The patients were from 6 provinces and cities. Four of the patients are men, and 5 reported exposure to poultry or their environments before they became ill. One worked a market where live poultry is sold. None of the cases reflect human-to-human transmission, the agency said.Most of the cases had been noted earlier in other official reports from Chinese government agencies, according to FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board. It put the global total at 800 cases since the 1st human cases were detected in 2012.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Human cases of H5N1 influenza continue to be reported from Egypt sporadically, generally in tandem with backyard or commercial poultry deaths in the surrounding regions and close contact of patients with poultry.A combination of factors, including recently increased H5N1 circulation in poultry in Egypt, as evidenced by an increased number of outbreak reports, may be partly responsible, along with an increase in the number of small farms and household flocks and lower risk awareness among the public and farmers, which could put people in closer proximity to poultry and create a more favorable environment for virus survival. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55>.]
