All 3 newly confirmed cases have been reported in the past week. The one asymptomatic infection was reported today [17 Oct 2016] in a healthcare worker with presumed exposure to the newly reported case in Hufoof from 15 Oct 2016.In past years, October has been a month with increased MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia, although most of the activity was seen in nosocomial outbreaks. In recent months, there have been occasional secondary cases in household contacts and occasional healthcare workers, but large nosocomial outbreaks have not occurred since the outbreak in June 2016 in Riyadh. Hopefully, nosocomial outbreaks are now a ""thing of the past.""Maps showing the locations of these cases can be found at the source URLs.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
