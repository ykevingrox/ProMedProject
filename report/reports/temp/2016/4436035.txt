AZCentral, The Republic [edited]<http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2016/08/20/phoenix-cryptosporidium-outbreak/89019406/>More than 100 people in the Phoenix area [Maricopa County, Arizona] have been sickened in an outbreak of the diarrhea-causing parasite _Cryptosporidium parvum_, and Maricopa County officials have identified more than 20 recreational water facilities -- including splash pads, water parks, and public pools -- that may have been contaminated.County officials on [Fri 19 Aug 2016] declined to identify the recreational water facilities where patients said they had been swimming prior to developing symptoms or while sick.Dr Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, said there is no reliable test to detect crypto in water, so it's hard to know the source of outbreak. But she said each facility has been working with the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department to follow CDC-recommended procedures for decontamination.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, crypto and other germs that cause recreational water illnesses can be spread by swallowing water contaminated with fecal matter. Most of these germs, such as _E. coli_ or _Giardia_, are killed or neutralized within minutes of exposure to chlorine. Crypto, however, is not affected by normal levels of chlorination and can live for days, even in well-maintained water venues.Individuals affected by the parasite will begin experiencing diarrhea about a week after exposure. Other symptoms include stomach cramps, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss.Symptoms last for 2 to 10 days. People with healthy immune systems usually recover in 1 to 2 weeks without treatment.The outbreak in Maricopa County was first recognized by health officials on [4 Aug 2016].Most of the sufferers have been young; the median age in cases reported so far is 11, said Courtney Kreuzwiesner, a public health spokeswoman. The oldest patient is 70.""We know that for every case reported to public health, there are many more people that have not been diagnosed,"" Sunenshine said. ""... Honestly, this is a very contagious organism, and as long as swimming season is going on, we're going to continue to see cases. That's why we're really asking the public to do their part.""Sunenshine said parents taking their children to aquatic venues should remind them not to swallow the water and have them take frequent bathroom breaks. To avoid spreading the disease, health officials have these recommendations:- do not swim or play in recreational water (pools, hot tubs, splash pads, lakes, rivers, etc.) if you have diarrhea and for at least 2 weeks after the diarrhea stops;- wash hands with soap and water thoroughly before preparing food and after toileting or diapering; alcohol based hand sanitizer is not effective against crypto;- avoid food preparation while symptoms last;- children with diarrhea should be excluded from childcare settings until the  diarrhea has stopped.[Byline: Lindsey Collom]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Cryptosporidium_ is endemic in the USA and outbreaks in recreational water facilities like public swimming pools and fountain parks are well known. This outbreak is multicenter, which could indicate that the water used for these activities is contaminated, and not that contamination arises from introduction of fecal material into the water.In the recommendations to users of these facilities listed above, we miss a recommendation to use diapers on children not yet trained to use a toilet. Special diapers for use in swimming pools are available. - Mod.EPThe state of Arizona can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1124>.
