Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/egypt-1st-human-h5n1-avian-influenza-infection-of-2016/>Egypt reported some 160 human cases of H5N1 avian influenza during 2014-2015, by far the most cases the country ever reported.On [Mon 7 Mar 2016], the FAO/EMPRES reported on the 1st case in 2016, according to an Avian Flu Diary report published today [8 Mar 2016]. Very little information is available other than the case was reported from Sohag, Akhmem District, and an observation date of 25 Feb 2016.The number of confirmed cases in Egypt since 2003 now stands at 347 and the global total is now 847.H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or ""bird flu""). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person-to-person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is surprising that this case is considered the 1st human case of H5N1 in Egypt, as one case was reported from Kafr el-Sheikh on 25 Jan 2016 (see ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (15): Egypt (KS) H5N1 susp, RFI 20160126.3967941). Perhaps that suspected case proved to be seasonal flu. Regardless, there appear to have been few if any previous cases in Egypt this year to date, interesting since 2014-2015 transmission season was the largest outbreak of human H5N1 infection on record in Egypt. - Mod.LK]Maps of Egypt can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4048>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Response to RFI in Avian influenza, human (23): Egypt (DQ) susp, RFI 20160215.4023410Date: Mon 15 Feb 2016From: Joseph Dudley <jpdudley@alaska.edu> [edited]If these reports are correct in reporting there may have been as many as 9 deaths of children from H5N1 in Egypt during the 1st 2 weeks of Feb 2016. This is a very unusual occurrence that warrants immediate investigation.During the past decade, there have been very few deaths of young children in Egypt from H5N1 avian influenza.During the early years of H5N1 in Egypt, fatal cases in children were extremely rare: there were no reported fatalities among the 33 cases recorded in children younger than 10 years old reported as of April 2009 (Dudley 2009). Between 2006-2010, fatalities were reported for only 2 of 47 cases in children 0-5 years old (4%: Fasina et al 2010; Oner et al 2012).There were almost as many human cases recorded in a 5-month period from November 2014-April 2015 as during the previous 8 years since the 1st human cases in Egypt were reported, and there has been speculation that the 2014-2015 H5N1 epidemic may be related to the emergence of a new strain of the H5N1 virus 2,2,1 clade, (Arafa et al 2015).A paper published in December 2015 reported that the human morbidity and mortality patterns associated with the massive resurgence of H5N1 in Egypt last year (2015) were similar to those documented previously in this country (Rafaey et al 2015).The possibility that there have been this many putative fatal H5N1 cases among young children is an anomaly that should be investigated immediately, given the prior history and epidemiology of human H5N1 cases in Egypt.References----------1.
