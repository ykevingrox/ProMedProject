Outbreak of _Neisseria meningitidis_ capsular group W among scouts returning from the World Scout Jamboree, Japan, 2015. Euro Surveill. 2016; 21(45): pii=30392.----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------The 23rd World Scout Jamboree was held in [Yamaguchi City, Yamaguchi Prefecture] Japan from [28 Jul to 8 Aug 2015] and was attended by over 33 000 scouts from 162 countries. An outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease capsular group W was investigated among participants, with 4 confirmed cases identified in Scotland, who were all associated with one particular scout unit [3 scouts and 1 close contact of a scout who was not one of the 3 cases and had no close contact with a case], and 2 confirmed cases [a scout and scout leader who were both associated with one particular scout unit] in Sweden; molecular testing showed the same strain to be responsible for illness in both countries. [The _Neisseria meningitidis_ strain was found to be W: P1.5,2,36-2: F1-1: ST-11 (cc11)]. The report describes the public health action taken to prevent further cases and the different decisions reached with respect to how wide to extend the offer of chemoprophylaxis in the 2 countries; in Scotland, chemoprophylaxis was offered to the unit of 40 participants [36 scouts, mean age, 16.4 years, and 4 adult leaders] to which the 4 cases belonged and to other close contacts of cases, while in Sweden chemoprophylaxis was offered to all those returning from the jamboree. The report also describes the international collaboration and communication required to investigate and manage such multinational outbreaks in a timely manner.[There were no cases of invasive meningococcal disease reported in Japan associated with the jamboree.

An international invasive meningococcal disease outbreak due to a novel and rapidly expanding serogroup W strain, Scotland and Sweden, July to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2016; 21(45) :pii=30395.-------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------The 23rd World Scout Jamboree in 2015 took place in Japan and included over 33 000 scouts from 162 countries. Within 9 days of the meeting ending, 6 cases of laboratory-confirmed invasive serogroup W meningococcal disease occurred among scouts and their close contacts in Scotland and Sweden. The isolates responsible were identical to one-another by routine typing and, where known (4 isolates), belonged to the ST-11 clonal complex (cc11) which is associated with large outbreaks and high case fatality rates. Recent studies have demonstrated the need for high-resolution genomic typing schemes to assign serogroup W cc11 isolates to several distinct strains circulating globally over the past two decades. Here we used such schemes to confirm that the Jamboree-associated cases constituted a genuine outbreak and that this was due to a novel and rapidly expanding strain descended from the strain that has recently expanded in South America and the United Kingdom. We also identify the genetic differences that define the novel strain including 4 point mutations and 3 putative recombination events involving the horizontal exchange of 17, 6, and 2 genes, respectively. Noteworthy outcomes of these changes were antigenic shifts and the disruption of a transcriptional regulator.[The full article is available at the source URL above. - Mod.ML]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Molecular testing indicated that the same strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ was responsible for the 4 Scottish and 2 Swedish cases of invasive meningococcal disease associated with the 23rd World Scout Jamboree in Japan in 2015.One of the cases presented with meningitis and shock and was treated in intensive care for 6 days. The other 5 cases were said to have exhibited mild non-specific and/or atypical respiratory symptoms and all cases recovered with no apparent sequelae.Chemoprophylaxis was administered to 53 Scottish scouts and leaders in one scout unit and their close contacts and all were also offered quadrivalent ACWY conjugate vaccine. In Sweden, chemoprophylaxis was offered initially to all those returning from the jamboree because the cases at first were not known to have been associated with the same scout unit.The epidemic strain was found to be serogroup W and all were sequence type (ST) 11. ST-11 clonal complex (cc11) is associated with multiple serogroups, a tendency to cause outbreaks, atypical clinical presentations, and relatively high case fatality rates. Serogroup C cc11, for example, has caused outbreaks in military recruits, university undergraduates, and more recently, an outbreak in Tuscany Italy (ProMED-mail see alsos below) and an outbreak in men who have sex with men in North American and Europe (ProMED-mail see alsos below). Serogroup W cc11 was responsible for the global Hajj-associated outbreak in 2000 (ProMED-mail see also's below), followed by several large epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa (ProMED-mail see also's below), and the expansion of endemic disease in South Africa, South America, and Europe. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/280>.]
