The Sentinel [edited]<http://www.sentinelassam.com/mainnews/story.php?sec=1&subsec=0&id=290607&dtP=2016-12-07&ppr=1#.WEgHs3eZN-U>Assam has recorded the highest number of Japanese encephalitis (JE) deaths in the country this year [2016].According to latest National Health Mission (NHM) figures, Assam has recorded highest number of JE casualties in the country with 85 death cases. Uttar Pradesh recorded the 2nd highest number with 68 JE deaths, followed by Odisha with 39 JE deaths.From 1 Jan-27 Nov [2016], as many as 183 persons died of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), while 85 persons succumbed to Japanese encephalitis (JE) -- as per the table drawn up by the directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) under NHM. Further, during this period, total 416 JE cases and 1668 AES cases were confirmed in the State.Overall, in the last 6 years, Assam stood 2nd only to Uttar Pradesh in the total numbers of JE and AES cases recorded.In 2010, Assam recorded 142 JE cases with 40 deaths, and 469 AES cases with 117 deaths. In 2011, there were 1319 AES and 489 JE cases in the State, with 250 dying of AES and 113 of JE.In 2012, the numbers rose to 1343 AES with 229 deaths, and 463 JE cases with 100 deaths in the State. In 2013, there were 1,338 AES cases with 272 deaths, and 495 JE cases with 134 deaths.In 2014, Assam recorded 2194 AES cases with 360 deaths, and 761 cases with 165 deaths. The next year in 2015, there were 1409 AES cases with 260 deaths recorded in Assam, along with 641 JE cases with 135 deaths.Sources have pointed out that despite the Centre pumping huge amounts of funds into Assam to keep vector-borne diseases at bay, such diseases are far from being controlled.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of fatalities in Assam have increased from 66 as of 2 Aug 2016, to 78 fatal cases as of 18 Aug 2016, to the 85 fatal cases to date. As mentioned in previous posts, Assam is probably concluding its usual JE virus transmission season currently. JE virus is endemic in northeastern India and more cases can be expected next year (2017). It seems odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination either in the recent past or plans for a campaign in Assam.The encephalitis situation in northeastern India has been confusing for many years. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. Recent reports from Odisha indicate that only 1/3 of the reported encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections. The remaining 2/3 have been classified as AES with no specific etiology. At last, AES is being addressed there, but no mention is made of similar investigations into the etiologies associated with AES in the above report. The cause of AES has been speculative with other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, having been proposed. Possible etiologies of AES are discussed in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20161111.4621162). The team investigating the outbreak in Odisha has come up with a reliable diagnoses for at least 5 of the dead children as due to consumption of the seeds of _Cassia occidentalis_ (known commonly as coffee senna, negro coffee, rubbish cassia, stinking weed), with folk medicine uses of leaves and roots (see <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S025462990500044X>). Until the specific etiologies of AES are determined, measures to prevent additional cases and to optimise treatment for those affected will not be possible.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299>. - Mod.TY]
