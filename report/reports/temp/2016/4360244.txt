All the young patients had in common a visit in the previous 2 days at the Acquapark in Monreale. None of them hat eaten at the cafeteria of the park and they did not share food.The young patients were kept under observation for 1 or 2 days but no bacterial pathogens were isolated from culture tests on fecal samples. 2 days after discharge, new fecal samples were obtained by the University of Palermo from the 2 children who had been hospitalized at Children's Hospital and the presence of high viral loads of norovirus was demonstrated by molecular methods. The norovirus suspected to be the agent of the outbreak belongs to genogroup II but further typing is ongoing.The resort has been closed for a few days and water from the pool and sources have been controlled by the health district but apparently no bacterial contamination of recreational waters or municipal supply was detected. However, norovirus cannot be easily detected by cultures or antigen tests in water. In the case of sewage-contaminated drinking water or recreational water, biomolecular tests on large amounts of water (that is, at least 10 liters) have to be performed to detect contamination.Primary sources: <http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/01/news/palermo_sette_bimbi_in_ospedale_dopo_tutti_in_acquapark-143219195/>; <http://www.palermotoday.it/cronaca/bambini-ospedale-virus-acquapark-monreale.html> [in Italian].--Giovanni M GiammancoDepartment of Health Promotion Sciences and Mother and Child CareUniversity of PalermoItaly<giovanni.giammanco@unipa.it>[ProMED-mail thanks Giovanni Giammanco for this report regarding possible waterborne transmission of norovirus. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54422>.][See Also:Norovirus - Spain (02): (CT) bottled water 20160427.4186835Norovirus - Philippines: (ZAS)Norovirus - Spain: (CT) bottled water 20160419.4170111Norovirus: prolonged viral shedding post infection, research 20160111.39273802015----Norovirus update (03): USA (MN, CA) new strain (MN), RFI 20151228.3896625Norovirus - middle & high income countries: elderly, retrospective studies 20151019.3724752Norovirus update (02): Italy, novel Kawasaki strain 20150904.3622339Gastroenteritis - Macedonia: Dutch-holidaymakers, norovirus susp. 20150819.3589707Gastroenteritis - USA (PA) Cowans Gap, norovirus 20150729.3545782Norovirus update (01) 20150724.3534291Norovirus - China: (GD) 20150409.32877552012----Norovirus - UK (05): early onset 20121229.1474387Norovirus - UK (02): (Scotland), open-water swimmers, comment 20120723.1212112Norovirus - UK: (Scotland), open-water swimmers 20120722.1210889].................................................ll/mj/dk"
