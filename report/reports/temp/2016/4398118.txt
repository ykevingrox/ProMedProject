Eastern Mirror [edited]<http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/who-doctors-in-myanmars-naga-areas-identify-mystery-disease/>The ""mystery"" disease that has claimed the lives of at least 40 children in northwestern Myanmar since mid-June [2016] was identified as measles by doctors on [Fri 5 Aug 2016]. The region where the illness has hit borders eastern India and is populated by people from the Naga tribes.According to Athung Makury, the president of Council of Naga Affairs (in Myanmar), the assistant director general of Union Public Health, Myanmar, Dr Than Tun Aung, has diagnosed the illness as measles. ""But he could not comment on what type of measles it is exactly,"" according to Makury.He informed Eastern Mirror on [Fri 5 Aug 2016] that a team of doctors from World Health Organization, Myanmar branch have already reached there. 6 doctors from the ""Union Government and Sagaing Regional Government"" have been sent to ""help the infected one"", he informed.Besides, military helicopters would also be sent out soon to reach the villages, according to him. Makury confirmed that the death toll has reached 40 by [Fri 5 Aug 2016], and 9 villages affected by the illness. He also informed that 15 doctors from Nagaland [state in northeast India], along with members of the Naga Mothers' Association [India], would be arriving there soon.On [Fri 5 Aug 2016] several news agencies had reported that ""at least 30 children have died in northwestern Myanmar since mid-June [2016] from an unknown disease that causes breathing difficulty."" The reports quoted a local administrator as saying that deaths have been recorded in Nanyun and Lahe towns in the Naga region [Sagaing division], one of the poorest in the country, about 1300 kilometers [about 808 mi] from Yangon, adjoining India's Nagaland state. He had said most of the victims were been younger than 5.According to the news reports local authorities have temporarily banned people from traveling around to prevent contagion. The Naga area is the least developed part of Myanmar and is in utter neglect with the absence of even the most basic health care, education and infrastructure.The region suffers from inadequate transportation, insufficient number of health care workers and medicine. Because of the backwardness, even curable diseases have proved to be deadly in the past, according to the reports.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above mentions that measles has been identified as a cause of the outbreak and increased mortality in young children in this region of Myanmar. The reports indicate that the region has very little health infrastructure in place and it can be predicted that measles vaccination levels in the population may be quite low.Approximately 30 percent of reported measles cases have one or more complications. Complications of measles are most common among children younger than 5 years of age and adults 20 years of age and older (<http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/complications.html>).Common measles complications include ear infections (1 out of every 10 children with hearing loss) and diarrhea. Severe complications include pneumonia, developing in almost 1 out of every 20 children with measles. Pneumonia is the most common cause of death from measles in young children. Another serious complication is encephalitis; according to CDC data, 'for every 1000 children who get measles, one or 2 will die from it' (<http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/complications.html>).According to WHO guidelines on measles outbreak management (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143956/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK143956.pdf>), after confirmation of a measles outbreak, the primary goal of the outbreak response is to reduce morbidity and mortality by providing appropriate case management and vaccinating children. Secondary goals must include measures to limit the spread of the outbreak; identify high-risk groups/areas for implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage and other control measures; assist in the identification and correction of weaknesses in immunization and surveillance; raise awareness in the community about the disease and its prevention; monitor the changing epidemiology of measlesA start in the affected areas would be provision of health service support and vaccination of children. - Mod.UBAMaps of Myanmar can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/myanmar_map2.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16205>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJProMED-mail thanks to Melissa Dudley for submitting a similar article. - Mod.MPP]
