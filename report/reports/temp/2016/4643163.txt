This study adds interim guidance to recent field reports on the outbreak, providing precautionary recommendations to hospitals and health systems to reduce the risk of infections.""It is surprising that a global outbreak like this could go unnoticed for years. This dangerous infection has put many patients at risk all over the world,"" said Rami Sommerstein, MD, of Inselspital, Bern University Hospital in Switzerland, the lead author of the study. ""Now that we know HCDs are the source, individual action from the different players (healthcare institutions, manufacturers, etc.) is needed to contain the ongoing patient risk. The most important action a hospital can take is to remove contaminated HCDs from the operating room and other critical areas. That is the only way to ensure that patients are protected from this infection moving forward.""HCDs are stand-alone devices needed for heat exchange in heart-lung machines used in some 250 000 surgeries annually in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In response to an increasing number of infections, investigators looked into hospital water sources and found _M. chimaera_ in HCD water circuits -- specifically, in the LivaNova 3T HCD used in most hospitals around the world. They also found the bacteria in air samples during surgeries with LivaNova HCDs, suggesting transmission through air particles.To prevent future cases of invasive _M. chimaera_ infections, the researchers made the following recommendations for hospitals and health systems, as well as public health authorities, based on their personal experience with the outbreak:- ensure strict separation of contaminated HCDs from air of critical medical areas;- educate clinicians on the risks for and dangers associated with _M. chimaera_;- screen patients who had open heart surgery, heart transplantation, or those who were exposed to ventricular assist devices and demonstrate prolonged and unexplained fevers._M. chimaera_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium that was previously known to cause lung infections. Invasive _M. chimaera_ in cardiac surgery patients is particularly difficult to treat because it requires surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy. ""While our understanding of the causes and the extent of the _M. chimaera_ outbreak is growing, several aspects of patient management, device handling, and risk mitigation still require clarification,"" said Sommerstein.1.

[Epub ahead of print]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------""An outbreak of invasive _Mycobacterium chimaera_ infections associated with heater-cooler devices (HCDs) has now affected patients in several countries on different continents. Clinical infections are characterized by delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment response to antimicrobial agents, and poor prognosis. Outbreak investigators found _M. chimaera_ in HCD water circuits and air samples while HCDs were running, suggesting that transmission from the HCD to the surgical site occurs via the airborne route. New HCDs at the manufacturing site were also contaminated with _M. chimaera_, and recent whole-genome sequencing data suggest a point source. Some guidance on screening for _M. chimaera_ colonization in HCD water and exhaust air is available. In contrast, reliable disinfection procedures are not well described, and it is not yet known whether eradication of _M. chimaera_ from a contaminated HCD can be achieved. Meanwhile, strict separation of the HCD from operating room air is necessary to ensure patient safety, and these efforts may require engineering solutions. While our understanding of the causes and the extent of the _M. chimaera_ outbreak is growing, several aspects of patient management, device handling, and risk mitigation still require clarification.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[For discussions of _Mycobacterium chimaera_ infections associated with heater-cooler devices, please see my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts: Non-TB mycobacteria - USA (04): nosocomial, heater-coolers, CDC, FDA 20161015.4561053; Non-TB mycobacteria - USA (03): (PA) nosocom, fatal, heater-coolers, more cases 20160927.4517593; and Non-TB mycobacteria - USA (02): (PA) nosocomial, heater-cooler machine 20160923.4511595. - Mod.ML]
