In 2015, 40 LGV cases were diagnosed, bringing the total for 2010-2015 to 88 cases. The profile of the most affected group, HIV-positive men who have sex with men with a previous sexually transmitted infection, matches that of those described in LGV outbreaks in Western Europe.In this report we present data on 83 lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) cases from a total number of 88 LGV cases reported in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2015, with 40 cases reported in 2015 alone.Background-----------LGV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the L1, L2 and L3 serovars of _Chlamydia trachomatis_ [1]. Since 2003, LGV has been endemic in western European men who have sex with men (MSM) [1]. Recently, the number of reported cases has been increasing in countries like the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands and Spain [2-5]. The 1st case who presented with typical clinical manifestations compatible with LGV in eastern and central Europe was detected in 2010 in the Czech Republic at the Dermatovenerology department, Na Bulovce Hospital, Prague, in cooperation with the associated AIDS-Centre and the National Reference Laboratory for _Chlamydia_ (NRL) in Prague [6]. Over the last five years, we have noticed an increasing number of patients with LGV in the Czech Republic. Additionally, four cases of LGV in HIV-positive Hungarian men were diagnosed between November 2012 and February 2014 in Hungary [7]. Data from other countries in eastern and central Europe are not publically available.Discussion-------In this report we provide data on LGV diagnoses from one reference centre to understand the trends and epidemiology of this infection in a country in eastern/central Europe. The characteristics of the patients in our centre are very similar to those in the Netherlands and the UK [3,9]. The diagnosis of LGV is predominantly in HIV-positive MSM with a previous history of STIs. Given that our centre is the referral centre for the whole country, patients from other parts of the Czech Republic and not only from Prague were diagnosed here. Thus, our data suggest that LGV infection is spreading in the Czech Republic. Only one report from Hungary published in 2015 described four cases of LGV [7]. The lack of data from eastern and central Europe contrasts sharply with the situation in Western Europe, where several outbreaks have been reported recently [2,4]. This may be due to lower awareness among clinicians in these countries, or less testing and reporting, or less transmission.The increasing number of LGV cases in the Czech Republic is probably due to several interconnected reasons. LGV is an infection predominantly found in HIV-positive MSM. The number of HIV-positive patients in the Czech Republic has been steadily growing by 10-15% every year over the last two decades [10]. More than 80% of these newly diagnosed HIV patients in the Czech Republic are MSM. According to the anecdotal evidence, sexual tourism in the Czech HIV-positive MSM community is also quite widespread. Several patients with confirmed infections in our study reported having had sexual contacts with foreigners from Western Europe (Germany, Spain, UK) where LGV outbreaks have been described recently [1,2,4]. These imported infections may be further spreading in some subgroups of the local Czech MSM community with high-risk sexual behaviour. This conclusion is supported by the increasing number of gonococcal, non-LGV chlamydial and syphilis cases within this subgroup.LGV is mandatorily notifiable in the Czech Republic [11]. The very small number of cases notified by other departments may be explained by the low level of awareness among dermatovenerologists, proctologists and urologists in the region. This fact is reflected in the cases with rectal symptoms. These patients were not requested to disclose information about having had receptive anal sex or about having been tested for _C. trachomatis_ infection. Six patients with rectal LGV infection in our group were treated for IBD over the course of several months prior to the correct diagnosis. Four patients received immunosuppressive treatment (azathioprine, systemic corticosteroids), which aggravated their problems. It is therefore also necessary to educate gastroenterologists to check the patient's clinical history for receptive anal intercourse and to perform tests for _C. trachomatis_ in men with IBD symptoms [12].Another problem is the very limited number of laboratories which are able to perform confirmatory tests. In the Czech Republic, this confirmatory test can only be performed by one laboratory (NRL). We are not aware of any other laboratory in the region that does routinely this form of testing.The question also remains as to the level of awareness that exists in the other countries of the eastern and central European region because the patients with the LGV infection in our cohort also reported having had sexual contacts with individuals from other countries in the region (Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). It is therefore possible that there is a similar trend in these countries as well.Nearly half of the patients in our group had another previously undiagnosed sexually transmitted co-infection at the time of the LGV diagnosis. This reinforces the need for testing for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis C and also for gonococcal infections in these patients. In our study, 24 (28.4%) of the LGV infections were asymptomatic. These asymptomatic LGV cases were only diagnosed through NAATs screening of chlamydial infections in patients with newly diagnosed syphilis. Our department introduced this form of screening in 2009 because of the high number of asymptomatic gonococcal and chlamydial predominantly rectal infections. The percentage of asymptomatic infections in our group was almost identical to a recently published study from the UK [13]. Since nine patients had pharyngeal and urethral LGV, we recommend testing not only rectal samples, but also samples from the urethra and pharynx in high-risk patients. Asymptomatic or undiagnosed patients can quickly spread the infection within the MSM community because of frequent change of sexual partners and because having concurrent relationships are common in some parts of the MSM community [14,15]. The early diagnosis of symptomatic patients, tracing the sexual contacts of patients with confirmed LGV, and screening of asymptomatic high-risk patients (HIV-positive MSM with risky sexual behaviour) may help to control the spread of LGV. It is also necessary to educate patients about the risks of the disease, symptoms, protection, and points of contact in case of symptoms.The main limitation of this report is that we are only presenting data from one centre; however, this is because we are the only centre that systematically focuses on LGV infections in our region. The number of reported asymptomatic LGV cases at our clinic may be higher compared to other centres due to the routine _C. trachomatis_ screening we carry out on patients with newly diagnosed syphilis. We are not able to report the proportion of LGV positive tests from all tests performed for _C. trachomatis_ because positive tests in heterosexual patients were not further tested for LGV.Conclusion--------The increasing number of patients with LGV in our department suggests that the LGV infection is already established and spreading in the Czech Republic and may be present in other countries in the region. Dermatologists, proctologists and gastroenterologists must be more aware of this condition, particularly in patients with rectal symptoms. To keep the situation under control, it is necessary to intensify testing and screening for chlamydial infections and LGV confirmation in eastern and central Europe.[The full report, including the references, is available at the source URL.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_ serovars L1, L2, or L3. In 2012 ProMED-mail posted a report of 4 cases of LGV proctitis in men who had sex with men (MSM) in 2010-2011 in the Czech Republic (ProMED-mail post Lymphogranuloma venereum - Europe: (Czech Republic, Spain) increase 20120116.1011622). All cases were HIV-infected MSM who used sex toys; 3 of them had had numerous sexual contacts. The above report updates the data on LGV from the Czech Republic: a total number of 88 LGV cases were reported in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2015, with 40 cases reported in 2015 alone. Anecdotal evidence suggested to the investigators that sexual tourism in the Czech HIV-positive MSM community from Western Europe, where LGV outbreaks have been described recently, may explain the outbreak of LGV in the Czech Republic. The diagnosis of LGV is suspected in patients with a compatible clinical presentation. Serology (complement fixation titers greater than 1:64 or microimmunofluorescence titers greater than 1:256) can support the diagnosis, but laboratory confirmation depends on detecting _C. trachomatis_- specific DNA, followed by genotyping to identify serovars L1, L2, or L3 to differentiate LGV from non-LGV _C. trachomatis_. However, this technology is not widely available, which the investigators suggest may explain the infrequent reports of this disease in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe. In addition, this clinic in the Czech Republic had a heightened level of clinical awareness for this disease and routinely performed nucleic acid amplification screening for _C. trachomatis_ in rectal, urethral and pharyngeal samples in asymptomatic high-risk patients. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/110>.]
