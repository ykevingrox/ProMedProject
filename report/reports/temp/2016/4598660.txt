The cluster of cases seen suggest a shared etiology. There are shellfish harvesting closures currently in Puget Sound [northwestern coast of Washington state]. Investigation into consumption of shellfish by patients displaying acute flaccid paralysis seems warranted. Cooking of shellfish does not inactivate the toxin. A map of current sites closed to shellfish harvesting can be found at <https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/eh/maps/biotoxin/biotoxin.html>As a veterinarian and veterinary pathologist, I have also diagnosed acute flaccid paralysis in dogs due to tick paralysis. A thorough search of children affected by this syndrome may result in the finding of a tick, often engorged, attached to the skin. Removal of the tick will result in rapid recovery from symptoms.--Valerie Shearn-Bochsler (vbochsler@usgs.gov)USGS National Wildlife Health Center, Madison, WIUSAandProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED thanks Dr Shearn-Bochsler for her response to the recent ProMED post, Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (04): USA 20161030.4596196.CDC is investigating what has led to an increase in acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) cases in 2016. According to their records, as of August 2016, 50 people in 24 states were confirmed to have this serious illness.We thank Dr Shearn-Bochsler, for reminding us of 2 non-infectious causes observed in the USA (Washington state), reported above. The 1st is paralytic shellfish poisoning and the 2nd, tick paralysis.Shellfish poisoning can occur after eating clams, mussels, oysters, scallops, cockles, starfish, and crustaceans that consume dinoflagellates during a red tide. During a red tide, sea waters turn a reddish color because large numbers of red organisms (dinoflagellates) are present. Dinoflagellates kill fish and other organisms by releasing toxins (poisonous substances). Consequently, shellfish take in the concentrated saxitoxin, a poison that causes paralysis.Red tides are most common in the cold waters of North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Japan. A red tide rarely occurs in warmer climates. People are poisoned when they unknowingly eat shellfish contaminated during a red tide with saxitoxins.Shellfish that is contaminated during a red tide does not have an abnormal taste, smell, or color, and the toxin is not destroyed by heating or cooking. (Excerpted from <http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/wilderness-shellfish-poisoning-paralysis>)The 2nd, tick paralysis, is often misdiagnosed -- with potentially dire consequences -- as one of the other diseases that cause an acute ascending paralysis with preserved mental status.The arthropod-inflicted paralysis is most often confused with Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome. Other causes of an acute ascending paralysis with preserved mental status include spinal cord tumors and acute poliomyelitis. Botulism, in contrast, causes a descending paralysis with preserved mental status, said Dr Sean O'Leary of the Children's Hospital and the University of Colorado in Denver.Conducting a thorough search for an embedded tick is essential in a patient with an acute ascending paralysis with preserved sensorium, particularly when there is a history consistent with potential tick exposure. Treatment of tick paralysis is simple: remove the tick. Clinical improvement will follow within hours.In unrecognized and untreated cases of tick paralysis, however, the fatality rate is about 10 percent, with death typically occurring just 18-30 hours after symptom onset, according to Dr O'Leary.Tick paralysis is more common in children than adults. The highest-risk group is young girls with long hair that can hide an engorged tick that has had a blood meal. At 3 days after attachment, the tick (usually a female) begins secreting the neurotoxin that causes the paralysis. Symptoms appear 4-7 days after attachment. The peak time for tick paralysis is tick mating season: April through June.The clinical scenario typically begins with loss of appetite and voice, followed by gait instability, ascending flaccid paralysis, excessive salivation, eye irritation, pupillary asymmetry, and vomiting. Death is usually from respiratory failure. For more than half a century, there have been postmortem reports of ticks being found embedded in the skin of people who died suddenly of unexplained paralytic illnesses.About 8 percent of the 870 named tick species have been associated with intoxication syndromes. The species that cause the most cases of human, dog, and livestock paralysis in North America are _Dermacentor andersoni_ and _D. variabilis_, both of which are vectors for the rickettsial disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In the United States, tick paralysis occurs most often in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain states.The tick toxin's pathogenic mechanism isn't fully understood. Australian investigators have reported that the toxin inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular synapse, but tick paralysis there is caused by _Ixodes_ species, and it's not clear that the same mechanism is at work in the paralysis caused by _Dermacentor_ species, Dr O'Leary said. (Excerpted from <https://www.acep.org/Clinical---Practice-Management/Misdiagnosing-Tick-Paralysis-Can-Lead-to-Death/>)While these 2 causes of AFM are important for physicians to bear in mind when they see patients presenting with AFM, the increase in AFM across the US is more likely due to infectious causes because of the number of states affected. From August 2014 to July 2015, the CDC verified 120 reports of children in 34 states who developed AFM, and that does not include individuals over the age of 22. Any additional information on possible etiologic agents would be welcome.A map of the United States can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>. - Mod LK][See Also:Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (05): USA 20161030.4596196Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (04): USA 20161030.4596196Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (03): USA 20161008.4545994Acute flaccid myelitis - North America (02): USA, Canada, human enterovirus D68 20161002.4530332Acute flaccid myelitis - North America: USA, human enterovirus D68 susp 20160923.4509548Human enterovirus D68 - Netherlands: acute flaccid myelitis 20160925.4513491Acute flaccid myelitis - USA: human enterovirus D68 susp 20160923.4509548Human enterovirus D68 - Taiwan, Canada: acute flaccid paralysis 20160902.4461647Human enterovirus D68 - USA (CO) acute flaccid paralysis 20160728.43759802015----Acute flaccid myelitis - USA: human enterovirus C105 susp 20150707.34927712014----Human enterovirus D68 - North America (19): acute flaccid myelitis assoc. 20141203.3009452Human enterovirus D68 - Europe (02): France, acute flaccid paralysis 20141106.2935270].................................................lk/mj/ml"
