The call, Kondravy said, was for ""a beautiful white cat ... with a bloody wound on her side.""The cat was snared and taken back to ORCA's headquarters at 401 E. Orange St. for treatment. Two veterinarians were consulted at different times that day, Kondravy said, neither of whom thought rabies was a concern. [Rabies can be difficult to diagnose, and it depends upon the situation and the presentation of the animal. - Mod.TG].But the cat showed signs of illness, 1st panting heavily and later lunging at another ORCA employee, Kondravy said. [The way this is worded, seems like a bit of time has passed since the paragraph above. Also, recall this animal was injured, therefore likely it was afraid, and lunging may be a fear reaction. - Mod.TG] By 26 Aug 2016, Kondravy said, ""she was terrible.""After the cat tried to escape through an open window and tried to attack an employee, Kondravy made the decision to euthanize the cat and have it tested for rabies. The test came back positive on Tuesday [30 Aug 2016], she said. [The behavior of the cat, trying to escape and then to attack, would seem like a neurological disease, with rabies at the top of the differential list. - Mod.TG]Although the cat was always handled with heavy gloves in the office, Kondravy said, the employee who trapped the cat could have been exposed and ""absolutely has to have the shots,"" according to the state Department of Health.The cat was white, a young adult female, possibly part Siamese, with one blue eye and one green, Kondravy said. She's not certain whether it was a feral cat, a stray or a housecat that was allowed to roam outside.Anyone who was bitten or scratched by the animal should contact the state Department of Health or call ORCA at 397-8922, Kondravy said.""I'm especially worried about children who were in the area, who might have played with the cat,"" she said. A child who got scratched might not think about or tell his or her parents about it, she added.Kondravy said there's no way to tell, based on the cat's injury, how it was infected.""It could have been another cat; it could have been a vector rabies species like a raccoon, a groundhog or a fox, maybe a skunk. I don't think it was a bat; it [the wound] wouldn't look like that,"" she said. ""But it could be feral cats infecting other feral cats. That's what's so terrifying,"" Kondravy added. ""All these cats out there ... and the problem is getting worse.""In April 2016, the state Department of Agriculture announced the discovery of 9 rabid animals in the mid-state area, including 4 in Lancaster County.The cases then involved 5 raccoons, a fox, a bat and 2 cats. Humans were exposed in one raccoon case in Lancaster County.[Byline: Tom Knapp]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Pennsylvania - feline, human exposureDate: 7 Sep 2016Source: Penn Live [edited]<http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/09/woman_to_undergo_rabies_shots.html>A Lancaster County woman reportedly has to undergo rabies vaccination after she reportedly took in a feral cat.This is the 2nd cat with rabies found in western Lancaster County in recent weeks, Lancaster Online reports. A rabid raccoon was also found, said the report.Mount Joy Borough police shot the cat suspected of having rabies that the woman came in contact with, and cautioned the public regarding feral cats or other animals acting out of the ordinary.Anyone who is scratched by a suspected rabid animal should call the state Department of Health or the Organization for Responsible Care of Animals at 717-397-8922.[Byline: Barbara Miller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] North Carolina - fox, human exposureDate: 7 Sep 2016Source: WCTI 12 [edited]<http://www.wcti12.com/news/fox-that-attacked-5-year-old-tests-positive-for-rabies/74217751>The fox that attacked a 5-year-old girl in Trent Woods has tested positive for rabies.Trent Woods Police Chief Tony Lee said it happened on 4 Sep 2016 on Darby Road. That road is behind Bangert Elementary School. Witnesses said the girl was playing in the backyard of her grandparents' house when the fox approached and bit her without provocation.The fox was killed by one of the homeowners and was sent to a state lab, where it tested positive for rabies. The girl was taken to Carolina East Medical Center where she received medical treatment and rabies vaccinations.The Trent Woods Police Department is asking anyone who sees a wild animal displaying unusual behavior to contact them.[Byline: Rachel Huber]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Massachusetts - fox, human exposureDate: 8 Sep 2016Source: Item Live [edited]<http://www.itemlive.com/news/rabid-fox-is-on-the-run-in-peabody/>The Board of Health is urging residents to use caution after a rabid fox bit at least one person earlier this week.The fox, which bit a person on Johnson Street on Monday [5 Sep 2016], tested positive for rabies, according to Sharon Cameron, the city's health director. A 2nd, unrelated person in the same neighborhood also reported being attacked by a fox on Monday.""Although it is likely that both incidents involved the same fox, we cannot be certain,"" said Cameron.The fox that attacked the person on Johnson Street was killed by the animal control officer. Since it is unknown whether the same animal was involved in the 2nd incident, Cameron said the city is urging an abundance of caution and has alerted residents about steps to minimize exposure to rabies.Rabies is a serious disease that affects the brain and spinal cord of mammals and almost always causes death without prompt treatment, according to the community alert. Rabies is usually a disease of animals but can spread from an infected animal to a person. The disease spreads when an animal with rabies bites another animal or person. Infected animals can also spread rabies if their saliva gets into a scratch or wound, or the eyes, nose or mouth of another person or animal.To prevent rabies exposure, the health board recommends never approaching an animal you don't know and reporting an animal that behaves oddly to the local Peabody, Massachusetts animal control officer. It is also recommended not to keep animals as wild pets and make sure your domesticated pets are vaccinated against rabies. Other tips include not feeding your pets outside, keeping pets in a fenced yard or on a leash, and keeping garbage securely covered and chimneys capped.If someone is bitten or scratched by an animal, they should wash the wound with soap and water immediately for 10 minutes and then call their doctor, veterinarian or local board of health. There is an effective treatment for rabies as long as it starts before the person or animal starts to get sick, according to the board of health notice.[Byline: Adam Swift]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] Connecticut - violation of rabies lawDate: 7 Sep 2016Source: WHDH [edited]<http://whdh.com/news/police-animal-shelter-director-forged-rabies-certificate/>The director of a Connecticut animal shelter has been charged with forging a rabies certificate.The Meriden Police Department says Ms D turned herself in on Wednesday [7 Sep 2016]. She is charged with forgery in the 2nd degree.Police launched an investigation in April 2015 after allegations of misconduct were made against Ms. DMs. D is the director of the Meriden Humane Society. Police say Ms. D forged the rabies vaccination certificate before the animal was adopted by a person who believed the animal had been vaccinated.It's not clear whether the director has a lawyer. She was released on a promise to appear in court on 20 Sep 2016.A call left for the Meriden Humane Society wasn't immediately returned on Wed 7 Sep 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Forgery of a rabies certificate is a serious complaint. This article does not tell us whether the forged certificate was for an animal with a known previous vaccination, or whether it was a stray or an owner-surrendered animal. While there may be a possible reason for her actions, it is a violation of most states' rabies laws. It also clearly implies the animal has been vaccinated and is, therefore, protected against the rabies virus. This may not be true and may put both the animal and the new owner in jeopardy should a rabid animal encounter the newly adopted animal. Clearly, from the above articles in this posting, that situation could occur anywhere at any time.Vaccination against rabies is the single most effective measure at starting to break a rabies cycle in the area. It is also the single best assurance and protection for a pet and their family.In any of these situations, a local rabies drive to get more pets vaccinated and to increase awareness among the public is in order. Yet those recommendations seemed very few.Rabies is a fatal disease in animals. While in people we can provide post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), it can be expensive, despite being necessary. Furthermore, as some articles noted, a child may not think to tell the parent/guardian of a scratch, and the time frame for PEP can pass. Very few human beings have survived rabies, and those that have generally have serious and lifelong problems. Please vaccinate your animals. - Mod.TGHealthMaps:Pennsylvania: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/240>North Carolina: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/235>Massachusetts: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/224>Connecticut: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/210>]
