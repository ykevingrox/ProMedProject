Regional epidemiologists contacted the organizers, the hotel where athletes were staying, local outpatient clinics/emergency teams and both hospitals nearby.   The organizers of the Biathlon World Cup in Slovenia were not aware of any communicable diseases affecting biathlon teams during the cup. One of the athletes was admitted to the hospital but the reason for the admission was non-infectious. Another athlete lost consciousness during the competition. Neither emergency medical teams nor nearby hospitals were contacted for any health intervention except for the above-mentioned situations. The hotel where the teams were staying was not informed about any gastrointestinal problems among its guests during the competition. The findings of our investigation do not preclude that some of the athletes had health problems during the competition but apparently not severe enough to contact local health services. We assume that if high numbers of athletes had become ill with gastrointestinal problems the organizer would have been informed. According to the national algorithm for mass gatherings (with emphasis on the international ones), the National Institute of Public Health is obligated to provide in advance the information to the organizers about possible health issues during mass gatherings and measures which must be taken to stop the spread of communicable diseases or at least to mitigate the outbreak. To conclude, we were not able to identify an outbreak of acute gastrointestinal or respiratory infection among competing athletes during the Biathlon World Cup in Pokljuka, Slovenia. --Maja Socan, M.D.Senior consultantCommunicable Diseases CentreNational Institute of Public HealthLjubljana, Slovenia<Maja.Socan@nijz.si>[ProMED thanks Dr. Socan for the thorough investigation into this report and for sharing the information with the ProMED community.
