Hindustan Times [summ., edited]<http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/shimla-battles-worst-jaundice-outbreak-since-1947/story-I3LhFdiCO0TjuYGaYXs8sK.html>People allege civic authorities waited a week to suspend drinking water supply from Ashwani Khud that was found to be contaminated with the hepatitis E virus, which caused the outbreak. By then, 25 percent of Shimla's population was affected. More than 2 months after the 1st cases of jaundice were reported in the 3rd week of December 2015, Shimla continues to grapple with the state's biggest jaundice outbreak since Independence [1947].Official data show 10 people have died and 1600 developed jaundice, but unofficial estimates put the number higher -- at over 10 000. ""The health department is clueless. It did not carry out a door-to-door survey to assess the magnitude of the outbreak,"" said Rakesh Bhardwaj, state surveillance officer.Nothing was done until 2 people died of jaundice in the 1st week of January 2016, after which Deputy Tikender Singh Panwar lodged an FIR [First Information Report] against 'unknown' people for water contamination. After the registration of the FIR, a probe by a special investigation team headed by an ASP [Assistant Superintendent of Police]-rank officer led to the arrest of 10 people, including 6 officials of the irrigation and public health (IPH) department and the contractor running the sewerage plant that contaminated drinking water supply.Dr Ramesh Chand, senior medical superintendent of Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC), Shimla, said the hospital had witnessed the maximum number of patients per day in mid-January 2016. ""Initially, there were fewer cases each day. In the middle of January, 60-70 cases of jaundice were witnessed in hospitals daily,"" said Dr Chand. He added, ""Now, the number has reduced to around 10.""[Byline: Gaurva Bisht]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1547>.
