The series of articles, in a special supplement to CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), comes on the 2nd anniversary of the official activation of the CDC's emergency response to Ebola.The primary focus of the new MMWR Ebola special supplement primarily focuses on the CDC's work during the 1st [18 months] of the response. The CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for the Ebola response on [9 Jul 2014]. On [5 Aug 2014], the CDC elevated the EOC to a Level 1 activation, its highest level. On [31 Mar 2016], the CDC officially deactivated the EOC for the 2014-2016 Ebola response.][Citation for this very comprehensive summary of the response to Ebola in W. Africa: MMWR.

CrossMark doi: 10.1073/pnas.1600299113.Abstract.Vaccines have had broad medical impact, but existing vaccine technologies and production methods are limited in their ability to respond rapidly to evolving and emerging pathogens, or sudden outbreaks. Here, we develop a rapid-response, fully synthetic, single-dose, adjuvant-free dendrimer nanoparticle vaccine platform wherein antigens are encoded by encapsulated mRNA replicons. To our knowledge, this system is the 1st capable of generating protective immunity against a broad spectrum of lethal pathogen challenges, including H1N1 influenza, _Toxoplasma gondii_, and Ebola virus. The vaccine can be formed with multiple antigen-expressing replicons and is capable of eliciting both CD8+ T-cell and antibody responses. The ability to generate viable, contaminant-free vaccines within days, to single or multiple antigens, may have broad utility for a range of diseases.5 Jul 2016 Liberia: PREVAIL [Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia] treatment trial for men with persistent Ebola viral RNA in semen opens in Liberia<http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-07/nioa-ptt070516.php>[The Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL), a U.S.-Liberia joint Clinical Research Partnership, today [5 Jul 2016] announced the opening of PREVAIL IV, a treatment trial for men who have survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) but continue to have evidence of Ebola virus genetic material, RNA, in their semen. The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, in partnership with the Ministry of Health of Liberia and the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. The 6-month study will enroll 60 to 120 EVD survivors whose semen has evidence of Ebola virus RNA prior to their enrollment. Participants in the double-blind trial will receive either investigational drug GS-5734, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, Inc., or a placebo. ...- moreNIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. [said] ""The goal of the PREVAIL IV trial is to see if the experimental drug can eliminate the traces of Ebola virus from semen in men who have survived Ebola infection. It is anticipated that this would decrease the risk of passing the virus to their sexual partners. If so, the drug would be another weapon in our arsenal against Ebola virus disease.""][For more information on GS-5734, see Warren T.K., Jordan R., Lo M.K., et al. (2 Mar 2016).

(7 July 2016). Effectiveness of Four Disinfectants against Ebola Virus on Different Materials. Viruses 2016, 8(7), 185. doi:10.3390/v8070185 (registering DOI) file:///C:/Users/ldk02/Downloads/viruses-08-00185.pdfAbstract.The West Africa Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak has highlighted the need for effective disinfectants capable of reducing viral load in a range of sample types, equipment and settings. Although chlorine-based products are widely used, they can also be damaging to equipment or apparatus that needs continuous use such as aircraft use for transportation of infected people. Two aircraft cleaning solutions were assessed alongside 2 common laboratory disinfectants in a contact kill assay with EBOV on 2 aircraft relevant materials representative of a porous and non-porous surface. A decimal log reduction of viral titre of 4 is required for a disinfectant to be deemed effective, and 2 of the disinfectants fulfilled this criteria under the conditions tested. One product, Ardrox 6092, was found to perform similarly to sodium hypochlorite, but as it does not have the corrosive properties of sodium hypochlorite, it could be an alternative disinfectant solution to be used for decontamination of EBOV on sensitive apparatus.][Personnel responding to the Ebola outbreak were reliant on personal protective equipment and disinfection for effective infection control. Surfaces that became contaminated also needed to be disinfected. Chlorine-based compounds are generally effective against EBOV, along with the other filoviruses, because they have a lipid envelope, but the compounds can also be very corrosive. For this reason, it was important to conduct a comparison of disinfectants for effectiveness without damage. - Mod.LKFunding-----3 Jul 2016 Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal: World Bank Gives USD 110 million to improved disease surveillance<http://allafrica.com/stories/201607041211.html>[According to a World Bank press release, 33.3 million people living in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Senegal are expected to benefit from stronger health systems due to the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement Program (REDISSE).
