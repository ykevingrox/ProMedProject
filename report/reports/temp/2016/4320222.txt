Food Poisoning Bulletin [edited]<https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2016/legionnaires-outbreak-at-meadowbrook-inn-3-sickened/>The source of a legionnaires' disease outbreak that has infected 3 guests at Meadowbrook Inn & Suites in Blowing Rock, North Carolina has not yet been identified, according to the Appalachian District Health Department (AppHealthCare). The health department has released a public health advisory to alert visitors to the mountain resort community about this recent outbreak.According to this advisory, the 3 victims all visited the 62-room hotel, located one block from central Blowing Rock, between [15 Apr and 15 Jun 2016]. Each had stayed at the hotel within the 2- to 10-day incubation period in which _Legionella_ bacteria, once inhaled or aspirated into one's body, develops into full-blown legionnaires' disease. All three people were hospitalized, treated, and are now recovering.Management of the Meadowbrook Inn and Suites was notified by AppHealthCare on [13 Jun 21016] that 3 of their guests had contracted the potentially fatal illness. Initial in-house testing of the hotel's hot tub for _Legionella_ bacteria produced negative results; additional environmental samples have been sent to a specialized lab for further testing. Results are forthcoming.In response to the outbreak, Meadowbrook Inn immediately notified all guests who had stayed at the hotel between [15 Apr and 15 Jun 2016]. They have also set up a hotline to address questions concerning the outbreak. The hotline number is: (828) 295-4301, ext. 804.AppHealthCare, in addition to warning the public of the possible exposure of Meadowbrook Inn's guests and employees to the _Legionella_ pneumonia bacteria, also recommends to clinicians that they consider testing patients for legionnaires' disease if they, from [15 Apr 2016] through the current date, present with a ""clinically compatible illness"" such as pneumonia. Tests for legionnaires' disease include a _Legionella_ urinary antigen test and a culture of lower respiratory secretions on selective media. Should such tests reveal that the patients have contracted legionellosis, these samples will be compared to environmental samples from potential sources of the exposure (such as the Meadowbrook Inn) in order to see if there is a common strain found both at an environmental source and in a patient.Within hotel environments, common sources of _Legionella_ contamination include hot tub/spas, cooling towers, and heating/cooling systems. The bacteria can also proliferate in and be spread by the vapor rising from architectural water features like fountains.The initial symptoms of legionnaires' disease -- high fever cough, shortness of breath, confusion, headaches, diarrhea, nausea, and/or muscle aches -- can swiftly develop into a severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Once contracted, legionnaires' disease is particularly dangerous for people over 50, smokers, those with respiratory illness, cancer, diabetes, or HIV, and those with compromised/weakened immune systems.[Byline: Kari Diehl]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Blowing Rock, with a population of 1241 in 2010, is a town in Watauga and Caldwell counties in the US state of North Carolina; tourism is Blowing Rock's main industry (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_Rock,_North_Carolina#Attractions>).
