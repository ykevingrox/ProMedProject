Uganda Radio Network [edited]<http://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/rift-valley-fever-government-sets-up-national-task-force>The Ministry of Health has set up a multi-sectorial national taskforce to coordinate all efforts to control and manage the outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Kabale district.The task force is comprised of officials from the Ministry of Health, Agriculture, Water and Environment and Uganda Wildlife Authority-UWA. It is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control (CDC).The development follows the confirmation of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever, a viral infection that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Up to 5 cases have so far been confirmed in Kabale district over the last 3 days.The virus, characterized by fever, severe illness and abortions, is transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering, conducting veterinary procedures or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses, according to the WHO. The majority of human infections result from contact with blood or organs of infected animals and persons.Dr Ruth Aceng, the Director General Health Services, says the task force will conduct research, surveillance training of health workers in case management and conduct social mobilization on mechanism to contain the virus. Aceng adds that 3 more people have been reported to have signs of the disease, bringing the number to 5 since it was reported 4 days ago. Dr Nicholas Kawuta, the Director of Animal Resources at the Ministry of Agriculture, says the Rift Valley fever outbreak had been expected at the onset of El NiÌ±o rains. He however adds that the government has started working with the World Bank to vaccinate animals in Kabale and surrounding districts.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is good to see that a multi-sectorial task force involving public health, animal health and wildlife has been assembled and has begun to investigate this outbreak. It would be helpful to know if the domestic animals in the area, especially small ruminants, have been vaccinated against Rift Valley fever. - Mod.TY]******[2]Date: Tue 15 Mar 2016Source: New Vision [edited]<http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1419671/diagnosed-rift-valley-fever-kabale>Two diagnosed with Rift Valley fever in Kabale----------------------------------------------The Ministry of Health has instituted a task force to combat an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Kabale district.This comes after 2 people in Kabale town council were diagnosed with the disease and referred to Kabale Regional Referral Hospital for treatment while 3 other cases have so far been identified in the same area.Dr. Ruth Aceng, the director general of health services in the ministry, said the task force is comprised of experts from the ministries of health, agriculture and animal husbandry in addition to the Uganda Wildlife authority.""The multi-sectorial task force has boosted surveillance programs in Kabale, Rwanda and DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] borders. So far a total of 59 animal and 11 human samples have been collected for testing at the Uganda Virus Research Institute,"" Aceng said.Aceng noted that the disease is an acute fever that is transmitted by mosquitoes during the rainy season and affects animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and buffaloes.The disease presents symptoms of fever, general weakness, back pain, dizziness and weight loss at the onset of the illness.""We urge the general public to report any suspected patient or sick animal to a nearby health facility or veterinary clinic respectively,"" Aceng added.Dr. Kawuta Nicholas, who is in charge of animal resources in the ministry of agriculture, noted that the ministry will not consider the quarantine of animals in the district until they find enough evidence to show that the outbreak is linked to animals.[Byline: Joyce Nyakato]--Communicated by: ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Tue 15 Mar 2016Source: Uganda Radio Network [edited]<http://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/another-rift-valley-fever-suspect-isolated-at-kabale-hospital->Another Rift Valley Fever Suspect Isolated at Kabale Hospital-------------------------------------------------------------Another suspected victim of the Rift Valley fever has been admitted at Kabale Regional Referral Hospital, barely few days it was confirmed in Kabale District. Dr. Patrick Tusiime, the Kabale District Medical Officer, says the suspect is a long distance truck driver.  According to Dr. Tusiime, the suspect was admitted in the isolation unit at Kabale Referral Hospital when he presented with signs of Rift Valley fever. He says samples from the suspected Rift Valley fever victim have been dispatched to Uganda Virus Research institute Entebbe for verification. Once the tests turn out positive, this will be the 3rd case that has been recorded in Kabale district. Dr. Tusiime says in an attempt to contain the spread of the fever, they have called off all blood donation drives by Uganda Red Cross Society in the district until further notice. He says information gathered by the surveillance team shows that a number of people succumbed to the fever over the last 2 weeks before the outbreak was confirmed on [11 Mar 2016]. Rift Valley fever is a viral infection that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. It presents with fever, severe illness and abortions in animals. According to World Health Organization, the fever is transmitted to humans through poor handling of animal tissue during slaughtering, veterinary procedures or disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Majority of human infections result from contact with blood or organs of infected animals and persons.

It has also been reported from Senegal and Mauritania in the western part of the African continent, as well as in the Arabian peninsula (see Nanyingi, M., Munyua, P., Kiama, S., Muchemi, G., Thumbi, S., Bitek, A., Bett, B., Muriithi, R., & Njenga, M. (2015). A systematic review of Rift Valley Fever epidemiology 1931-2014. Infection Ecology & Epidemiology, 5. doi: <http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/iee.v5.28024>, with an excellent map showing the distribution of reported outbreaks of available at: <http://www.infectionecologyandepidemiology.net/index.php/iee/article/viewFile/28024/html_15/167731>).Addressing that void in reported cases, Magona et al. did a serosurvey of goats and mosquito vectors in Uganda demonstrating the seroprevalence of RVF in domestic goats in Uganda.Abstract""Increasing occurrence of outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been reported in Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Sudan, Madagascar and South Africa during heavy and prolonged, often unseasonal, rainfall from 1997 to 2009. Given Uganda's location in the endemic zone of RVF, surveys were conducted on goat farms with a view to establishing presence of RVF virus and existence of its mosquito vectors. A total of 1470 sera were tested using the IgG ELISA and subsequently 700 sera tested using the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) and a species identification survey for mosquitoes undertaken. The findings revealed an overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF virus IgG of 9.8 percent (95 percent CI, 8.5-11.1 percent). VNT revealed a seroprevalence of 24.3 percent (95 percent CI, 21.1-27.5 percent). The following specific farms had a higher likelihood to have seropositive goats: Lubega (OR 3.5 (1.1-11.3)), Katabarwa (OR 6.4 (2.0-20.5)) and Maduwa (OR 5.3 (1.6-16.7)). Mubende goats were 4 times (OR 4.2 (1.3-13.5)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than Boer goats, and adult goats were 2 times (OR 2.2 (1.5-3.3)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than young ones. Mosquito species found, included, _Anopheles gambiae_ (71.2 percent), _Culex_ sp. (21.5 percent), _Anopheles funestus_ (6.5 percent), _Aedes_ sp. (0.7 percent) and _Mansonia_ sp. (0.2 percent). High prevalence of anti-RVFV IgG in goats in some locations together with presence of RVF virus neutralizing antibodies (up to 1:80) suggested that the RVF virus is endemic in goats in Uganda. Presence of RVF virus coupled with existence of Aedes sp. and Culex sp. mosquito vectors are likely to lead to RVF outbreaks once the mosquito population flares-up due to flooding and increased RVF virus amplification occurs.""

Small Ruminant Research. 2013;114(1):176-181.)Interestingly, the one prior report of suspected RVF in Uganda published on ProMED-mail (alas, which was never confirmed) mentions that it was a year that ""Uganda is experiencing a serious blood shortage as a result of El NiÌ±o-induced epidemics of malaria and other fevers that have spread to all areas of the country since last November [1997].""Oftentimes outbreaks of RVF in humans have served as sentinel events alerting the livestock personnel of ongoing outbreaks in livestock. It appears as though this may be the case in this current outbreak in Uganda.More information on the findings of investigations of this outbreak in both humans as well as livestock in Uganda would be greatly appreciated.Note that the previous posting on Rift Valley fever in Uganda mentioned the cases were from Kibaale District, whereas these newly confirmed cases are from Kabale district.  Clarification of the geographic extent of this outbreak would be greatly appreciated.
