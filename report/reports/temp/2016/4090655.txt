Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), United States Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security [edited]<https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=19253>The US Embassy wishes to inform US citizens about one confirmed and one suspected case of Lassa fever in northern Togo. This message is for informational purposes only.Lassa fever is a rare but potentially life-threatening viral hemorrhagic disease. The risk of contamination is low, but can occur if someone comes into contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids. Lassa fever cannot be spread through casual contact, including skin to skin contact, without exchange of bodily fluids. Those at highest-risk would be health care workers treating patients in facilities known to have Lassa fever and family members caring for infected patients.Early diagnosis and supportive care are essential. You should consult a medical professional if you have been in direct contact with an infected person within the past 3 weeks and have symptoms of Lassa fever, which include: fever, chest, stomach or back pain, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, or mucosal bleeding.

""We've shown that we can handle Ebola and this [Lassa fever] is a lot less communicable.""Lassa fever has been endemic in Africa for many years, with up to 300 000 infections annually. Only about 3 percent presenting symptoms severe enough need hospitalization, Ribner said.Of those hospitalized, about 20 percent of the cases are fatal, compared with a 70 percent rate for all patients who catch Ebola [virus disease], which is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids.""With Lassa [fever], most of the people who get it never even know it,"" Ribner said.The worst Ebola [virus disease] outbreak in recorded history began in West Africa in December 2013, spreading to at least 11 countries on the continent before petering out. In all, more than 11 300 people died, almost all in the 3 worst-affected countries. At its height, the Ebola outbreak sparked fear around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take emergency precautions.An outbreak of Lassa fever is now underway in Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization, and it is starting to spread to nearby countries, including Togo.According to a WHO statement, 159 suspected cases of Lassa fever and 82 deaths were reported between August 2015 and January 2016. Some media reports have said as many as 101 people have died as of February [2016].Like Ebola, Lassa causes a severe fever with bleeding, Ribner said. It is most commonly transmitted to people from rodent excrement, and it can be transmitted from person to person by contact with blood or bodily fluids, Ribner said.He said the hospital will take every precaution and that the public should not be alarmed.""You can't catch it like you get the common cold,"" he said. ""We can handle this.""The disease [virus] is carried by the _Mastomys natalensis_ rodent [African soft-furred rat or Natal multimammate rat or mouse], found across sub-Saharan Africa, and often eaten as a source of protein. Lassa fever virus infects an estimated 300 000-500 000 people each year, and kills about 5000.[Byline: Rich McKay, Editing By Frank McGurty, Bernard Orr]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[3] Nigeria, Bauchi state: new casesDate: Fri 11 Mar 2016Source: Vanguard [edited]<http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/03/3-dead-10-infected-in-fresh-bauchi-lassa-fever-outbreak/>No fewer than 3 persons have died from a fresh outbreak of Lassa fever, while 10 members of a family are currently infected with the virus in Bauchi State.The Executive Chairman Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Ibrahim Gamawa, who said this yesterday [10 Mar 2016] in Bauchi, added that the 10 new cases were recorded in a single family at Jaye village in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area of the state. He said the outbreak started after a 78-year-old man died of the disease without seeking professional medical treatment.Gamawa said: ""Investigations revealed that the deceased contracted the virus from Liman Katagum [Bauchi], where some cases of Lassa Fever were found in November last year [2015]. ""The victim was put on traditional treatment from patent medicine stores for a number of days before he died.Another 10 persons contacted the virus and samples of their blood were taken to Irrua laboratory in Edo State, where they were confirmed positive. They are now on admission at the state isolation centre of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching hospital, Bauchi."" Meanwhile, Governor Mohammed Abubakar has approved the construction of infectious diseases centre in Bayara Hospital in Bauchi, where cases of infectious diseases will be treated, while Federal Government will assist with equipping the hospital with facilities.[Byline: Suzan Edeh]Read more at <http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/03/3-dead-10-infected-in-fresh-bauchi-lassa-fever-outbreak/>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[New cases appear in new locations.

One wonders if conditions are more favorable for the _Mastomys_ rodent reservoir populations with increased prevalence of Lassa virus infections in these rodents, with resulting grater human exposure.Virus transmission can occur in houses, in hospital environments, or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. Nosocomial infections can occur in health care centers if barrier nursing practices and use of personal protective equipment are not implemented. Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>. - Mod.TY]
