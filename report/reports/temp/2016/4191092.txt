The victim, who became the 2nd patient to have died in the city [Karachi] of Congo fever this year [2016], was a resident of Chaman town, Balochistan.[The patient] was brought to AKUH on [21 Apr 2016] with internal and external bleeding. He was diagnosed by doctors to have been infected by the deathly virus, informed an official of the provincial health department, Zafar Mehdi.The health official brushed off media reports claiming the man was from Karachi; he said a relative of the deceased resided in Saddar but the man himself hailed from Balochistan.The office of the Karachi director of health had confirmed his death, which occurred on [Mon 25 Apr 2016], however, the AKUH informed the health authorities of the death on [Tue 26 Apr 2016].He claimed the virus was not a threat in Karachi as proper measures to contain it had been adopted by the authorities.The viral disease is caused by a tick (a parasitic arachnid) as it attaches itself with the skin of an animal mainly livestock and transmits it to humans.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The report incorrectly quotes the 'tick' as the cause of CCHF; in fact the disease is caused by a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.What is vital in both reports above is that strict infection prevention and control measures be taken at healthcare facilities that receive or are likely to receive suspected CCHF cases, as well as regular training of healthcare staff in this regard. - Mod.UBAMaps of Pakistan can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.
