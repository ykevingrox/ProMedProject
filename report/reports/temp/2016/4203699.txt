Wisconsin Department of Health Services [edited]<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/elizabethkingia.htm>Wisconsin 2016 _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ outbreak---------------------------------------------------The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), Division of Public Health (DPH) is currently investigating an outbreak of bacterial infections caused by _Elizabethkingia anophelis_. The majority of patients acquiring these infections are over 65 years old, and all patients have a history of at least one underlying serious illness.The Department quickly identified effective antimicrobial treatment for _E. anophelis_, and has alerted health care providers, infection preventionists and laboratories statewide. Since the initial guidance was sent on 15 Jan 2016, there has been a rapid identification of cases and healthcare providers have been able to treat and improve outcomes for patients. DHS continues to provide updates of outbreak-related information that includes laboratory testing, infection control, and treatment guidance.At this time, the source of these infections is still unknown, and the Department continues to work diligently to control this outbreak.Disease detectives from the Department and the CDC are conducting a comprehensive investigation which includes:- interviewing patients with _E. anophelis_ infection and/or their families to gather information about activities and exposures related to healthcare products, food, water, restaurants, and other community settings;- obtaining environmental and product samples from facilities that have treated patients with _E. anophelis_ infections. To date, these samples have tested negative and there is no indication the bacterium was spread by a single healthcare facility;- conducting a review of medical records;- obtaining nose and throat swabs from individuals receiving care on the same units in health care facilities as a patient with a confirmed _E. anophelis_ to determine if they are carrying the bacteria. To date, all of these specimens tested negative, which suggests the bacterium is not spreading from person to person in healthcare settings;- obtaining nose and throat swabs from household contacts of patients with confirmed cases to identify if there may have been exposure in their household environment;- performing a ""social network"" analysis to examine any commonalities shared between patients including healthcare facilities or shared locations or activities in the community.Wisconsin 2016 _E. anophelis_ outbreak:Case counts between 1 Nov 2015 and 3 May 2016---------------------------------------------Confirmed = 60Under investigation = 0Possible cases = 4Total cases reported to Wisconsin DPH = 64Affected counties include Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Washington, Waukesha, and Winnebago.There have been 18 deaths among individuals with confirmed _E. anophelis_ infections and an additional 1 death among possible cases for a total of 19 deaths. It has not been determined if these deaths were caused by the infection or other serious pre-existing health problems. Counties where these deaths occurred are: Columbia, Dodge, Fond du lac, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Washington, and Waukesha.This investigation is ongoing. Case counts may change as additional illnesses are identified and more cases are laboratory confirmed.The possible cases are cases that tested positive for _Elizabethkingia_, but will never be confirmed as the same strain of _E. anophelis_ because the outbreak specimens are no longer available to test.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/250>.

All of the 60 cases involved in the outbreak have been adults over 65 years of age.""The outbreak is caused by a very specific strain of _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ and so then it is easy once you get the CDC involved to be able to tell if you've got sort of a boring [the interviewee's word] _E. anophelis_ or the outbreak strain,"" Dr Peter Havens, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Children's Hospital, said at a [Tue 3 May 2016] press conference. ""We have the boring [the interviewee's word] strain of _E. anophelis_.""Havens said the child is doing ""quite well"" with an effective treatment of antimicrobials.The Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene did determine that one of the suspected cases of _Elizabethkingia_ submitted last week is related to the outbreak, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 60.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This week, there are no new reported cases in any of the 3 Midwestern states (Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan) that have reported infections with the outbreak strain of _E. anophelis_. No further epidemiological information is available. - Mod.LL]
