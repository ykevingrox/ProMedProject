He said this is one of 2 types of mosquitoes that can carry the Zika virus, but it doesn't mean the mosquito he spotted would transmit Zika.Humans who are bitten by a mosquito with the Zika virus may get sick with Zika fever or may show no symptoms at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The highest risk is for women who are pregnant.Asian tiger mosquitoes were brought to the United States years ago after [eggs] traveling inside of tires that were sent to the US from Asia, Ford said.About 40 people have been infected with Zika virus and reported it in Indiana, according to the state's Department of Health.However, the 40 victims were infected while traveling. The department states no Zika infections have been contracted locally.Ford said he doesn't expect any Asian tiger mosquitoes to find a home in Madison County, as they do not do well in cold winters.What is harder to keep at bay in Madison County is West Nile, which is a mosquito-borne virus. West Nile [virus] is common each year around Madison County, but the health department recently received official results that some mosquitoes captured in the county are carrying West Nile [virus], Ford said.Ford captures them with a gravitrap, a contraption with ""the foulest smell"" that attracts mosquitoes. Once the mosquitoes enter it, the gravitrap sucks them up, and Ford sends them off for testing. He received the results for this season's mosquitoes at the end of September [2016].There are precautions people can take to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Ford suggests wearing loose fitting clothing with sleeves, to make it harder for mosquitoes to bite the skin.[Byline: Devan Filchak]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Finding _Ae. albopictus_ in Madison County, in central Indiana, is not surprising. The area is well within the CDC's geographic distribution map (<http://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/range.html>). The mosquito has also been found in the neighboring state of Ohio (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20161001.4528980). With Florida as the only locality in the USA having local Zika virus transmission, it is extremely unlikely that this virus would appear in mosquitoes in Indiana. However, as of 19 Oct 2016, the CDC reported 39 imported cases of Zika virus infection in Indiana this year. There would have to be a significant _Ae. albopictus_ population present to initiate ongoing transmission. Indiana will be experiencing killing frosts, if they have not already occurred, that will bring mosquito activity to an end for this year. - Mod.TYThe state of Indiana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20885>.
