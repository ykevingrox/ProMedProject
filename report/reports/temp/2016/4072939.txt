In fact, work is going on there day and night, and it should be ready in 3 weeks time.""[Byline: Peter Okutu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Lassa fever reports are coming in from new locations this year (2016). The control campaign includes public education, but nothing explicit is mentioned about rodent control. Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
