The state commissioner for health, Dr Babatunde Ipaye, at a news conference on Sunday evening [14 Feb 2016], said the dead person was expected to complete her medication on Sunday before the death.""Ogun state government under the leadership of Sen Ibikunle Amosun announces regrettably the death of the 1st case of Lassa fever in Ogun state today [14 Feb 2016]. We have contacted the family and gotten necessary consents and approvals to bury the remains according to WHO guidelines and the national protocol.""She was admitted into the isolation unit of OSUTH [Ogun State University Teaching Hospital], which was specifically equipped, staffed and funded by the state government to manage confirmed cases of Lassa [fever] in the course of this national epidemic,"" Ipaye said.""Upon confirmation at a private hospital in Ota, she received the best medical attention from varying numbers of medical specialists, well trained nurses, volunteer medical officers, and several well kitted support staff. The patient has received a 9 day course of ribavirin, potent antibiotics, appropriate blood transfusions, and necessary psychosocial support.""We were only waiting to celebrate the completion of medication today [Sun 14 Feb 2016] and take a blood sample to confirm cure, when unexpected complication set in yesterday, [Sat 13 Feb 2016],"" he said.He also disclosed that the deceased relatives were contacted before burial, added that her father, who resides in Nasarawa state, was contacted alongside other relatives around here [Ogun state]. The commissioner however confirmed that none of the 121 primary contacts tracked with the 1st victim have shown any symptom suggestive of Lassa fever. He said the 1st 10 days have proved that, assuring that they will keep watching in the next 11 days to make up the longest incubation period of 21 days.On the 2nd case, which was discovered last [Thu 11 Feb 2016], the woman revealed that she had also traveled into Abeokuta from Kogi, in the north central part of the country. He [sic; presumably the health commissioner. - Mod.SH] however stated that the victim, whose identity was not revealed, is between 28-30 years and 12 weeks pregnant, and is responding to treatment as at this morning [14 Feb 2016] when he checked on her. ""Like the 1st case, she also traveled into Abeokuta from Kogi state. She was said to have traveled to Kogi, her husband's hometown for a ceremony. After the ceremony, she spent about 2 weeks in the state before returning [to Ogun state] to meet with her husband, who is a civil servant.""She was said to have gone to a primary health centre in Obantoko area from where she was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, FMC, Idi aba, Abeokuta. The FMC don't have facilities for isolation, so we were called upon.""[byline: Kehinde Akinyemi]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of Lassa fever cases and fatalities continues to climb in Nigeria this year (2016). There were 2 reported cases of Lassa fever in Kogi state last year (2015). The virus is endemic in Nigeria and cases occur every year.The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety. Unfortunately, nosocomial transmission is not unusual.Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. There has been no indication that a village-level control effort has been initiated yet.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
