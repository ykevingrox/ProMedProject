""There are already lists of individuals who have volunteered,"" Devane said. ""We wanted to make sure that list gets bigger.""--However, if there are no volunteers at any given time of need, the hospital is then allowed to assign employees.--Anyone who ends up being quarantined after providing care to a patient will continue to be paid during their quarantine.--Training for handling new pandemics will be ongoing, so any updated advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will quickly be conveyed to health care workers.--The USD 3000 tuition reimbursement available for every employee will be increased by USD 700, while those who use it will have to commit to remaining at the hospital another year.][It is good the contract has the foresight to plan for new pandemics rather than focus solely on EVD. - Mod.LK]27 Oct 2016 Sierra Leone: New report highlights fragile state of food security in Sierra Leone after Ebola outbreak<http://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/new-report-highlights-fragile-state-food-security-sierra-leone-after-ebola>The State of Food Insecurity in Sierra Leone report launched today [27 Oct 2016] by the Government of Sierra Leone, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows more than half of the population -- over 3.5 million people -- are food insecure, without access to a sufficient amount of safe and nutritious food. Of these, about 600 000 are severely food insecure, eating significantly less food and less varied and nutritious food, and unable to cope with new shocks such as drought, floods and fluctuating food prices. The number of severely food insecure people has increased by 60 percent since 2010. There are over 34 000 households across Sierra Leone's 149 chiefdoms and 18 urban wards, making it the largest food security assessment of its kind in the country. Out of 149 chiefdoms and 18 urban wards surveyed, 110 chiefdoms had food insecurity levels above the national average of 50 percent.""...more...Research------26 Oct 2016: Antibodies from Ebola survivors neutralize virus, protect against infection in lab<http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-antibodies-ebola-survivors-neutralize-virus.html>A study by scientists at the Emory Vaccine Center, in collaboration with the biotechnology company Atreca, Inc., has found that antibodies generated from the blood of survivors of Ebola virus disease can strongly neutralize the Ebola virus in the laboratory and protect mice from a lethal viral challenge.22 Sep 2016: A simple mathematical model for Ebola in Africa<http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17513758.2016.1229817>[Citation.Berge T, Lubuma JM, Moremedi GM, et al.

We develop an SIR-type model which, incorporates both the direct and indirect transmissions in such a manner that there is a provision of Ebola viruses. We prove that the full model has one (endemic) equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable whereas, it is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of the Ebola virus shedding in the environment. For the sub-model without the provision of Ebola viruses, the disease dies out or stabilizes globally at an endemic equilibrium. At the endemic level, the number of infections is larger for the full model than for the sub-model without provision of Ebola viruses. We design a nonstandard finite difference scheme, which preserves the dynamics of the model. Numerical simulations are provided. ...[more]8 Sep 2016: Trojan Horse antibody attacks Ebola type filoviruses into carrying the means of their own destruction.<https://www.dvidshub.net/news/212875/trojan-horse-antibody-attacks-ebola>[In a research effort funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Joint Science and Technology Office, researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Integrated BioTherapeutics Inc., Vanderbilt University Medical Center and The Scripps Research Institute discovered a new strategy for defeating all 5 strands of EBOV to protect war-fighters and civilians.""Often fatal, [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] is a disease with no FDA-approved vaccines or treatments. The situation is complicated by 5 viral strains, 4 of which cause harm to humans. However, research supported by 2 JSTO projects has created a novel medical countermeasure design.Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising treatments for EBOV patients, but most mAb therapies target individual strains of EBOV with limited effectiveness against the other strains. A research team, led by Dr. John Dye of USAMRIID, sought to discover an effective medical countermeasure for all EBOV strains. The team discovered the Achilles' heel of EBOV [Ebola virus]: It must bind to a host-cell protein called Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and multiply in human cells. This new therapeutic strategy targets the weakness shared by all EBOV types. One of the novel antibodies produced under this strategy protected mice against the 2 most lethal strains, Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan.The team deceived EBOV into carrying the means of its own destruction into cells by synthesizing 2 types of ""bispecific"" antibodies (bsAbs), each consisting of 2 mAbs combined into one molecule. One bsAb neutralized the viral protein that binds to NPC1 [Niemann-Pick disease, type C1], the other targeted NPC1. Both had one mAb in common, FVM09, which binds all EBOV while the virus is outside cells, allowing the bsAbs to ride the virus into the cell. Because the engineered bsAbs block endosomal receptor binding by all filoviruses, combining them with delivery mAbs of viral or cellular origin could afford coverage against all filoviruses, including emerging or engineered variants.Researcher Dr. Kartik Chandran hopes to extend the ""Trojan horse"" strategy beyond EBOV for increased warfighter protection. ""We hope that our 'Trojan horse' antibody strategy of targeting viruses in lysosomes might work against other disease-causing viruses like flu, dengue, or Lassa, which, like Ebola, also enter host-cell lysosomes as part of their life cycles. This breakthrough will increase protection for the warfighter against naturally occurring or engineered viruses.""][Seems like an innovative approach that shows some promise. - Mod.LK]27 Oct 2016: Preparation and response to the 2014 Ebola virus disease epidemic in Nigeria--The experience of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165271>[Citation.Ogoina D, Oyeyemi AS, Ayah O, et al.

PLOS-One <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165271>Abstract.---Introduction.The 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak elicited global attention and challenged health systems around the world, Nigeria inclusive. We hereby report the preparation and response to the outbreak by a tertiary teaching hospital in Bayelsa State, Nigeria.---ConclusionOur results suggest that fear, myth and misconceptions were common among HCWs [health care workers] during the outbreak. The EVD outbreak, however, helped to strengthen gaps in infection control and emergency preparedness in the hospital. Strategies to allay fear are required to contain future outbreaks of EVD in Nigeria hospitals.]26 Oct 2016: Quantifying the risk of nosocomial infection within Ebola Holding Units: a retrospective cohort study of negative patients discharged from 5 Ebola Holding Units in Western Area, Sierra Leone<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.12802/abstract;jsessionid=74649C83BAA4CCED1ED2196807B380FD.f04t04>[Citation.Arkel P, Youkee D, Brown CS, et al.

Quantifying the risk of nosocomial infection within Ebola Holding Units: a retrospective cohort study of negative patients discharged from 5 Ebola Holding Units in Western Area, Sierra Leone. Wiley Online Library. DOI: 10.1111/tmi.12802Abstract.---ObjectivesA central pillar in the response to the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra Leone was the role of Ebola Holding Units (EHUs). These units isolated patients meeting a suspect case definition, tested them for EVD, initiated appropriate early treatment, and discharged negative patients to onward inpatient care or home. Positive patients were referred to Ebola Treatment Centers. We aimed to estimate the risk of nosocomial transmission within these EHUs.---ResultsWe found a positive readmission rate of 3.3 percent (18 cases), which included 1.5 percent confirmed readmissions (8 cases) and 1.8 percent possible readmissions (10 cases). This is lower than rates previously reported. We cannot ascertain whether EVD was acquired within the EHUs or from re-exposure in the community. No demographic or clinical variables were identified as risk factors for positive readmission, likely due to our small sample size.---ConclusionsThese findings support the EHU model as a safe method for isolation of suspect EVD patients and their role in limiting the spread of EVD.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map
