All the reports since then have been focused on the YF outbreak in the Luanda area. Now the number of suspected cases is up to 60. A reported focus of the efforts have been surveys to determine the presence of the _Aedes aegypti_ vector in the area. No mention is made of a vaccination campaign. One hopes that the intensification of preventive measures includes vaccination, and that the earlier report of a YF vaccine shortage has now been remedied.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32978>. - Mod.TY]
