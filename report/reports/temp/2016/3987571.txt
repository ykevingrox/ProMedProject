The Tribune News Service [edited]<http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/relief-for-tb-patients/190416.html>Bringing relief to thousands of tuberculosis [TB] patients or multidrug resistant (MDR) TB suspects, the Jalandhar Civil Hospital is all set to install a CB Net (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification testing for TB diagnosis) machine, which will ensure the testing of their samples in the city itself.While these MDR and XDR samples were previously being sent to PGI Chandigarh [the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in the city of Chandigarh, the capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana] for testing, now their sputum shall be tested in Jalandhar [Punjab] and the process which probably took weeks or more shall be made more prompt.With a steady rise in MDR TB cases over the years and a growing TB affected population as well, in 2015 India became a country with 23 per cent of the world share of the TB patients. With Punjab and the region also among one of the sensitive zones, given the pattern of TB patients, the installation of the machine is a much-required move.While in 2014 as many as 527 samples of MDR suspects had been sent for testing, in 2015 as many as 551 and this year [2016] so far, 53 samples of MDR suspect sputum have been sent for testing. After the machine is installed in Jalandhar, these shall all be tested locally. Additionally, while the procedure if pursued privately costs Rs 2500 [about USD 36.8] per test, now it will be done for free at the civil hospital.Steadily on the rise for the past few years, in the past 5 years the district has had 118 MDR plus XDR [extensively drug resistant] TB cases. Of these 4 are XDR TB cases. As many as 15 of these patients have died; 39 of these were female and 3 HIV positive. The district had 19 MDR TB patients in 2012; in 2013 there were 30 MDR TB patients under treatment; in 2014 these rose to 33 (plus 1 XDR TB) patients; in 2015, 29 (plus 2 XDR TB) patients; and in 2016 so far, 3 MDR and one XDR TB patient have been received at the local civil hospital. Notably, these are just the patients on treatment and the total number of TB patients lying undetected by the health authorities could be many more.MDR incidence is 3 per cent in new TB patients and as high as 15 to 17 per cent in previously treated patients. Prolonged cough, decreased immunity, lack of a proper diet, and a bad environment could be the chief contributing factors for TB incidence. The incidence of death among TB patients is 4 per cent.While health sources termed TB as one of the primary killers, among HIV positive patients, because it is opportunistic ailment, the higher monitoring of TB in Jalandhar is also essential in terms of surveillance of both these diseases which are clearly interconnected and both have a high incidence in Jalandhar.While 3 with MDR TB have been HIV positive in past 5 years the number of common [co-infected?] HIV positive and TB cases is much higher.The additional infrastructure also warrants more TB control staff for Jalandhar, which it is currently short of. There are only 6 lab technicians against 13 posts in the district, 2 supervisors against 12 posts, 2 persons on 5 lab supervisors posts, and the 1 post of computer operator also lies vacant. The TB unit also needs additional doctors, which it currently is short of.While speaking about MDR incidence in the district, Dr Rajiv Sharma, District TB Officer, said, ""There was a phase some years ago when TB suspects and patients had risen to an alarming level but presently things are under control and with path-breaking work on RNTCP (Revised National TB Control Programme) on both the local and national levels by the governments, more and more people are being identified and being brought under DOTS [Directly Observed Chemotherapy, Short Course] treatment.""While the putting up of the machine would also bring a spurt in cases, due to prompt diagnosis, Dr Sharma said in the long run it will help better identification and healthier populace.[Byline: Aparna Banerji]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[MDR TB is a form of tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least isoniazid plus rifampin, the 2 most potent 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a form of TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the 3 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).The ""cartridge based nucleic acid amplification testing for TB"" referred to in the news report above is likely the WHO-endorsed GeneXpert system, an integrated, automated, closed system, which enables rapid detection of DNA sequences present in sputum samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, as well as mutations in a gene that confer resistance to rifampin. Rifampin resistance is used as a surrogate marker for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Testing is completed within 2 hours, with minimal biohazard and performed by low-skilled workers who have very little technical training required to operate the equipment (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0907847>). A 4-module GeneXpert can process 16-20 specimens per 8 h working day (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740172/>). Because the equipment is expensive, and requires regular maintenance, uninterrupted electrical line power, plus a temperature-controlled operating environment, it will be unsuitable for more remote settings.As reported by the news report above, the recent presence of the GeneXpert system in Jalandhar will likely increase the number of MDR TB detected, but no tests for rapid identification of 2nd-line drug resistance are yet available (<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2008/WHO_HTM_TB_2008.392_eng.pdf>). Detection of resistance to a fluoroquinolone, injectable anti-TB drugs (such as, amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin), and other 2nd-line drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of XDR TB will still require drug susceptibility testing by more traditional culture-based methods that typically take 2-8 weeks to generate results, involve significant biohazard that necessitates high levels of biosafety practices and trained personnel (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179139/> and <http://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/laboratory/biosafetyguidance_xdrtb.htm>).Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/316>. Jalandhar district, with a population of 2 181 753 in 2011, is one of the 22 districts in the state of Punjab in north west India. - Mod.ML""Testing is completed ... with minimal biohazard and performed by low-skilled workers...""  Unfortunately, such workers are most likely to be careless when working with infectious material and should be tested regularly for infection. - Mod.JW]
