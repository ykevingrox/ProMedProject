KATU News [edited]<http://katu.com/news/health/mumps-outbreak-reported-in-marion-county>An outbreak of mumps is hitting Marion County [Oregon], with 4 confirmed cases of the infection since the beginning of October [2016]. Marion County Health Department officials said they have 8 more suspected mumps cases reported since [3 Oct 2016], including 2 patients that are related to people with lab confirmation.The people who contracted mumps didn't have vaccinations or the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] booster shot. The age range of those people is 1 year old to 40 years old. These are the 1st cases in Marion County since 2012.The mumps disease is caused by a virus. Symptoms include a fever, headache and muscle aches, tiredness, and swelling under the ears or jaw. It takes about 2 weeks to develop the symptoms after being exposed to someone with mumps. The disease can be spread through coughing or sneezes. Officials said it can be spread 2 days before signs of the illness show up until 5 days after the swelling appears.""The best way you can prevent mumps is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine,"" says Dr Karen Landers, Marion County health officer. The routine MMR vaccine starts at around 1 year of age. It also requires a booster to complete the vaccination. Landers said that the outbreaks are on the rise around the country in states like Maine, Missouri, and Arkansas.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Oregon can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5700>.

University officials say many of the cases have links to the Greek Life community [university fraternities and sororities].Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Items used by an infected person, such as cups or soft drink cans, can also be contaminated with the virus, which may spread to others if those items are shared. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. It is usually a mild disease, but can occasionally cause serious complications.The commonest complication is inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males who have reached puberty; rarely does this lead to fertility problems. Other rare complications include inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis), inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis) and/or breasts (mastitis) in females who have reached puberty, and deafness.[byline: Robert Herriman]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
