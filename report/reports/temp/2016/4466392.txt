El PeriÌ dico, Spain [in Spanish, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sanidad/sanidad-investiga-dos-posibles-nuevos-casos-fiebre-hemorragica-crimea-congo-madrid-5358835>Two women were hospitalized in the early hours of [Sat 3 Sep 2016] in Madrid for possible infections of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, the Ministry of Health reported in a statement, but it stressed that it is a preventive measure. ""In the last hours, the Community of Madrid has notified the Ministry of Health the detection of 2 people who meet the criteria for possible infection by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [virus] and this has triggered preventively protocols to rule out hemorrhagic fever viruses,"" it stated. One of the 2 women, who may be infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a health professional in the Central Clinical Laboratory who ""had contact with the infected patients"" and the other visited a town in Avila Province [Castile and Leon] with her husband, where they were exposed to ticks. Angel Gil, the spokesperson for the technical commission formed to study and monitor the disease, explained on Sat 3 Sep 2016 that both women have a fever. The expert added that ""as of today"" this outbreak is not worrying and pointed out that only 10 percent of those bitten by the _Hyalomma_ ticks, the transmitter of the disease, show symptoms [as not all ticks of the _Hyalomma_ genus of carry it]. The focus also is ""very localized and very defined."" The disease has already killed a man of 62 years last [25 Aug 2016] at the Gregorio MaraÌ±Ì n hospital in Madrid, where he was transferred from the Infanta Leonor hospital after being bitten by a tick while traveling around the community of San Juan del Molinillo [Avila Province]. Also, one of the nurses who attended the deceased is in intensive care at the hospital. These are the 1st 2 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever confirmed in Western Europe. The nurse in the High Level Isolation at the La Paz-Carlos III Hospital in Madrid ""remains stable, but in a grave condition.""The 2 cases under investigation are [a woman] who visited a town in Avila, in the vicinity of Solosancho [Castile and Leon], along with her husband, and who said they had been exposed to contact with ticks. This is a different region of Avila from that visited by the only fatal case. The other case, also a woman, is a health professional at the Central Clinical Laboratory of the Community of Madrid, located in the Infanta Sofia Hospital of San Sebastian de los Reyes, who has ""symptoms consistent with the disease"" and ""had contact with the affected patients."" Both remain in ""stable"" condition. The 2 women were taken to hospitals in mobile ICU units of Summa 112 [Madrid Medical Emergency Service] ""keeping the isolation protocols and measures in place in these cases,"" the Ministry of Health said in a statement, which is awaiting the results of the samples from both patients which have been sent to national center for microbiology to determine the pathology. A ""strictly preventive"" regime of the Ministry of Health in Madrid has been put in place for people who were in contact with the deceased and the nurse who was infected has been expanded from 190 to 282 people. In Catalonia, 2 technicians who handled the blood samples from the deceased person and forwarded them to different laboratories when trying to determine what illness the patient was suffering from, are also under surveillance.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org> [The outbreak of CCHF currently under development in Spain, the 1st in Western Europe, highlights an important aspect of the disease, the fact that it can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infected blood or body fluids. Furthermore, nosocomial spread through improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of syringe needles, and contamination of medical supplies has also been documented. - Corr.SB]******[2]Date: Sat 3 Sep 2016 5:38 PM GMTSource: The Telegraph UK [edited]<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/03/two-new-cases-in-spain-of-potentially-fatal-crimean-congo-haemor/>Health authorities in Spain have identified 2 new possible cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), 2 days after the virus claimed its 1st casualty in western Europe.The 2 women were on Friday evening [2 Sep 2016] placed in isolation wards in Madrid hospitals after showing symptoms of the deadly virus which is endemic to the Balkans, Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.One is a health worker from one of the city's regional health service's analysis laboratories ""who had contact with the affected patients.""The other woman admitted to hospital has said that her husband had recently been bitten by a tick in Ì vila province, the same area of central Spain where a 62-year-old man died after picking up the virus from a tick.The nurse who treated the man became infected and admitted last week to Madrid's La Paz-Carlos III hospital, the same ward where a nurse was treated in 2014 after contracting Ebola [virus disease] from a Spanish missionary who fell ill in Africa, and is said to be in a ""stable but serious condition"".Besides those in hospital, 282 people who had contact with one or both of the 2 confirmed cases are being closely monitored for symptoms CCHF has a fatality rate in humans of around 30 per cent, according to the World Health Organisation.The virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected blood or other bodily secretions. Initial symptoms are a headache, fever, aching muscles and neck or back, dizziness, plus possible vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sore throat, followed by mood swings and depression. Finally, the liver is affected and bleeding rashes appear on the skin, mouth, and throat. Severely ill patients may experience kidney, liver or lung failure after around five days of showing symptoms.The incubation period after a tick bite is up to 9 days. There is no specific treatment or vaccine. The presence of CCHF in Spanish ticks was first discovered in 2011, when scientists warned that the disease would become a threat to humans in the country. But authorities have called for calm, saying that person-to-person infection outside of hospitals and residences is extremely rare.[Byline: James Badcock]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The detection of CCHF in Spain underlines the fact that disease spread is not limited geographically and, like people, vectors are likely to travel far and cause disease. The preventive measures must include a plan for education and training of the health care workers who may be exposed to new cases. - Mod.UBAMaps of Spain can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/europe/political-map-of-Spain.gif and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2506>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
