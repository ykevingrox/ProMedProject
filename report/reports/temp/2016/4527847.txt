The Pride LA [edited]<http://thepridela.com/2016/09/back-to-the-future-syphilis-rates-explode-as-gonorrhea-becomes-untreatable/> Syphilis rates among gay men have been rising in Los Angeles County [California] and around the country for several years, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to finally take a look at the numbers of this sexually transmitted disease on a state-by-state level.Nationwide data shows a 15 percent increase in the number of syphilis infections overall from 2013 to 2014 alone.Two new studies presented at the CDC's 2016 STD Prevention Conference [<https://www.cdc.gov/stdconference/>], however, suggest that syphilis is taking a particularly severe toll on gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), especially in the Southeastern U.S.Nationally, the data show the estimated [primary and secondary] syphilis rate among MSM is 309 cases per 100 000. But estimates vary state-to-state for syphilis [incidence] rates among MSM from 73.1 per 100 000 individuals in Alaska to 748.3 per 100 000 individuals in North Carolina -- with no real explanation as to why that state's rates are so high. California levels [at nearly 332.2 cases per 100 000] are well above the national average.
