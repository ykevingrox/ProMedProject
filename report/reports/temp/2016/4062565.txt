The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health Epidemiological Bulletin up to and including week 6 (week ending 19 Feb 2016), does not list cases in that state.The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) as was likely the case of the infected pregnant woman. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures, as apparently was the case with the physician and the nurse. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety. Unfortunately, nosocomial transmission is not unusual.Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. There has been no indication that a village-level control effort has been initiated yet.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2341>. - Mod.TY]
