The Sydney Morning Herald [edited]<http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/black-lung-world-expert-to-check-qld-miners-after-fourth-case-confirmed-20160105-glzy7f.html>A world expert in black lung disease will examine the 100 000 X-rays of Queensland coal miners after confirmation of a 4th case of the disease in Queensland.Black lung disease, or pneumoconiosis, is a fatal emphysema-like choking infection caused by microscopic coal dust fibres.The 1st confirmed case in Queensland in 30 years was confirmed in May 2015 and reported in September 2015 in the Commissioner for Mines Safety and Health 2014-15 annual report.Since then, 2 more cases of black lung disease in Queensland were confirmed in October and a 4th case in late December [2015], a spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources and Mines said.Dr Robert Cohen of the University of Illinois has been contracted by Melbourne-based Monash University expert Dr Malcolm Simm to review safety procedures and look at the X-rays of Queensland mine workers.In the United States, Dr Cohen has suggested coal mine workers are working longer shifts and are unable to adequately clear their lungs.Queensland's coal mines contained more coal dust in 2015 than they did in 2012, Queensland's Mines Commissioner has found.The 100 000 coal miner X-rays are stored at the Queensland government's Safety in Mine Training and Research Station (SIMTARS) at Redbank.Mine union state secretary Tim Whyte said the CFMEU [Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union] was very worried that the 75 suspected cases of black lung disease identified in a 1984 study for the Queensland Coal Board had not been thoroughly tested.That 1984 study said those 75 suspected cases should be followed up annually by Queensland Health, which provided the initial checks to Queensland's 7784 coal mines at 33 sites.""Miners and other persons employed about mines who have been shown to have chest X-rays demonstrating the features of overt pneumoconiosis -- or a pattern suggesting early changes due to the effects of coal dust ... should be reviewed at more frequent intervals, potentially annually.""Mr Whyte said the CFMEU still had doubts about the ability of radiographers to be able to read X-rays to check for black lung, separate from emphysema and bronchial infections.The CFMEU is funding checks by US-based experts because they believe Queensland-trained radiographers do not have the specialised skills to recognise the disease, Mr Whyte said.""The doctors that the Queensland department are getting over here, we have had to shame them a bit, saying that if you don't get these people over here to train our doctors to the standards, we will pay for them to come over, pay for their airfare and accommodation and the whole lot.""An Ipswich man who is one of Queensland's 4 confirmed cases of black lung disease, told Fairfax Media before Christmas [2015] he was never told he was suspected of having the disease despite multiple X-rays until he resigned in 1997.""We got chest X-rays. But they never told the miners what the chest X-rays were like, whether they were bad or good,"" [he man] said.However, a Natural Resources and Mines spokesman rejected the criticism from the union, saying Queensland radiographers could identify black lung disease.He said the only US expert being paid for by the Monash study was Dr Robert Cohen.The Mines spokesman said questions about the fate of the 75 persons suspected of having black lung disease in 1984 needed to be addressed to Queensland Health because it provided the health data for the Queensland Coal Board after the 1984 report.Mine unions say the potential black lung scandal could end up as widespread as the James Hardie asbestos health case, when thousands of people who worked with asbestos contracted mesothelioma. A trust fund for workers was eventually set up.A SIMTARS spokeswoman said the X-rays had been examined, but was unclear whether they had been examined for ""black lung"".However, the spokesman for Natural Resources and Mines said they simply stored X-rays, which had been previously checked by the miners' doctors.""The results of health assessments undertaken through the Coal Mine Workers Health Scheme are provided by the medical professionals involved to the mine worker. A copy is subsequently provided to the department for storage,"" the spokesman said in a statement.""Many thousands of records are held by the department but what the department receives are copies of medical assessments and X-rays that have already been completed and reviewed by doctors then returned to the patient.""[Byline: Tony Moore]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[More information about pneumoconiosis can be found in ProMED-mail post 20151204.3839036.Let us hope that those 75 do not have this disease, but they should be followed up and assisted if they do. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285>.]
