La Discusion <http://www.ladiscusion.cl/noticia.php?id=4634>The Health SEREMI [Regional Ministry of Health] for Biobio confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in an 11-year-old child from Los Angeles, the 9th recorded this year [2016] in the region.The Health SEREMI has ordered an epidemiological-environmental investigation to establish the possible place of infection. Preliminary background information said that the child recently traveled to the Millantu area in Santa Fe.The patient is stable, hospitalized in the [Medical] Assistance Complex Victor Rios Ruiz in Los Angeles, without oxygen.Of the 9 confirmed cases [of hantavirus infections this year (2016)], 5 occurred in the province of Nuble and 4 in the province of Biobio.If one compares regional morbidity data, 2015 ended with 13 cases, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 0.62 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, with 4 more cases than have occurred in the current year (2016), which has an increasing rate of 0.42 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.""Essentially, our Epidemiology Unit has confirmed for us the 9th case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in our region, 56 percent of cases in the province of Nuble and 44 percent in the province of Bio Bio. There has been a decrease in the infection rate that is less than that of 2015, as well as an important 11 percent reduction in fatalities. 2014 closed with a fatality rate of 69.2 percent, while in 2015, it was 46.1 percent,"" said Health SEREMI Director Mauritius Careaga.The reduction in cases may have been due to the regional prevention plan developed by the health authority, which has considered intersectoral strategies and actions in epidemiological surveillance, public and occupational health, zoonosis control and supervision, as well as in communications.Work in the area of epidemiological surveillance includes an alert system sent to delegates of epidemiology of all public and private establishments in the health care network; investigation of suspected cases and follow-up with contacts, according to current legislation; strengthening immediate notification of suspected cases in an outbreak situation; and clinical follow-up of contacts exposed to environmental risk.At the level of recommendations to the public in the field of waste management, the Health SEREMI stressed the need to collect trash at the time it is produced, storing it in bags, and burying all garbage at sunset away from camps or homes at a depth greater than 50 cm [20 inches]. Latrines should be constructed in open, airy and sunny places, and cleaned daily.In relation to food, emphasis is being placed on the need for both agricultural workers and tourists to keep food in airtight and resistant containers, washing kitchen utensils after use, and keeping food in metal boxes. Additionally, it is recommended not to collect wild fruits that grow at ground level, in low shrubs, or fruit fallen on the ground [that may have been contaminated by rodents].Rural workers are recommended to walk by established paths, avoid dense forest or scrub areas, make walks during daylight hours, keep collected firewood in ventilated areas, avoid staying in storage sheds, barns, or other buildings that have remained closed for long periods of time, and to protect against infection when working in places where there may have been or are long-tailed rodents by using personal protection equipment.There is an ongoing investigation of a suspected case in a child of less than 7 years residing in Santiago that has been diagnosed with atypical pneumonia [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]. Results of laboratory tests from samples sent to the ISP are expected, and field investigations are ongoing to establish the place of infection. Family sources indicate that the child visited the area of Laja [and may have been infected there.

As we have commented before, Andes hantavirus is endemic in Chile, and cases of infection are reported every year in the Bio Bio region. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus infection, some with pulmonary syndrome, occur every year, and apparently this is the 9th case in the region this year (2016). Infections are acquired when people are exposed to virus-containing excreta from infected rodents. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. However, it is good that the Epidemiological Surveillance unit is following up with those having had contact with the boy as a standard practice.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/chilfung/chile_regions.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/36633>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>.]
