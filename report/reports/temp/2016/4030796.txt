ADN [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://adnrionegro.com.ar/2016/02/confirman-muertes-por-hantavirus-en-el-bolson/>The Zonal Hospital director, Merdeces Ibero, stated that the death of a policeman and a 17 year old adolescent was due to [a] hantavirus [infection]. In both cases, the results of [samples] sent to the Malbran Institute were positive, reported the BarilocheOpina website.The 17 year old young man had been hospitalized in previous days in the private regional hospital with a serious respiratory condition and died some hours later.The physicians were able to find out that within the past 30 days, the youth had taken part in cleaning up some land and was camping, so the possibility that he had acquired the disease under these circumstances was not discarded.The police officer was 24 years old, and came from Formosa [province]. He worked in El Bolson [Rio Negro province] and was moved to the San Carlos Sanatorium in Bariloche and after having spent some time in the hospital in this locality he had a high fever and symptoms compatible with this disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome].--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Without differential laboratory tests, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these or in any of the previous cases. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 5 years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).Andes virus seems likely in this case. This virus is endemic in the Andean region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Details of possible exposure to Andes virus were not provided, but may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.argentina.org.au/images/mapa-politico-argentina.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34112>. - Mod.TY]
