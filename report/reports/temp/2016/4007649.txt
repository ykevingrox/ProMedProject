El Universal [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.eluniversal.com/vida/160208/alertan-de-casos-de-fiebre-hemorragica-aguda-en-barinas>What was diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever in Barinas [state], where 60 people have died, causes alarm and worry among epidemiologists, who think that the disease that has caused these deaths is related to an outbreak of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever [VHF], and not the disease [virus] transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.""Such high lethality in such a short time, obliges us to immediately think for other more likely diagnoses. One can observe this epidemiological behavior in other febrile hemorrhagic disease outbreaks such as Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever. We do not have sufficient details, but it is much more likely that one of these hypothesized diagnoses is responsible, in which case health authorities must immediately take measures for surveillance, monitoring, prevention, and control,"" stated the network Defendamos la Epidemiologia [Let's Defend Epidemiology].[Venezuelan] hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease produced by Guanarito virus. The vector [host] that transmits it to humans is the cane rat, and transmission is accomplished by contact, via respiratory tract, with the excreta of this rat that usually is inoffensive and keeps away from humans.They explain that incursion into their habitat by farmers is what favors acquisition of the disease [virus]. The areas most affected are the municipalities in the south of Portuguesa state including Guanarito, Papelon, and San Genaro. In Barinas [state] they are in the east in the municipality of Sosa, and in the west in Guarico.In 2015, 16 cases of VHF were registered and also in 2015 the last cases of yellow fever were registered in the country. They added that the confirmation of hemorrhagic fever would be the 5th outbreak of the disease in the country following its identification for the 1st time in 1989.The network calls on the health authorities to not keep silent.[Byline: Carolina Contreras A.]--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[The time span over which the 60 fatalities occurred is not specified, nor are the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infections. ProMED-mail would be interested to know when these cases become laboratory confirmed as VHF or diagnosed as something else.Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF) is caused by Guanarito virus, that is rodent-borne. VHF has occurred sporadically in that country, with a 40 per cent case fatality rate. The disease is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally convulsions.Guanarito virus is an arenavirus. The rodent reservoirs of Guanarito virus are the Alston's cotton rat _Sigmodon alstoni_ (see image at <http://bit.ly/1Tcct0P>) and the short-tailed cane mouse _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ (see image at <http://bit.ly/1PCnm67>).References----------1.
