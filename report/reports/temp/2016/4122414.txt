Public Health England (PHE) [edited]<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-health-england-highlights-the-late-flu-season>Public Health England (PHE) is reminding people to be aware of the risk of flu [influenza] over the Easter period [25-28 Mar 2016].------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The latest figures published at 2 pm today [24 Mar 2016] indicate flu continues to circulate in the community late in the season, with several indicators remaining elevated, in particular influenza confirmed hospitalisations amongst younger adults. The figures show 163 new admissions to ICU [intensive care unit] and HDU [high dependency unit] were reported in the week ending [13 Mar 2016], a similar high rate to the previous week.This is later activity than the 2014 to 2015 season, when hospitalisations for flu had already peaked in early January 2015.Virus surveillance from the UK and elsewhere in Europe shows the strain A(H1N1)pdm09 has been the main flu virus this season [2015-2016] with more recent evidence of increasing influenza B activity.Previous flu seasons dominated by A(H1N1)pdm09 suggest this strain particularly affects children, pregnant women, and adults with long term conditions like chronic heart disease, liver disease, neurological disease and respiratory disease in particular.Dr Richard Pebody, head of flu surveillance for PHE said: "" Although we're nearing April and the perception may be flu season is over, we are seeing flu continue to circulate in the community, along with other seasonal illnesses like scarlet fever. For most people influenza infection is just a nasty experience, but for some it can lead to illnesses that are more serious, including bronchitis and secondary bacterial pneumonia, which can be life threatening.""""Although it is late in the season, vaccine may still be available from GPs and pharmacists for those in eligible risk groups who are unvaccinated. This includes children and adults with long term health conditions and pregnant women, so speak to your GP or pharmacist about the vaccine if you're eligible and haven't had it yet this flu season. It's also important people, particularly those in vulnerable groups, remain aware of the risks of flu and practise good hand hygiene to prevent the spread of flu.""""For most people flu is generally a mild illness with recovery taking around a week without treatment. But people in vulnerable groups, or parents of children with flu should be aware of the risks of the virus, and contact their GP if they are concerned about their symptoms. People at high risk of the virus may need treatment with antivirals.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] USA: Pennsylvania, Indiana, FloridaPennsylvania------------Date: Sat 26 Mar 2016Source: The Indiana Gazette [edited]<https://www.indianagazette.com/news/indiana-news/indiana-county-sees-late-spike-in-flu-cases,23908400/>Though we are nearly 75 percent through a relatively mild influenza season, Indiana County, among others in Pennsylvania, is seeing an abnormally late spike in confirmed reports of influenza.  For the past 3 years, the biggest spike during the season was in mid- to late December, according to a December 2015 Associated Press story.""There's not much flu going around so far,"" the article reads, ""unlike the last 3 seasons when doctors' offices were filled with patients before Christmas, and illnesses peaked by late December.""The official influenza surveillance season runs from the 40th week of the year, which is the beginning of October, until the 20th week of the next year, in May, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Statewide, 15 043 confirmed flu cases have been reported this season [2015-2016].Indiana County has reported 185 confirmed flu cases, ranking it 24th of the 67 counties in the state, according to the health department.David McDevitt, Indiana Regional Medical Center's [IRMC] infection control coordinator, said the hospital has reported 153 cases of influenza since the beginning of the season. 44 of those cases have been reported since the beginning of March [2016] -- about 29 percent of IRMC's total reports so far for the season.""It's definitely picked up,"" he said. ""In October [2015], we had something like 36 that we reported, and then it dropped off to just very few, and then it started picking up again toward the end of January, February and into March [2016].""The time of year that cases of the flu spike and drop is heavily dependent on the predominant influenza strain that is going around during that particular season, McDevitt said.""The flu season sort of varies depending on what the strain is and the population that the strain hits,"" he said. ""The H1N1 strain tends to hit the younger adults and the elderly, whereas the H3N5 strain hit mostly older people. All of that comes into play to determine when the cases are most likely going to hit -- if it's going to be an early flu season or if it's going to be a later flu season. This year [2016], it's coming a little bit later than what we normally see.""He said most of IRMC's flu patients have been anywhere from infants to under the age of 30. Middle-aged and elderly people have also been seen, but not quite as often, which, he said, is not surprising.""The age group that is being hit with the flu right now is pretty much the same age group that we saw back in 2009 with the pandemic H1N1 strain, because it's the same strain that is circulating now. So, there's been no real change in the demographic of which group of people that strain is hitting.""Nearby counties reported the following numbers of confirmed cases to the health department: Allegheny County, 1229 cases; Armstrong County, 68; Cambria County, 87; Clarion County, 38; Clearfield County, 69; Jefferson County, 40; and Westmoreland County, 198.Northampton County reported the most cases, 1328, and Forest County reported just 2 confirmed influenza cases][Byline: Casey Kelly][The state of Pennsylvania can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/240>.

""Protect yourself and your family, if you have not gotten the flu vaccine you are urged to do so, it's not too late. If you do become sick with the flu please stay home.""In addition to getting the flu vaccine, the department said people should take the following everyday precautions:- try to avoid close contact with sick people;- cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it;- wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub;- avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs spread this way;- clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu.[The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3735>.

These reports reflect a general trend reflected over most of Europe and North America, which, if seen year after year, will require a review of vaccine recommendations and perhaps deliberating on the length of the 'official' flu season. - Mod.UBAMap of United Kingdom: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>Map of USA:  <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>]
