Although the food workers were replaced, it is likely that the workers were not the source but rather contamination of foods eaten without cooking (such as salads) or problems with kitchen hygiene caused the cases. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11165>.]
