The Health officials in both districts confided to Maravi Post in an interview that using unsafe water for consumption is believed to be the main cause of the rapid spread of the disease.While Rumphi has registered no deaths in 41 cases during a period of 5 days, officials in Karonga, a district which has suffered most with the disease since April 2016, has 13 deaths with 225 cases registered.Spokesperson for Rumphi district hospital Wanalori Mwamulima says ""health officials are doing their best to curb the disease."" ""The disease started on [Fri 13 May 2016] with 9 cases registered but as I am talking to you the figure has drastically shot to 41.""""The most affected parts are the lake shore areas such as Mulowe, Luwuchi, Chitimba, as well as Chiwata,"" but the health personnel are doing their best,"" said Mwamurima.Karonga Environmental Health Officer Luis Tukula said nothing has changed despite the sensitization campaign on the disease. ""It's very unfortunate that the disease continue devastating people's lives despite our efforts as a hospital. Imagine 13 deaths and 225 registered cases, this is not a joke,"" worried Tukula. He said ""as of now, about 15 people are battling for their lives at the main hospital.""They both confirmed to Maravi Post that the case may vastly spread especially if the residents continue to use untreated water.

All the cases were reported in the past 15 days. The numbers have gone up after the Jamdoli incident where 12 persons died after suffering from diarrhea and vomiting in the 2nd half of April 2016. Cases of cholera have been reported from different parts of the city. The health department officials said that there are confirmed cases of cholera, both from the city and the rural areas.The health authorities conducted tests of patients coming to hospitals with complaints of diarrhea and vomiting. Those who were diagnosed with cholera were rushed to Sawai Man Singh hospital and JK Lon hospital for treatment.The health experts claimed that cholera is caused due to infected food and water. However, in the past few days, it has been seen that people are falling ill due to diarrhea and vomiting as water supplied in their areas was found unsuitable for drinking. The health department officials are also suspecting contaminated water as a major cause for illness.""We are taking samples of water from different parts of the city to test the level of chlorination. Whenever we find that the level of chlorination is not up to the mark, we immediately inform the public health and engineering department (PHED) to conduct chlorination of water in that particular area,"" said Dr Narottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur I).The cases of cholera were reported from Kanota, Gopalpura Bypass area and other areas of the city where contaminated water and improper hygiene is a serious problem.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.Jaipur is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan in Northern India and it can be found on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur>. - Mod.LL]******[5] Cholera - India (Uttar Pradesh State)Date: Fri 6 May 2016Source: Daily News and Analysis (DNA) [edited]<http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-mathura-cholera-looms-large-around-100-sufferers-identified-2210027>Two days after 2 children died following consuming milk as part of mid-day meal at a school in Kansi Ram colony in Mathura [Uttar Pradesh], the area is facing another crisis -- with over 100 people suffering from cholera which ""virtually has taken an epidemic form.""""The number of children and adults suffering from vomiting and loose motion has swelled from 48 by Thursday evening, 5 May 2016, to 118 today,"" officiating Chief Medical Officer [CMO] Dr Sajjan Kumar said. Since only 29 children had consumed milk on Wed 4 May 2016, as part of mid-day meal and a majority are of different age groups, it has been established that cholera has spread in the area, District Magistrate Rajesh Kumar said. ""There was no casualty today. On the basis of stool test it has been established that most of the patients are suffering from cholera which virtually has taken an epidemic form,"" he said, adding the other cause appears to be mixing of drain water with drinking water.""Over 100 patients have been discharged after treatment and 79 are still admitted at different hospitals but they are out of danger,"" the district magistrate said.Since nothing wrong was found in the overhead water tank of Kanshi Ram Colony, underground pipeline leading to different houses, was checked. ""At a few places the pipeline was found damaged with some portion in contact with drains. It may be another reason of cholera,"" he said.A temporary 20-bed hospital, lead by 2 doctors, has been set up in the primary school adjacent to Kanshi Ram Colony. Also 2 teams of experts will arrive here from Lucknow, Kumar said. Since cases from adjacent Baad, Aurangabad, and Sarai Azmabad villages have also been reported, 50 beds have been added in Swarn Jayanti Hospital and District Hospitals each, he said.""Cleanliness drive with 250 Safai Karmi has started in the area. Since it is an infectious disease, people are advised not to consume stale food or cut fruits and wash hand before eating,"" Kumar added. The officiating CMO said though he is not in a position to give the exact break up of the patients, a majority of them are children and asserted that cholera may be another reason of the casualties and people falling ill.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not likely that the milk was a reservoir unless it was directly or indirectly mixed with the contaminated water.

The officials attributed the contamination to water rationing that has been enforced since January 2016 because of the drought. From March to April alone, diarrhea has affected 1539 people in Zamboanga, health officials reported. Also affected were about 400 prison inmates.Diarrhea can be easily treated with affordable medicine. Still, it continues to be the 2nd leading cause of death among children under 5 around the world, according to the WHO. The problem is most prevalent in impoverished communities and in areas with inadequate sanitation and water treatment facilities. Weak public health services aggravate the problem.Even cholera, which has been eradicated in many countries, continues to be reported from Mindanao to Metro Manila. Bottled distilled water has become a thriving business as Filipinos fear that water from the tap may be contaminated. For millions of impoverished Filipinos, however, bottled water is a luxury, and even boiling water to get rid of bacteria means additional expenses for cooking gas.Health officials traced the diarrhea in Zamboanga to a severe rotavirus outbreak from contaminated water. The infection is a common cause of vomiting and diarrhea in infants, and can cause severe dehydration. Treatment for dehydration, vomiting and gastroenteritis, however, are widely available.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>Maps of the Philippines <http://www.charleskeng.com/images-map/philmap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1017>.
