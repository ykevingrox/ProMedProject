The Northeast Today [edited]<http://thenortheasttoday.com/assam-japanese-encephalitis-adds-to-flood-woes/>With the situation slowly improving in the flooded districts of Assam, the fear of resurgence of Japanese encephalitis [JE] hover over the affected areas. Over 295 JE positive cases have been reported from the state with 66 casualties so far.Health experts and specialists of vector-borne diseases have expressed concern that with rise in the temperature and humidity post-deluge, the mosquitoes that act as potential vectors for the JE virus will become active again in spreading the disease.""This is the peak season for JE. Humidity and rise in temperature act as catalysts for the breeding of mosquitoes that are disease-carrying vectors for the JE virus. Rain washes away the breeding grounds during floods. But once floodwaters recede, the environment becomes favourable for spreading of the disease,"" said BC Bhagabati, state surveillance officer, IDSP [Integrated Disease Surveillance Project].Research experts who have written extensively on JE epidemiology have cited that rainfall contributes to increased mosquito breeding. Rainfall increases relative humidity in atmosphere, which raises the lifespan of adult mosquitoes. ""Temperature and rainfall have been reported to be associated with the density of mosquito population and highly related to the occurrence of JE. Floods wash away the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes but JE attacks increase if water remains stagnant,"" said a researcher.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Assam is in the midst of its usual JE virus transmission season. JE virus is endemic in northeastern India and more cases can be expected over the remainder of the transmission season. It seems odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination either in the recent past or plans for a campaign, given the concern about a resurgence in vector populations and JE cases as floodwaters recede.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299>. - Mod.TY]
