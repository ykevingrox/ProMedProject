Food Safety News [edited]<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/09/new-mexico-parasite-infection-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/#.V-VyiPCLTIU>For the 1st time since CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in 2015 documented 2 siblings with cryptosporidiosis associated with raw milk consumption, a state is blaming an invasion of the microscopic parasites on raw milk. New Mexico officials want people to dump raw milk, warning the cryptosporidium parasite causes a diarrheal disease known as cryptosporidiosis.New Mexico has confirmed 6 new cases of ""crypto"" since 31 Aug 2016. The state put its departments of health, agriculture, and environment to work investigating where the parasites are coming from. All the victims are from Bernalillo County, and all drank raw milk before being infected with the parasites. Epidemiologists, laboratory staff and inspectors are still working to narrow down the exact source, but the state has been warning the public about raw milk since 15 Sep 2016.""Raw milk products may be contaminated with a variety of infectious pathogens,"" New Mexico Secretary of Health Lynn Gallagher said in a public notice. ""We are particularly concerned about the very young, the elderly, and others with compromised immune systems who may develop more severe illnesses if exposed to contaminated raw milk products.""New Mexico health officials are advising that anyone with raw milk in their refrigerators should discard it to prevent infection. Any products made from raw milk should also be viewed as a health danger, the state warns. Raw milk is any milk that has not gone through pasteurization, a heating process to destroy potentially harmful bacteria, including _Campylobacter_, _E. coli_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_ and _Cryptosporidium_.The crypto parasite is protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside a host body for some time. It is very tolerant of chlorine disinfection. There are numerous strains of crypto that can infect animals and a few that can infect humans. Water, including drinking and recreational water, is the most common way for the parasite to spread. It is the leading cause of waterborne disease in the USA, where some of the larger outbreaks have been at swimming pools and splash parks in Southwestern states.The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on 27 Feb 2015, said unpasteurized, raw milk was the source of 2 cryptosporidiosis cases in August 2014 that were linked to a state-licensed dairy in Idaho. The report said the cases showed how infrequently cryptosporidium in raw milk is considered.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of New Mexico can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1843>. Bernalillo County in central New Mexico can be seen on the map at <http://geology.com/county-map/new-mexico-county-map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJIn the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article>), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products; 73 (60 percent) involved unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ spp, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ spp, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL]
