This includes funding surveillance, human resources for stewardship (that is, prescribers, pharmacists, nurses, community health workers, etc) and infection prevention interventions. All the attention in the run up to the United Nations General Assembly high level meeting is on funding research and development, which is important, but as we all know, conservation is going to be crucial in the short- to medium-term.[1.
