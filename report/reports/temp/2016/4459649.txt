There are 2 confirmed cases and 7 suspected cases of mumps in the Springdale area, which is the largest cluster since 2010, the Arkansas Department of Health said on Wed 31 Aug [2016].The outbreak currently affects 4 schools in the Springdale School District. Health Department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said that unvaccinated students who attend a school with a confirmed case of mumps must stay home for 26 calendar days -- the maximum incubation period for mumps -- from the point of exposure. Mirivel said those afflicted include both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.Mumps is a viral infection that causes swelling in the salivary glands and cheeks. Those with the illness may also have headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, and low-grade fevers.""Mumps is easily spread from person to person,"" state epidemiologist Dr Dirk Haselow said. ""We expect to see more cases in the coming weeks. We urge Arkansans to make sure that they and their loved ones are up-to-date on the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 per cent (range: 66-95 per cent) effective at preventing mumps; one dose is 78 per cent (range: 49-92 per cent) effective.See further discussion of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine in ProMED-mail posts listed below.A map of the USA showing location of Arkansas can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208>. - Mod.LK]
