He was treated symptomatically and sent home on the same day. On [31 Dec 2015], the patient travelled to Oman with family members and returned back to Abu Dhabi on [1 Jan 2016]. On the same day, he developed symptoms and was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [10 Jan 2016]. He passed away on [25 Jan 2016]. The patient had a history of frequent contact with camels. He consumed raw camel milk once in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He had no history of exposure to other risk factors in Abu Dhabi and in Oman in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms.2- An 85-year-old female from Abu Dhabi was detected through the tracing of contacts. The patient is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (see above). She has no history of exposure to other risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [13 Jan 2016]. Currently, she is asymptomatic and admitted to a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1632 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 587 related deaths.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[This is the WHO report with more details on the case(s) reported in MERS-CoV (06): UAE (AZ) 20160114.3937314. The common thread in recently reported cases seems to be that the index case has a history of contact with camels, and then asymptomatic infected contacts are occasionally identified.The HealthMap/ProMED map of the United Arab Emirates can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/132>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Oman, epidemiologic investigation - MOHDate: 26 Jan 2016From: Seif Al-Abri <salabri@gmail.com> [edited]We conducted the public health investigation [in Oman, and] there is no link between the 2 recent cases reported from Oman; they both live in different areas and have been admitted to 2 different hospitals, 200 km away from each other.The PCR screening of all the contacts from the newly diagnosed patient who is currently in Thailand are all negative.All 3 Omani patients with MERS-CoV infection in the past 12 months (75 year old diagnosed in Thailand in June 2015, 44 year old diagnosed in Oman in early January 2016, and the 71 year old diagnosed in Thailand from 24 Jan 2016) had a history of direct contact with camels.--Dr Seif Al-AbriDirector GeneralDirectorate General for Disease Surveillance and ControlMinistry of Health,Sultanate of Oman<salabri@gmail.com>[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Seif Al-Abri for providing information on the epidemiologic investigation's findings in Oman on this newly reported case of MERS-CoV infection currently admitted to a hospital in Thailand (see MERS-CoV (10): Saudi Arabia (MK), Thailand ex Oman, RFI 20160125.3964309, MERS-COV (08): Thailand ex Oman, Saudi Arabia corr 20160124.3962172).Again, a common observation is that recently confirmed cases have a history of contact with camels and have not been associated with nosocomial transmission.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Oman can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/124>. - Mod.MPP******[3] Saudi Arabia - WHODate: 26 Jan 2016Source: WHO Global Alert and Response Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://who.int/csr/don/26-january-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Between [27 Dec 2015 and 13 Jan 2016], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.Details of the cases1- A 50-year-old male from Madinah city developed symptoms on [3 Jan 2016] and, on [10 Jan 2016], was admitted to hospital in Madinah.

The above reported cases from Saudi Arabia provide additional details from previous reports (see prior ProMED-mail reports below).It appears as though the common theme in today's [26 Jan 2016] updates is that recently reported cases of MERS-CoV infection are primarily associated with contact with camels. Hopefully, there will not be recurrent nosocomial outbreaks as seen in the past.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
