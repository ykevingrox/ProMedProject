Times of Israel [edited]<http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-to-retest-thousands-of-blood-donations-for-syphilis/>Israel will retest thousands of blood donations made since June [2016], after the manufacturer of the kits used to check the blood for syphilis said they may be faulty, the Health Ministry said Wednesday [5 Oct 2016].The ministry reassured the public that the chances of infection were almost zero, but authorities were still taking extra precautions to ""track down anyone who may have been infected and to prevent any future infections.""The European manufacturer of the syphilis test kits informed the Health Ministry on Sunday [2 Oct 2016], the eve of the Jewish New Year, that there was a problem with the sensitivity of the kits, which had failed to detect the syphilis virus [sic, bacterium] in 2 instances of people who were recently infected with the sexually transmitted disease.The ministry said that the chances of regular transfusion recipients getting the disease were minuscule, but said there was a small risk for patients who received a platelet transfusion. ""The virus [sic, bacterium] is very sensitive to cold and so the chances of it being transferred from packets that were refrigerated or frozen are negligible,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""However, there is a small risk for those who received platelet transfers, which are stored at room temperature.""Anyone who was found to have been infected or who gave a donation while carrying the disease would be informed and treated. Syphilis is treated with antibiotics and responds well to it, the ministry said.The Health Ministry routinely checks blood donations for diseases that can be transmitted through blood, like HIV AIDS, hepatitis, and syphilis.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 6 Oct 2016 Source: Haaretz [edited]<http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.745996>Israel's Health Ministry has started retesting tens of thousands of blood donations sent to hospitals over the last few months for fear that they are infected with syphilis.But the ministry said the likelihood of anyone actually contracting syphilis from the blood is nil, noting that no case of syphilis resulting from a blood transfusion has occurred anywhere in the world in recent years.The tests, which began on Wednesday morning [5 Oct 2016], will encompass all donations sent out by the Magen David Adom [MDA] blood bank between June [2016] and the start of this week. Prof. Eilat Shinar, who runs MDA's blood service, explained that even blood that has already been given to a patient can be checked, because the blood bank keeps samples of every donation ""precisely for cases like this."" She estimated that the new round of tests will take a few weeks.The blood is being retested because the European Medicines Agency, after testing the syphilis detection kits manufactured by the Irish company Trinity Biotech, concluded that the kits aren't sufficiently sensitive. Specifically, they failed to detect the disease in its very early stages, immediately after infection occurred, in two out of every three blood samples tested. Since the kits are used in Israel, Trinity reported that finding to the Health Ministry.However, the kits did successfully detect the disease in samples taken from people who had been infected earlier.The ministry now plans to retest all donated blood with kits from a different company to ensure that it isn't infected. Should it discover the _Treponema pallidum_ bacteria, which causes syphilis, in any of the samples, both donor and recipient will be summoned for medical testing to determine whether they need treatment.The ministry said that even if some donated blood is found to contain the bacteria, the chances of anyone contracting syphilis from it are ""negligible,"" for several reasons. First, the bacterium is very sensitive to cold, so the chances of it surviving in blood that has been refrigerated or frozen is minimal. Consequently, the risk exists mainly for people who received platelet transfusions, since platelets are stored at room temperature.Second, syphilis is very rare among Israeli blood donors, occurring in only eight out of every 100,000 donations, and most infected donations are from new donors, who account for only 15 percent of all donations. Finally, in two-thirds of diagnosed donors, the infection did not occur right before the donation, meaning its chances of being detected by the Trinity kits would be high.[Byline: Ronny Linder-Ganz]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Syphilis can be transmitted via blood and blood products, when donors are in the primary or secondary stage of the disease as a consequence of spirochetemia during these phases of the disease (<http://www.tmreviews.com/article/S0887-7963(96)80005-8/abstract>). However, in the US, syphilis infections are uncommon in potential blood donors; the American Red Cross reported just 324 cases in potential donors between 2007-2008, and the last reported case of transfusion-transmitted syphilis in the US occurred in 1966 (Chambers RW, Foley HT, Schmidt PJ: Transmission of syphilis by fresh blood components. Transfusion. 1969 Jan-Feb; 9(1): 32-4).In the US, to identify donors at risk of transmitting syphilis, their blood is screened, using non-treponemal tests (such as, VDRL and RPR), which detect antibodies that are not specifically directed against _Treponema pallidum_, or treponemal tests (such as, FTA-ABS), which detect antibodies specific for _T. pallidum_ (<http://tinyurl.com/jxn53fq>). However, neither is particularly useful in diagnosing the disease during the 1st 3-4 weeks following exposure, when non-treponemal or treponemal antibodies may not yet be present. However, in regions where the incidence of syphilis is particularly low and banked blood is stored at refrigerator temperatures before use (_T. pallidum_ lose viability after 5 days under refrigerated blood bank storage conditions), the risk of transfusion-transmitted syphilis should be low.Trinity Biotech manufactures several immunoassays to screen donated blood for transfusion-transmissible syphilis: Captia and MicroTrak brands (<http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=TRIB.OQ>). The Captia Syphilis-G is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to _T. pallidum_ in serum specimens. The MicroTrak syphilis assay uses preserved chicken red cells coated with antigens of _T. pallidum_, which will bind with specific antibody present in patient's serum or plasma. MicroTrak Syphilis is not available in the US.We are not told in the news reports above which Trinity Biotech product was judged insufficiently sensitive, whether this Trinity Biotech product has been recalled, or what product is being used in its place. Most likely the Trinity Biotech product involved is the MicroTrak Syphilis assay, because the Swiss recalled this product on 29 Sep 2016 (<https://www.swissmedic.ch/rueckrufe_medizinprodukte/index.html?lang=en>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.]
