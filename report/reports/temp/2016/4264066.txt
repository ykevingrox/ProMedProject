Swedish Medical Center, which fired him in January [2016], has offered free testing to about 3000 patients for HIV, and hepatitis C and B. So far 2500 have tested negative.Colorado health officials want anyone who had surgery at the hospital between 17 Aug 2015 and 22 Jan 2016 to be tested.Officials said at least 1000 former patients should be tested.""The absence of such evidence is not proof that no disease transmission occurred, because not all notified patients chose to be tested,"" said Dr. Larry Wolk, Colorado Department of Public Health's chief medical officer.[The former surgical technician's] HIV test results were revealed on the same day public health officials found serious problems with how Swedish Medical Center kept track of medication, practiced infection control or surgical services. The hospital has said it has a plan to correct the issues.[Byline: Shawn Price]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Additional information on this situation from KSL.com (<http://www.ksl.com/?sid=40026092&nid=157&title=hiv-positive-surgery-tech-has-history-of-stealing-drugs>):""The prosecutors allege that [the former surgical technician] was fired from at least 3 hospitals in as many states, but that didn't prevent him from landing a job in August [2015] at Swedish Medical Center in suburban Denver, where he is accused of taking a syringe of painkillers and replacing it with one containing another substance.""A class-action lawsuit filed in March [2016] on behalf of 3 patients who had surgery at Swedish claims hospital officials should have known about [the former technician's] 'suspicious employment history' and his alleged drug abuse before they hired him.""'All the warning signs of what would later occur at SMC were present,' the lawsuit states.""[The former technician] had been fired from hospitals in Arizona, California and Washington [state, USA] before he moved to Colorado. He also had drug problems when he served in the Navy and was court-martialed in 2011 for stealing pain medication, military records show.""According to the lawsuit, those records would have been released if Swedish requested them as part of a background check or to inquire about his military service.""It wasn't immediately known what steps the hospitals took to investigate his past, but prosecutors say he lied about his previous drug problems when he applied for the job at Swedish.""Hospital spokeswoman Nicole Williams said Wednesday night [1 Jun 2016], she could not comment about the lawsuit, but 'our background checks are in line with other (health care) organizations.'""Richard McCune, who is among the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, said Wednesday that he and the plaintiffs are also frustrated it took so long to find out that [the former technician] is HIV positive -- and that he 1st heard about it through a news story forwarded to him by a friend.""'For it to come out in a public forum, it doesn't endear a lot of confidence in (Swedish Medical Center) handling this in an objective way,' he said.""Before Wednesday, authorities had not described his health status, and prosecutors previously only referred to him as having an undisclosed 'blood-borne pathogen.' He had tested negative for hepatitis B and C, a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office also said.""The fear is that he may have replaced the needles intended for patients with syringes he previously used, making it possible for patients to be infected. However, his public defender has said that while evidence showed [the former technician] may have switched syringes, there was no reason to believe he was re-using them.""Public health officials have said the risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens is low, and there have been no reported cases of patients becoming infected because of [the former technician].""Authorities say someone saw him take a syringe filled with painkillers from an operating room at Swedish on 22 Jan 2016. The hospital fired him, and 3 weeks later federal prosecutors charged him with tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit.""Swedish Medical Center officials attempted to notify about 3000 patients who underwent surgery in the hospital's main operating room during his employment.""Dr. Larry Wolk, chief medical officer and executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said Wednesday that complete test results were not obtained for about 1000 patients. While the department said no evidence of transmission was found in those for whom testing was completed, it could not confirm that no diseases were passed on because testing was incomplete."" [Byline: Thomas Peipert, Associated Press] This situation that may have put patients at risk of infection with HIV is clearly a result of Swedish Medical Center not having conducted a thorough background check, or not having been able to get a full response back from sources for fear of a lawsuit.A map of Colorado, United States may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209>. - Mod.LK]******[2] HIV - India transfusionDate: Tue 31 May 2016Source: BBC [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36417789>India hospital transfusions infect thousands with HIV-----------------------------------------------------At least 2234 Indians have contracted HIV while receiving blood transfusions in hospitals in the past 17 months alone, say officials.The information was revealed by the country's National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) in response to a petition filed by information activist Chetan Kothari.Mr Khothari told the BBC that he was ""shocked"" by the revelation.India has more than 2M people living with HIV/AIDS.The highest number of patients who had been infected with HIV as a result of contaminated blood in hospitals, were from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh with 361 cases, Mr Kothari's RTI (Right to Information) query revealed.The western states of Gujarat with 292 cases and Maharashtra with 276 cases rank 2nd and 3rd respectively.The Indian capital Delhi is at number 4 with 264 cases.""This is the official data, provided by the government-run Naco. I believe the real numbers would be double or triple that,"" Mr Kothari told the BBC.Under law, it is mandatory for hospitals to screen donors and the donated blood for HIV, hepatitis B and C, malaria and other infections.""But each such test costs 1200 rupees (USD 18) and most hospitals in India do not have the testing facilities. Even in a big city like Mumbai, only 3 private hospitals have HIV testing facilities. Even the largest government hospitals do not have the technology to screen blood for HIV,"" Mr Kothari said.""This is a very serious matter and must be addressed urgently,"" he added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[This is a very serious situation. It is important for India to initiate screening of the blood supply.Despite being home to the world's 3rd-largest population suffering from HIV/AIDS (with South Africa and Nigeria having more), the AIDS prevalence rate in India is lower than in many other countries. In 2014, India's AIDS prevalence rate stood at approximately 0.26 percent -- the 90th highest in the world. The spread of HIV in India is primarily restricted to the southern and north-eastern regions of the country and India has also been praised for its extensive anti-AIDS campaign. The USD 2.5 billion National AIDS Control Plan III was set up by India in 2007 and received support from UNAIDS. The main factors which have contributed to India's large HIV-infected population are extensive labor migration and low literacy levels in certain rural areas resulting in lack of awareness and gender disparity. The Government of India has also raised concerns about the role of intravenous drug use and prostitution in spreading AIDS, especially in north-east India and certain urban pockets (from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_India>).A map of India may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>. - Mod.LK]
