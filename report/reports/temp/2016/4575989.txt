News24 [edited]<http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Local/South-Coast-Fever/rash-water-related-or-outbreak-20161019>Many people are complaining about an itchy rash which is suspected to be related to the recent water issues the South Coast has been experiencing. People say the rash started just after the South Coast experienced a high salt content in its water during the drought. The rash starts with a small itchy bump, then later spreads all over the body. Residents say going to the clinic does not help as the only treatment that is given are allergy creams or Calamine lotion. The reason why many suspect that the rash is water related is because people from different areas complain about the same thing, not just in one neighborhood.Thabsile Ngcobo of Department of Health said no reports of an outbreak have been circulated by the department. However, an email has been sent to local clinics to get confirmation about the number of walk-in patients who complain about the rash. ""At the moment we do not have official reports of an outbreak, however, the department will follow up,"" said Ngcobo.Ugu District Municipality was contacted for comment on allegations that the rash could be caused by the water. Ugu spokesperson France Zama said it is the municipality's view that water is life and as a caring water services authority, Ugu continues to provide communities with safe water that is in compliance with the South African National Drinking Standards (SANS 241).""The areas where the complaints come from are supplied by different sources. The Gamalakhe area is supplied from the Boboyi Plant, Mthwalume is supplied from Mthwalume Plant while St Faiths is supplied from the Mhlabatshane Plant. It is therefore highly unlikely that the alleged rash is as a result of our water.""Zama said the municipality undergoes a water testing process by an independent body that monitors the quality of Ugu water daily. There have not been any health hazards reported from their sources of supply.[Byline: Precious Gumede]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of people affected, the attack rate and an ""epidemic curve"" of cases/day over the time period are not given in the post; nor is whether the affected individuals all took showers or baths, how the rash is characterized and whether culturable pustules developed. That the areas affected draw water from different sources speaks against water being the vehicle.Much more information is needed to theorize a cause.Ugu (<https://www.google.com/#q=ugu>) is one of the 11 districts of KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Ugu is Zulu for ""coast"". - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3709>.]
