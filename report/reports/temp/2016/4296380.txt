This will include referral to health clinics.In addition, 8 water points and 8 latrines will be constructed and Water Sanitation and Hygiene committees established to ensure their maintenance, and 60 portable hand-washing points will be established, intended to improve access to health and WASH information. Additionally, 60 portable hand-washing points will be established, intended to improve access to health and WASH information and services, in order to engender behavior change and prevent the spread of Ebola and prevalent diseases.][This is exactly what should be done to engage youth in the community in efforts to control infectious diseases. - Mod.LK]14 Jun 2016 Liberia: Liberia after Ebola: Turning midwives into surgeons<http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/thecure/2016/06/liberia-ebola-turning-midwives-surgeons-160606141205329.html>[Prior to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014 in Liberia, the country had a total of 50 doctors for its population of 4.3 million. In comparison, there are 50 doctors available to every 100 000 people in the USA. This, combined with Liberia's extremely high maternal mortality rate, with 3 women dying every day, mean the health system is highly compromised under the strain.Many deaths would be preventable with simple surgery and adequate equipment. A chronic lack of doctors, however, means that many maternity wards are overstretched and understaffed. To meet the shortage of doctors, in a process called ""task-shifting,"" Liberian midwives are being trained as surgeons to assume the role of maternal health doctors killed by Ebola.Video, in English, about this effort to replace the ""missing doctors"" will be available on 25 Jul 2016.][This is an excellent approach to cover the loss of so many doctors during the outbreak. It will serve the population well. - Mod.LK]16 Jun 2016: Liberia under high surveillance despite Ebola-free status<http://africa.tvcnews.tv/2016/06/17/liberia-high-surveillance-despite-ebola-free-status/>[The World Health Organization (WHO) has placed Liberia under a 90-day period of heightened surveillance after being declared Ebola-free for the 4th time since a 2013 outbreak in West Africa.

The drug is among the relief goods to be procured through the Japanese government under its emergency grant aid program for the West African country, the company said.] [In 2014, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that Japan can offer favipiravir, developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm Holdings Corp., at any time at the request of the World Health Organization. The drug, with the brand name Avigan, was developed by Fujifilm subsidiary Toyama Chemical Co. to treat new and re-emerging influenza viruses and has not been proven to be effective against Ebola.Favipiravir was approved by Japan's health ministry in March [2016] for use against influenza. Fujifilm is in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on clinical testing of the drug in treating Ebola, company spokesman Takao Aoki said.Fabipiravir, a Japanese-developed anti-influenza drug, is a potential treatment to fight the rapidly expanding Ebola outbreak. He said Ebola and influenza viruses are the same general type, and a similar response can theoretically be expected from Ebola.Favipiravir inhibits viral gene replication within infected cells to prevent propagation, while other anti-viral drugs often are designed to inhibit the release of new viral particles to prevent the spread of infection, the company said (<http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-outbreak-japan-offers-anti-influenza-drug-for-treatment-1.2745915>).

The 2 were charged with embezzlement of 529 million GNF, [USD 71 986], granted by the World Health Organization. The funds were meant for educating traditional healers on the dangers of the Ebola virus. The trial followed a complaint lodged by the federation of traditional healers of Guinea against the National Ebola Coordination Committee in 2015.]17 Jun 2016: Doctors Without Borders rejects EU [European Union] funds<http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/money/doctors-without-borders-rejects-eu-funds/25722535>[Doctors Without Borders has stated it will no longer accept funds from the European Union (EU) because of its ""dangerous migration policies."" The decision comes after the EU and Turkish officials made a controversial deal to send anyone who crosses into Greece illegally back to Turkey. The plan was agreed upon in March 2016 as Europe tries to respond to the largest migration crisis since World War II.In a statement, the nongovernmental organization, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said, ""On the Greek Islands, more than 8000 people, including hundreds of unaccompanied minors, have been stranded as a direct consequence of the EU-Turkey deal.""The decision, which takes effect immediately, is... ""in opposition to (the EU's) damaging deterrence policies and continued attempts to push people and their suffering away from European shores. The EU-Turkey deal sets a dangerous precedent for other countries hosting refugees, sending a message that caring for people forced from their homes is optional and that they can buy their way out of providing asylum.""Jerome Oberreit, MSF's international secretary general, told a press conference: ""This is really about Europe's refugee shame.""In 2015, MSF received Euro 56 million (USD 63 million) from the EU and its member states. MSF has said it will use its reserve funds to ensure the decision will not impact any patients. MSF noted its funding from the EU makes up only a small proportion of their overall budget, as 92 percent of their funds are received from individual donors.""]Research------13 Jun 2016: Ebola, Zika can be predicted using environmental changes: Study<http://www.financialexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/ebola-zika-can-be-predicted-using-environmental-changes-study/283023/>[Researchers used the locations of 408 known Lassa fever outbreaks in West Africa between 1967-2012 and the changes in land use and crop yields, temperature and rainfall, behavior, and access to healthcare, to successfully develop a model that can predict the outbreak of zoonotic diseases, such as [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] and [Zika virus disease (ZIKV)].According to Kate Jones from the University College London (UCL) in the UK, ""This model is a major improvement in our understanding of the spread of diseases from animals to people. We hope it can be used to help communities prepare and respond to disease outbreaks, as well as to make decisions about environmental change factors that may be within their control.""][The research was published on Mon 13 Jun 2016 in Methods in Ecology and Evolution:Citation.DW Redding et al.
