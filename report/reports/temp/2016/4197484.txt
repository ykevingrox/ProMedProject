At the moment 13 people have died of the disease, while more cases are still admitted at the health facilities.In a phone interview, the District Health Officer (DHO) of Butaleja district Dr John Matovu says they have so far registered 194 victims and 7 deaths. He explained that 5 victims died in health facilities while the other 2 died in their homes. He however added that most of patients have been discharged from the hospital wards. ""At the moment we have 3 patients and the rest have been discharged after showing signs of improvement.""The Director General of Health Services at the ministry of health Dr Ruth Aceng has asked the district officials to increase cholera surveillance due to the ongoing heavy rains and to intensify health education and awareness campaigns more so the use of pit latrines. She says Busia, Sironko, and Kibuku have also reported some cases too. Aceng said the country is currently experiencing heavy rains which are likely to bring in floods in certain districts and this may lead to spread of the outbreak to some parts of the country.The DHO of Namayingo Dr Patrick Magoola says by Wed 26 Apr 2016, the district had registered 114 cases and 6 people reported to have died.[Byline: Violet Nabatanzi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - Uganda (Eastern Region)Date: Sun 1 May 2016Source: The Monitor [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201605020954.html>To date, 3 people have been confirmed dead of suspected cholera at Bwondha Landing Site in Malongo Sub-county in Mayuge District [Eastern Region]. Dr Charles Nabangi, the district health officer, said on Thu 28 Apr 2016, the disease had claimed 3 people in one week and more than 18 were admitted to various health centres. The majority of the victims were rushed to Malongo Health Centre III.""I started feeling abdominal pains after taking water and within a short time, I started vomiting and developed diarrhoea,"" one of the patients, told Sunday Monitor at her bed at Malongo Health Centre.Health officials at the hospital said most of the patients were vomiting and had diarrhea.However, Dr Nabangi said they had not yet confirmed whether it was cholera. ""The disease is associated with vomiting and diarrhea and we have sent samples to Kampala to establish whether it is cholera or any other disease,"" Dr Nabangi said. He said the disease is caused by poor sanitation and accused households of lacking latrines. He said 30 per cent of households in the district lack pit latrines and discharge human waste into the bush and nearby Lake Victoria, where they also draw water for domestic use.A press statement from the director of health services, Dr Jane Ruth Acheng, yesterday [30 Apr 2016] said the eastern districts have reported cholera cases with Namayingo and Butaleja, the most affected, recording at least 4 cases daily. She said the neighboring districts of Busia, Sironko, and Kibuku have also reported cases of cholera, which she attributed to poor hygiene and sanitation worsened by the rains.Dr Acheng appealed to the residents to boil or chlorinate all drinking water, intensify health inspection in all communities, intensify health education and awareness, and enforce construction of pit-latrines[Byline: Yazid Yolisigira]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Uganda can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97 >. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] Cholera - Zambia (Southern Province)Date: Mon 2 May 2016Source: Lusaka Times [edited]<https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/05/02/cholera-cases-increase-monze/>The international labor day [1 May 2016] celebrations in Monze (Southern Province) have been postponed following the outbreak of cholera which has since claimed 2 lives in some parts of the district. Cholera cases in Monze District have risen from 28 last week[week of 25 Apr 2016] to 42 since the disease broke out a week ago.In an interview with ZANIS [Zambia News and Information Services], Monze District Administrative Officer Gorreti Bbalo said the labor day preparations committee decided to postpone the event after health authorities advised against holding public gatherings. This is in order to help prevent the spread of the disease.""As a committee, we decided to postpone the event to a later date because of the outbreak of cholera and we just hope the health authorities will contain the disease as soon as possible so that we can hold the event,"" said Ms. Bbalo.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Zambia can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zambia_pol01.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/15078>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[4] Cholera - Kenya (Narok County)Date: Mon 2 May 2016Source: Standard Digital [edited]<http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000200276/alarm-in-narok-as-cholera-case-confirmed>A cholera case has been confirmed in Narok [County in south west Kenya]. This was revealed during a multi-sectoral cholera management meeting at Narok Referral Hospital. The meeting was aimed at devising strategies to combat the outbreak.County Director of Health Services Francis Kiio said the 1st case of cholera was confirmed at the facility after specimens from a patient who was admitted with cholera symptoms tested positive. Dr Kiio said the patient, who hails from Narok town, was admitted at the referral hospital with cholera-like symptoms and was confirmed positive after samples were taken to National Public Health Laboratory in Nairobi. He said the patient had travelled to Wajir East [in north east Kenya] where there was an outbreak.The confirmation of this case now puts Narok County on the list of over 10 counties in the country that are grappling with the disease.County Public Health Officer Daniel Sironka said with the outbreak being reported in neighboring Nakuru, Kisii, Migori, and Garissa, they were tackling the spread by discouraging open defecation.[Byline: Robert Kiplagat]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Kenya can be seen at <http://softkenya.com/county/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2015/05/Counties-in-Kenya.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11462>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThe mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
