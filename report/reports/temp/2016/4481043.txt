(11 Aug 2016). After Ebola in West Africa -- Unpredictable Risks, Preventable Epidemics. N Engl J Med 2016; 375:587-596. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMsr1513109Summary.Between December 2013 and April 2016, the largest epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to date generated more than 28 000 cases and more than 11 000 deaths in the large, mobile populations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Tracking the rapid rise and slower decline of the West African epidemic has reinforced some common understandings about the epidemiology and control of EVD but has also generated new insights. Despite having more information about the geographic distribution of the disease, the risk of human infection from animals and from survivors of EVD remains unpredictable over a wide area of equatorial Africa. Until human exposure to infection can be anticipated or avoided, future outbreaks will have to be managed with the classic approach to EVD control, extensive surveillance, rapid detection and diagnosis, comprehensive tracing of contacts, prompt patient isolation, supportive clinical care, rigorous efforts to prevent and control infection, safe and dignified burial, and engagement of the community. Empirical and modeling studies conducted during the West African epidemic have shown that large epidemics of EVD are preventable; a rapid response can interrupt transmission and restrict the size of outbreaks, even in densely populated cities. The critical question now is how to ensure that populations and their health services are ready for the next outbreak, wherever it may occur. Health security across Africa and beyond depends on committing resources to both strengthen national health systems and sustain investment in the next generation of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics.]7 Sep 2016: Spatiotemporal dynamics of the Ebola epidemic in Guinea and implications for vaccination and disease elimination: a computational modeling analysis <http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-016-0678-3>[Citation.Ajelli M, Merler S, Fumanelli L, et al.

Critical Care Medicine, 43 (10). <http://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000001197>Abstract.This report describes 3 patients with Ebola virus disease who were treated in the United States and developed for severe critical illness and multiple organ failure secondary to Ebola virus infection. The patients received mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, invasive monitoring, vasopressor support, and investigational therapies for Ebola virus disease. ...-moreConclusion: In the severe form, patients with Ebola virus disease may require life-sustaining therapy, including mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. In conjunction with other reported cases, this series suggests that respiratory and renal failure may occur in severe Ebola virus disease, especially in patients burdened with high viral loads. Ebola virus disease complicated by multiple organ failure can be survivable with the application of advanced life support measures. This collective, multicenter experience is presented with the hope that it may inform future treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease requiring critical care treatment.]8 Sep 2016: Trojan Horse Might Take Ebola by Surprise--Bi-specific antibody complexes show promise in early study<http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/Ebola/60105>[In early research, the ""Trojan horse"" antibodies were effective in preventing all 5 varieties of Ebola from infecting human cells, according to Kartik Chandran, PhD, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, and colleagues.The approach protected mice from a lethal dose of the Zaire Ebola virus, the variety responsible for the recent African outbreak.Citation.Wec AZ, Nyakatura EK, Herbert AS, et al. 8 Sep 2016. A ""Trojan horse"" bispecific antibody strategy for broad protection against ebolaviruses. Science 8 Sep 2016, DOI: 10.1126/science.aag3267Abstract.There is an urgent need for monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies that broadly protect against Ebola virus and other filoviruses. The conserved, essential interaction between the filovirus glycoprotein, GP, and its entry receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides an attractive target for such mAbs, but is shielded by multiple mechanisms, including physical sequestration in late endosomes. Here, we describe a bispecific antibody strategy to target this interaction, in which mAbs specific for NPC1 or the GP receptor-binding site are coupled to a mAb against a conserved, surface-exposed GP epitope. Bispecific antibodies, but not parent mAbs, neutralized all known ebolaviruses by coopting viral particles themselves for endosomal delivery, and conferred post-exposure protection against multiple ebolaviruses in mice. Such ""Trojan horse"" bispecific antibodies have potential as broad anti-filovirus immunotherapeutics.]9 Sep 2016: Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27298074>[Citation.Petrie KJ, Faasse K, Thomas M.

This includes USD 223 million from the African Development Fund (ADF), Transitional Support Fund (TSF), and the Special Relief Fund (SRF) aimed at strengthening health systems, training health workers, and providing equipment and other emergency support to Ebola-affected countries, and USD 300 million for a road transport project for the Mano River Union countries aimed at strengthening infrastructure and the economy in the region.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>. -
