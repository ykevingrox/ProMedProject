In severe cases, patients can come down with other complications such as meningoencephalitis or myocarditis and may even result in death.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[HFMD caused by coxsackie virus A16 infection is a mild disease and nearly all patients recover within 7-10 days. Complications are uncommon. HFMD caused by enterovirus EV71 may be associated with neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis.Cases of fatal encephalitis, which occurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in Taiwan in 1998, were caused by EV71.
