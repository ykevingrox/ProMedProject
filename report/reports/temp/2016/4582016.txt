The local health unit has offered antibiotic prophylaxis to all possible contacts.The case is particularly worrying because the young man had been recently vaccinated against _N. meningitis_ type C in the campaign set up by the Tuscany Region in an effort to curb the meningitis morbidity peak, which reached 31 cases in 2015 and 23 so far in 2016. The present case is the 10th that has occurred in vaccinated people, which raises doubts on the protective efficacy of the vaccine.[La Repubblica also reported that] Rino Rappuoli, credited as the developer of the conjugated vaccine, pointed out in an interview with the newspaper that 7 of the 10 cases had been vaccinated more than 5 years earlier and suggested that a recall could be advisable every 5 years [2].[1.

When last reported by ProMED-mail in March 2016, there were a total of 43 cases; 18 of the 43 patients had sepsis only; 14 had sepsis and meningitis; 11 had meningitis only; 10 patients died; there were no secondary cases; and 35 of the 43 strains belonged to C:P1.5-1,10-8:F3-6:ST-11(cc11) (1). (Meningococcal serogroup C cc11 strains are known to cause invasive disease burden worldwide and are responsible for high mortality rates among cases.) The median age of the 43 cases in the Tuscany outbreak was 28 years (range: 9-82); 18 of the 43 cases were over 30 years old, and 11 were over 55 years old.Meningococcal conjugate vaccines (in which bacterial polysaccharide is conjugated to a protein carrier) have several advantages over polysaccharide vaccines, including the ability to induce greater antibody persistence, avidity, immunologic memory, reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci, and herd immunity, but protection induced by meningococcal vaccines is strictly serotype-specific. Meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccine was introduced in the Tuscany regional immunization schedule in 2005, with 3 doses to all children at 3, 5, and 13 months of age, and at the national level, MCC was introduced in 2012.The effectiveness of MCC vaccination given in infancy has been found to wane in UK studies after one year, but the numbers of cases of serogroup C disease in the population remained low (2,3) as a consequence of a reduction in the prevalence of serogroup C nasopharyngeal carriage after vaccination leading to high levels of herd protection (4). If herd protection wanes, many children may become vulnerable to infection (5). However, cohorts vaccinated at older ages seem to have greater and longer-lasting protection than those routinely vaccinated in infancy in the UK study. Prompted by the serogroup C outbreak, health officials promoted an MCC vaccination campaign in 2015 in adolescents and adults in the area where serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ disease was reported 2015, which was extended to the whole Tuscany Region and to the elderly in 2016.1.
