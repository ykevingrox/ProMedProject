WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/29-march-2016-yellow-fever-china/en/>Yellow fever -- China---------------------On 13 Mar 2016, the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point of China notified WHO of an imported case of yellow fever virus infection. The case is a 32-year-old Chinese male, who works in Luanda, Angola. The patient reported fever and chills on 8 Mar [2016]. He travelled from Luanda to China, arriving in Beijing on 10 Mar 2016. He immediately visited a hospital in Beijing. On 11 Mar 2016, the patient tested positive for yellow fever virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On 12 Mar 2016, laboratory results were confirmed by China CDC. Currently, the patient is in critical condition with liver and kidney dysfunction. He did not receive vaccination against yellow fever prior to symptom onset.Public health response----------------------The Chinese government has strengthened surveillance and vector monitoring, and carried out vector control and risk communication activities.WHO risk assessment-------------------This is the 1st imported case of yellow fever to China. The risk for further transmission is considered to be minimal as it is not the active season for the competent vector [mosquito], _Aedes aegypti_, in Beijing and the current temperatures (around 10 deg C/50 deg F) are not favourable for an increase in vector density. [ProMED was not aware that _Ae. aegypti_ had been recorded from Beijing].WHO advice----------This report of yellow fever infection in a previously non-immunised traveller returning from a country where vaccination against the disease is mandatory underlines the need to reinforce the implementation of vaccination requirements, in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). Therefore, WHO urges Members States, especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible, (that is, where the competent vector, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is present) to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] WHO Angola: RFIDate: 14 Mar 2016 [ProMED regrets the delay in posting]Subject: WHO Situation Report (SITREP), yellow fever outbreak in Angola [edited]<http://www.afro.who.int/en/yellow-fever/sitreps/item/8440-sitrep-yellow-fever-outbreak-in-angola-14-march-2016.html>[This report traces the early development of the epidemic with a graph, tables, and maps. It recorded a slower advance in one heavily vaccinated district, and said survey results would be available on 16 Mar 2016, and a weekly press release, but we have not been able to trace them. Can anyone help us find them?Community level investigation found that many cases and deaths of fever with jaundice had not been detected by the surveillance system, and there are a lot of other details.Note that Angola reported 77 percent coverage of target children with yellow fever vaccine in 2014<http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/coverages?c=AGO>. - Mod.JW]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*******[3] Bednets for preventionDate: Tue 29 Mar 2016From: David Thomson <dthomson@naqia.gov.pg> [edited]1. _Aedes aegypti_ is a predominantly day-biting mosquito. Insecticide impregnated nets may not be as effective as residual treatment of dwellings combined with clean up of man-made containers of standing water.[True -- but their use will reduce the burden on the health services of malaria and other diseases carried by night-biting mosquitoes, and if left down during the day, instead of rolled up, will provide large insecticidal areas on which _Ae. aegypti_ could rest during the day and die from the exposure just as much as if they had rested on the walls. - Mod.JWBed nets may be helpful in avoiding mosquitoes feeding on febrile (and viremic) patients who are likely to be in bed during the day, when vector mosquitoes are active. - Mod.TY] 2. We appear to have seen almost as many exported cases from this outbreak in a month, notably to relatively high-risk onward transmission destinations (and similarly by unvaccinated persons) as were observed from the much larger recent west African Ebola outbreak affecting [many] countries. Ebola is contact transmissible, [with] no vaccination [then available], but some minority residual seropositivity and perhaps partial immunity in the west African outbreak population. Yellow fever is vector-borne, [with] good vaccines, but vaccination status and/or residual immunity of the affected population ill-defined.Is the apparent disparity in exported cases from the current YF outbreak a factor of differences in the internationally mobile expatriate worker demographics relative to West Africa, or a factor of different approaches being taken to pre-departure screening and control for this outbreak at the source?--Dr David ThomsonGeneral Manager OperationsNational Agriculture Quarantine & Inspection AuthorityPapua New Guinea<dthomson@naqia.gov.pg>[Travelers departing from yellow fever endemic or epidemic countries are not required to undergo pre-departure screening and control, only on arrival at their final destination. Unfortunately, arrival screening with thermal body scanners is ineffective and can be circumvented by taking fever-reducing medication; responses to questions about countries of departure can be unreliable; contact tracing information can be falsified; and requests to inform local health authorities of any fever in the days following arrival can be ignored. However, perhaps instituting these measures to allay public anxiety and reduce the risk to some extent is justified in the circumstances. There is also the problem of the sale of fake vaccination cards to unvaccinated travelers (and residents), and the use of fake or expired vaccine. - Mod.JW]******[4] Case fatality rate: correctionDate: Tue 29 Mar 2016From: Jack Woodall <woodall@promedmail.org> [edited]The revised International Health Regulations (2005) require travellers ***to or [as well as]*** from endemic countries, to carry a ***valid*** vaccination certificate. ""Travellers, particularly those arriving to Asia from Africa or Latin America must have a certificate of yellow fever vaccination.""(<http://www.who.int/csr/don/22-march-2016-yellow-fever-angola/en>).""According to WHO, there are between 84 000 and 170 000 cases of yellow fever a year and as many as 60 000 of those cases are fatal.""(<http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/25/health/yellow-fever-vaccine-shortage-angola>) That is, a CFR of 35-70 percent).I hate being alarmist, but I was spooked by the line in CCDM 20th edn. ""The overall case fatality rate is 20-50 percent,"" -- see ProMED post Yellow fever - countries with dengue: alert 20160328.4123983 (and guess which figure the unscientific media will run with)?BUT I was overly apocalyptic using those figures. ""The majority of persons infected with yellow fever virus have no illness or only mild illness. Most persons improve after the initial presentation. After a brief remission of hours to a day, roughly 15 percent of cases progress to develop a more severe form of the disease. The severe form is characterized by high fever, jaundice, bleeding, and eventually shock and failure of multiple organs."" (CDC 2015) <http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/symptoms>.Ambiguous wording -- NOT ""overall"" CFR 20-50 percent, but 20-50 percent of the most severe 15 percent of the approx. 20 percent of those diagnosed clinically, if Zika is any guide. It is estimated 73 percent of people on Yap island in the Pacific were infected with the closely related flavivirus Zika in the 2007 virgin soil outbreak.So I'm estimating that ""if"" the mortality rate (based on the total population at risk) -- as opposed to the CFR (based on clinical case numbers) -- were to be as high as 1 percent of a country's total at-risk population, there ""might"" be a low estimate of more than a million deaths in China alone and 6.5 million in the whole of at-risk Asia. (Note the words in quotes). Then there would be Africa, Latin America and the rest of the world. The demand for vaccine would be astronomical, as I am sure big pharma has already calculated.Also note that WHO will be under pressure _not_ to declare a PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern), because of the inevitable economic damage to trade and tourism that would follow, as it did for Ebola in West Africa, and the ridicule it underwent for its alert for an influenza pandemic that never came to pass. But it could call an urgent expert consultation and promulgate its blueprint for national contingency plans. (I was a staff member of WHO from 1981-94, and a WHO expert consultant on yellow fever in 2013).--John P ""Jack"" Woodall, PhDCo-founder & Associate Editor, ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[When to declare a public health emergency poses a real dilemma for the WHO and national health agencies. If they do not declare one, and the outbreak gets out of hand early on (as Ebola disease in West Africa did at first), they are justifiably criticized and face a more serious situation. If they do declare an emergency and no serious outbreak develops, they are criticized for overreacting and the countries under alert may suffer significant economic losses and social problems. However, even in the absence of a declared emergency, preparation of contingency plans by national and international public health agencies can be put in place, so that actions can be implemented quickly to contain an outbreak should it appear.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TYDengue map (countries currently at-risk from YF): <http://www.healthmap.org/dengue/en> - Mod.JW]
