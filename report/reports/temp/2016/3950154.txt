Citi FM Online [edited]<http://citifmonline.com/2016/01/19/pneumococcal-meningitis-outbreak-in-ba-contained-health-ministry-audio/>The pneumococcal meningitis outbreak has so far killed 15 people in the Tain, Wenchi, Techiman and Bruohan districts in the Brong Ahafo Region. Speaking on the Citi Breakfast Show, Dr Bampoe said visits to the 3 Northern regions and the Brong Ahafo region [had] revealed [that] about 55 people had been affected with meningitis with slightly over 19 fatalities as of Friday last week [15 Jan 2016].The deputy health minister, however, said health officials were on top of the situation. ""... It is nothing to worry about because the district health teams, the regional health management teams, and the district assemblies are very much in control,"" he stated. According to Dr Bampoe, it remains unclear why pneumococcal meningitis is spreading quickly in the districts in the Brong Ahafo region, but he said that the focus of health officials at the moment is on keeping the disease from spreading further.Dr Bampoe also indicated that the outbreak of the disease is being treated as an epidemic but said there was no need for panic, as health officials were working to curtail the spread of this pneumococcal meningitis strain. ""There is no need for fear and panic. It's very well in hand, and we have to trust to the systems we have set up to deal with it,"" he said.[byline: Delali Adogla-Bessa]--communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Ghana can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Ghana.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/50377>. Tain, Techiman, and Wenchi, where the pneumococcal meningitis outbreak is occurring, are 3 of the 22 districts in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brong-Ahafo_Region>).Since the last ProMED-mail post on this outbreak 2 weeks ago, the number of cases has risen from 30 to 55, and the number of deaths from 8 to ""slightly over 19"".A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine could be beneficial. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce carriage of serotypes of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ contained in the vaccine and thus person-to-person transmission of these pathogens, which occurs by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. However, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was found to include serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) protective against only 8 per cent of the isolates in one study in Burkina Faso (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.full>). The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar 13, which covers serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, may be more effective, but we are not told the serotypes of pneumococci causing this outbreak in Ghana.Information from knowledgeable sources in regard to the serotypes of _S. pneumoniae_ involved in this outbreak in Ghana would be welcomed. - Mod.ML]
