The Nation Online (Nigeria) [edited]<http://thenationonlineng.net/confirms-nigerias-third-polio-case/>Nigeria has reported its 3rd polio case in the northeastern state of Borno, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday [5 Sep 2016], warning more cases could appear in a major health setback.Two other polio cases were reported in August [2016, see prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below - Mod.MPP].Nigeria was on track to be certified free of the virus next year [2017].""A 3rd child has been paralyzed by wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) in Borno state,"" WHO said in a statement.""It's all linked to the same outbreak,"" WHO said, adding: ""detection of new cases is not unexpected and can be anticipated, particularly as disease surveillance is being strengthened, including by conducting retrospective case searches.""The 3 cases appear to come from the same strain of the disease [virus] circulating in the northeast for years, said Stephanie Mucznik, spokesperson for Rotary International, which is working with the Nigerian government to eradicate polio.Mucznik said the latest case concerned a 2-year-old boy suffering from the onset of paralysis on [6 Aug 2016] in the Monguno area.""Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses suggests they are most closely linked to WPV1 last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection since that time,"" Mucznik said.Polio is a highly infectious viral disease which mainly affects young children and can result in permanent paralysis. There is no cure, and it can only be prevented through immunisation.Nigeria's outbreak response, which includes a large immunisation campaign, is expected to continue until November [2016] and includes the neighbouring areas of Chad, Cameroon and Niger.Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole warned in August [2016] that the affected areas ""have had their health facilities destroyed by insurgents,"" and ""accessibility was a barrier to service provision.""Since taking up arms in 2009, Boko Haram Islamist militants have captured swathes of territory in the northeast, cutting off health services for millions of people. In the past year, the Nigerian military has recorded a series of successes against Boko Haram. But the northeast has been devastated by the fighting, with the United Nations estimating that this year [2016], 7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.[In an earlier version of this same article, the following commentary/information was provided: ""The campaign is expected to spread across the country, with a plan to reach 25 million children before the end of the year [2016]."" - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[On 25 Sep 2015, Nigeria was removed from the list of polio-endemic countries <http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/nigeria-polio/en/>. Nigeria was on its way to being declared polio-free in July 2017. However, with these emerging reports of polio cases in the northeastern part of the country, Nigeria has lost the chance to be declared polio-free. Activities of the Islamist militants Boko Haram have been blamed largely for this setback. There has been extreme resistance to vaccination activities in Borno due to extremist activity in the state and propaganda.A map of Nigeria showing states can be found at: <http://www.waado.org/images/Maps/nigeria2.gif>. Borno state is in the extreme northeast of the country, bordering Chad, Cameroon and Niger.

Given the findings that the genetic profile of the WPV1s involved in this outbreak are most closely related to WPV1s that had been circulating in the area 5 years ago (2011), it suggests that there has been ongoing low level circulation in these areas, and, now that there is access, it would not be surprising to identify more cases through intensive case finding in the area.A map of Borno state showing the locations of the districts can be found at: <http://thenigeriangazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BORNO-STATE-MAP.gif>. This current case is located in the Mongono area, in the southernmost portion of what is referred to as northern Borno State. The 2 cases reported in August 2016 were from Jere and Gwoza, suggesting more widespread circulation of the virus. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/621>.]
