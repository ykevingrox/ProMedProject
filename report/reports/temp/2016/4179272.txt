At the time of initial confirmation, classification was under investigation (although he was reported not to have had contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness). - Mod.MPP]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Cases continue to be reported, but fortunately at a much slower pace than in March 2016. In the past 7 days there have been 3 newly confirmed cases. Since the beginning of April 2016 there have been 13 newly confirmed cases, including 5 deaths, reported, of whom 7 of the cases were classified as primary cases (1 without a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset), 4 were classified as secondary cases (1 household contact, 2 healthcare acquired in patients and 1 healthcare acquired in a healthcare worker) and 2 were under investigation for possible high-risk exposures. Of the healthcare acquired cases in patients, 1 was in Buraidah (reported on 1 Apr 2016), 1 was in Riyadh.Of interest is the newly reported infection in an asymptomatic individual in Hufoof reported on 19 Apr 2016. There had been a newly confirmed case from Hufoof reported on 11 Apr 2016 who was classified as a primary case with known contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. One wonders if the asymptomatic infected individual was tested as a known close contact of the previously confirmed case, or if he was tested as a known close contact with the same group of camels the previously confirmed case had contact with. In either case, it seems to serve as further proof of camel-to-human transmission (for those naysayers out there).Locations of the newly reported cases and recoveries can be seen on maps available on the source URL pages. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia - WHO 22 Apr 2016Date: 22 Apr 2016Source: WHO Global Alert and Response, Disease Outbreak News (DON) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/22-april-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia----------------------------------------------------------------Between 1 and 15 Apr 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 10 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 3 deaths.Details of the cases1 - A 54 year old male from Najran city developed symptoms on 3 Apr 2016 and was admitted to a hospital on 12 Apr 2016.
