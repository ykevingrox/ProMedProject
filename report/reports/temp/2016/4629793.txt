The means of testing the virus quickly assisted in stopping its spread as well.Since then France in particular has poured money into ensuring Guinea, a former French colony, has adequate means to tackle deadly hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola.]7 Nov 2016 Sierra Leone: Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone<http://www.independent.mk/articles/38349/Ebola+Outbreaks+in+Sierra+Leone>[A young man sits silently and stares into the distance, he has tired of brushing his hair and an upright comb is tangled into the back of his curls. The 17-year-old speaks quietly, using few words in a calm and gentle manner, but people in his community are scared of him. They say he is crazy and fear what he might do next. A few days ago he was seen screaming and dancing on the spot, and not long before that he had dressed in his sister's clothes. Then, of course, there are the times when he sits alone and talks to himself in incoherent mumbles.This young man is just one of many Sierra Leoneans whose mental health suffered as a result of the Ebola virus and without the necessary support it has gradually deteriorated over the past year. Had the young man received any form of psychosocial support he might not have dropped out of school, nor would he be scared to leave the compound around his house.][Psychological and social support of individuals in families who have been affected by the Ebola outbreak are as important as attention to their physical health. Without such care, it will be difficult for the communities to fully recover. And see next report for more on problems encountered in the aftermath of the outbreak. - Mod.LK]7 Nov 2016 Sierra Leone: Ebola one year on: Sierra Leone's children are still suffering<http://www.christiantoday.com/article/ebola.one.year.on.sierra.leones.children.are.still.suffering/100013.htm>[A year ago today (7 Nov 2015), Sierra Leone was declared free from [Ebola virus disease (EVD)], but thousands of children orphaned by the virus are still suffering immense difficulties. 'M,' now 16 years old, lives in Freetown with her 2 younger brothers, aged 12 and 9. She became the head of her household when their parents both died after contracting [EVD]. After M's father died, she and her brothers were forced to leave the family home because the landlord was afraid of them passing on the disease, but they have since moved back. 'M' said she does petty trading to try and support both of her brothers through school but it is very hard to raise the money for fees, books, and uniforms. She also does all the cooking in the house. 'M' and her 2 brothers receive support from no one, not even the community. They have aunts and uncles but they don't care and they don't help 'M' and her 2 brothers. She says she wants to be somebody, to finish school, and to become a soldier. She also really wants her brothers to finish education and get well-paid jobs. 'M' said she and her brothers, and that they look after each other.'M' is just one of more than 12 000 children orphaned by Ebola, which killed more than 11 000 people in West Africa between 2014 and 2015.She and her brothers are now being helped by Street Child, but the NGO today warned that many others are still suffering alone.Of further concern is the high number of teen pregnancies, many of which occurred when young people were forced to exchange sex for food.Sierra Leone is also now suffering a food crisis. The price of a bag of rice -- a staple food in the country -- has more than doubled since 2014, while wages have stagnated. A report published last week (week of 1 Nov 2016) by UN food agencies and the Sierra Leone government warned that half the population -- more than 3.5 million people -- are facing food shortages.]Research / Correspondence-------------------------14 Nov 2016: Efficacy of convalescent plasma in relation to dose of Ebola virus antibodies<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1609116>[Citation:Van Griensven J, Edwards T, Baize S: Efficacy of convalescent plasma in relation to dose of Ebola virus antibodies. N Engl J Med 2016; doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1609116Letter to the editor [edited]:We previously reported the results of a nonrandomized, controlled trial that compared survival among patients with Ebola virus (EBOV) disease who were treated with convalescent plasma with survival among historical controls. Although no safety concerns were identified, efficacy was not shown (1). Notably, the levels of total anti-EBOV IgG and neutralizing antibodies in the infused plasma were unknown at the time of administration (1,2). We now report on the association between the amount of total anti-EBOV IgG and neutralizing antibodies received and patient survival and on the changes in the amount of EBOV in their blood 24 hours after transfusion, expressed as the change in the cycle-threshold value in the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) analysis ...moreIn conclusion, most patients received plasma with anti-EBOV IgG antibodies, but levels of neutralizing antibodies were low in many donations. The dose of IgG antibodies showed an association with larger increases in cycle-threshold values after transfusion but no significant association with mortality. Neither outcome showed an association with the estimated doses of neutralizing antibodies received. Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of an antibody dose higher than the doses used in this study, the antibody measure that best correlates with virologic and clinical outcomes, and the potential mechanism and clinical effect of viral clearance by anti-EBOV IgG antibodies.][See the URL above to read full letter and supplementary information. - Mod.LK]Funding-------10 Nov 2016: NCATS funds collaboration initiative aimed at repurposing antimalarial to combat Ebola virus<http://www.news-medical.net/news/20161110/NCATS-funds-collaboration-initiative-aimed-at-repurposing-antimalarial-to-combat-Ebola-virus.aspx>[The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) recently awarded USD 596 533 to Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPI) to initiate a partnership with Texas Biomedical Research Institute aimed at repurposing an antimalarial for use against the Ebola virus.According to the WHO (World Health Organization) statistics, since 2014, the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreak in West Africa has resulted in 28 657 suspected cases and 11 325 deaths, and has highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses.Data from a published large-scale high-throughput screen, performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute, was used to create machine learning models that identified 3 compounds active against the virus in vitro (in a lab, outside of a living organism). This earlier work had suggested that antimalarial compounds, as well as other classes of approved drugs, could be of interest for repurposing ...more]Economy-------10 Nov 2016 Sierra Leone: IMF staff complete review mission to Sierra Leone<http://www.thepatrioticvanguard.com/imf-staff-completes-review-mission-to-sierra-leone>[An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission led by John Wakeman-Linn visited Freetown, Sierra Leone, recently to conduct the 6th and final review under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).At the conclusion of the visit, Wakeman-Linn issued a statement indicating Sierra Leone's economic reforms over the last 3 years have been largely successful. The economy proved resilient in the face of 2 major exogenous shocks: the Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] epidemic and collapse of iron ore prices and associated loss of production in 2014-2015. Sound macroeconomic policies, together with generous support from development partners, helped ensure fiscal and external sustainability, while providing sufficient resources to begin implementing the post-Ebola Recovery Strategy. Since the last quarter of 2015, economic growth has resumed, and it remains on an upward trend, supported by new investments in mining, agriculture and fisheries. The recovery underway is projected to remain sustainable over the medium term. ...more[Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A
