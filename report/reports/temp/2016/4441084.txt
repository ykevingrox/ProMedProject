""I'd rather you not eat anything raw on my boat,"" said Warhurst. ""If you want to eat them raw you wait till you get to the dock and you're on your own."" Married to a nurse, Warhurst says he knows the dangers of eating raw or undercooked shellfish. ""Some people die from this stuff,"" he explained.According to the Florida Department of Health, 2 Tampa-area residents did get infected with _Vibrio vulnificus_ and died in 2016. One resident was from Citrus County, the other resided in Sarasota County. The bacterium occurs naturally in Gulf Coast waters. You can also get infected if you go into water with an open cut or sore.So far in 2016, 23 people have been infected by the bacterium across the USA. A total of 5 people have died from the infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The recent data on _V. vulnificus_ in Florida is:2008: 16 cases, 6 deaths2009: 24 cases, 7 deaths2010: 32 cases, 10 deaths2011: 35 cases, 13 deaths2012: 26 cases, 9 deaths2013: 41 cases, 12 deaths2014: 32 cases, 7 deaths2015: 45 cases, 14 deathsThere are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination); and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.]
