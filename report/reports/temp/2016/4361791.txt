She had headache and abdominal cramping while in the airport awaiting return to NYC. The following day (day 1) she developed fever, fatigue, a maculopapular rash, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, swelling of the extremities, and numbness and tingling in her hands and feet. In addition, on day 1, the woman began menses that she described as heavier than usual. On day 3 she visited her primary care provider who obtained blood and urine specimens. Zika virus RNA was detected in both serum and urine by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) performed at the DOHMH Public Health Laboratory using a test based on an assay developed at CDC. The results of serum testing for anti-Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody performed by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center laboratory was negative using the CDC Zika IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Zika MAC-ELISA).The woman's male partner, also in his 20s, developed fever, a maculopapular rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis 7 days after sexual intercourse (day 6). On day 9, 3 days after the onset of his symptoms, the man sought care from the same primary care provider who had diagnosed Zika virus infection in his female partner. The provider suspected sexual transmission of Zika virus and contacted DOHMH to seek testing for the male partner. That same day, day 9, urine and serum specimens were collected from the man. Zika virus RNA was detected in urine but not serum by rRTPCR testing at the DOHMH Public Health Laboratory. Zika virus IgM antibodies were not detectable by the CDC Zika MAC-ELISA assay performed at the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center. The CDC Arbovirus Disease Branch confirmed all rRT-PCR results for urine and serum specimens from both partners.During an interview with DOHMH on day 17, the man confirmed that he had not traveled outside the United States during the year before his illness. He also confirmed a single encounter of condomless vaginal intercourse with his female partner (the patient) after her return to NYC and reported that he did not engage in oral or anal intercourse with her. The man reported that he noticed no blood on his uncircumcised penis immediately after intercourse that could have been associated either with vaginal bleeding or with any open lesions on his genitals. He also reported that he did not have any other recent sexual partners or receive a mosquito bite within the week preceding his illness. Independent follow-up interviews with the woman and man corroborated the exposure and illness history. The patients were consistent in describing illness onset, symptoms, sexual history, and the woman's travel. This information also was consistent with the initial report from the primary care provider.The timing and sequence of events support female-to-male Zika virus transmission through condomless vaginal intercourse. The woman likely was viremic at the time of sexual intercourse because her serum, collected 3 days later, had evidence of Zika virus RNA by rRT-PCR. Virus present in either vaginal fluids or menstrual blood might have been transmitted during exposure to her male partner's urethral mucosa or undetected abrasions on his penis. Recent reports document detection of Zika virus in the female genital tract, including vaginal fluid. A study on nonhuman primates found Zika virus RNA detected in the vaginal fluid of 3 nonpregnant females up to 7 days after subcutaneous inoculation, and Zika virus RNA was detected in specimens from a woman's cervical mucous, genital swab, and endocervical swab collected 3 days after illness onset, using an unspecified RT-PCR test. Further studies are needed to determine the characteristics of Zika virus shedding in the genital tract and vaginal fluid of humans.This case represents the 1st reported occurrence of female-to-male sexual transmission of Zika virus.Current guidance to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus is based on the assumption that transmission occurs from a male partner to a receptive partner. Ongoing surveillance is needed to determine the risk for transmission of Zika virus infection from a female to her sexual partners. Providers should report to their local or state health department any patients with illnesses compatible with Zika virus disease who do not have a history of travel to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission, but who had a sexual exposure to a partner who did travel.Persons who want to reduce the risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus should abstain from sex or correctly and consistently use condoms for vaginal, anal, and oral sex, as recommended in the current CDC guidance. Guidance on prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus, including other methods of barrier protection, will be updated as additional information becomes available (<http://www.cdc.gov/zika>).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>andRoland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>******[2] Non-vector transmissionDate: Thu 14 Jul 2016Source: Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease journal [edited] <http://www.travelmedicinejournal.com/article/S1477-8939(16)30080-1/abstract>Ref: Grischott F, Puhan M, Hatz C, Schlagenhauf P: Non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus: A systematic review. Travel Med Infect Dis. 2016. pii: S1477-8939(16)30080-1----------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------BackgroundIncreasing numbers of confirmed cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection resulting from non mosquito-borne transmission have been reported.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review (PRISMA guidelines) on intrauterine, intrapartum, sexual, and animal bite ZIKV transmission. The presence of the virus in breast milk, urine, saliva, and blood transfusions was also reviewed.ResultsThe search resulted in 285 papers of possible relevance, of which we included 53 in the systematic review. Mother-to-child transmission was most frequently described with adverse infant outcomes including microcephaly, intracranial calcification, and foetal death. Zika virus RNA has been detected in amniotic fluid, breast milk, seminal fluid, saliva, urine, and blood. Semen and blood products have proved to be infectious. Male-to-female and male-to-male ZIKV transmission is documented. There are contradictory results concerning the infectiousness of breast milk and urine and data on saliva, animal bites, transplantation, needlestick injury and laboratory work are inconclusive.ConclusionsOur systematic analysis shows that non vector-borne ZIKV transmission plays a role in the spread of ZIKV and has great societal impact. It has important public health implications for the prevention and control of ZIKV globally and will be a basis for policy and further research.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[3] Vector transmissionDate: Thu 21 Jul 2016Source: AgÌ»ncia Fiocruz de NotÌ cias [in Portuguese, trans. & summ.

The virus was found in 3 of 80 unfed [no blood] pools of this mosquito.In the laboratory, with the objective to investigate vector competence of _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquitoes were fed with a mixture of blood and virus to see if the virus would replicate. [The mosquitoes] were fed 10^4 or 10^6 concentration of Zika virus BRPE243/2015. A control group was fed blood without virus. Mosquitoes were collected [and tested for virus] on days 0, 3, 7, 11, and 15 post-feeding.After the 3rd post-feeding day, it was possible to detect presence of virus in salivary glands of the 2 mosquito species. After 7 days, the peak of salivary gland infection was confirmed by electron microscope. The virus load in the 2 species was similar.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[There have been 2 published studies that question mosquitoes of the genus _Culex_ as Zika virus vectors. In a 2015 study conducted during an outbreak of Zika virus infection in Chiapas state, southern Mexico, of 796 mosquitoes collected, _A. aegypti_ yielded ZIKV detection by RT-PCR in 15 of 55 pools (27 percent). No ZIKV was detected in 322 individual _C. quinquefasciatus_.Reference---------Guerbois M, Fernandez-Salas I, Azar SR, et al: Outbreak of Zika virus infection, Chiapas State, Mexico, 2015, and 1st confirmed transmission by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in the Americas. J Infect Dis. (2016); <http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/18/infdis.jiw302.full.pdf+html>A 2nd study was done to determine the likelihood of mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus in states without populations of _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes. To understand the potential risk for spread of Zika virus in temperate US states, the relative abilities of 2 mosquito species, _Culex pipiens_ and _Ae. triseriatus_ mosquitoes to transmit Zika virus were compared in the laboratory. The known vector species, _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_, mosquitoes served as positive controls.Mosquitoes were exposed to Asian lineage Zika virus strain PRVABC59 (GenBank accession no. KU501215) by feeding on Zika virus-infected IFNAR(-/-) mice. Mice (n = 4/replicate) yielded infectious blood meal concentrations of 10^6.02 PFU/mL å± 0.67 (mean å± SD; biological replicate no. 1), 10^4.74 PFU/mL å± 0.06 (replicate no. 2), and 10^6.83 PFU/mL å± 0.45 (replicate no. 3). All samples from _Cx. Pipiens_ mosquitoes and all replicates were negative for Zika virus by plaque assay. In contrast, _Ae. triseriatus_ mosquitoes were susceptible to infection when exposed to mice with the highest viremia concentrations. However, none of these infected mosquitoes disseminated virus and none were capable of transmitting the virus. Data from _Ae. albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes that had been exposed to the same mice demonstrated that the viremia concentrations used could productively infect these mosquitoes.Reference---------Aliota MT, Peinado SA, Osorio JE, Bartholomay LC: _Culex pipiens_ and _Aedes triseriatus_ mosquito susceptibility to Zika virus [letter].

Published online before print 15 Jul 2016----------------------------------------------------------------------In the wake of the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, international resources have been dedicated to combating the increasing rates of ZIKV-associated microcephaly. However, other severe neurologic complications, such as Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS), have received less attention and funding. In July 2015, 76 patients with recent symptoms suggestive of ZIKV infection with neurologic syndromes were identified in the state of Bahia, northeast Brazil, of which 42 (55 percent) were confirmed GBS In November 2015, the Aggeu MagalhÌ£es Research Center of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation reported that ZIKV infection was found in 10 out of 224 suspected dengue case positive samples belonged to patients with a neurologic syndrome.In November 2015, we created a self-funded study group in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, involving neurologists, radiologists, and critical care and emergency medicine specialists to gather more precise epidemiologic information regarding ZIKV-associated neurologic illnesses in adults (including GBS, meningoencephalitis, and transverse myelitis) and to help coordinate care of these patients (the RIO GBS-ZIKV Research Network).Between 5 Dec 2015, and 18 Mar 2016, we identified 20 confirmed GBS cases referred to our university through our network, located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This volume of patients with GBS exceeds the 16 cases reported at our center over 24 months in 2013 and 2014 (prior to the ZIKV outbreak). This represents an increase from an average of 0.67 GBS cases per month to 5.4 cases per month. Of these 20 GBS cases, 17 were associated with a viral prodrome consistent with ZIKV (pruritic rash, fever, or arthralgias). Of note, only 20 percent of patients with ZIKV infection are thought to develop florid symptoms. The association of GBS and ZIKV has also been observed in French Polynesia, where the predominant form of GBS reorted was acute axonal neuropathy (AMAN). In our genetically distinct population we have observed ZIKV-related AMAN, acute motor sensory polyneuropathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and Miller Fisher variant. In addition, cases of encephalitis, transverse myelitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following a ZIKV prodrome have presented to our facility.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[5] Placental infectionDate: Mon 18 Jul 2016Source: STAT [edited]<https://www.statnews.com/2016/07/18/zika-fetus-infection-dengue-antibiotic/>New research shows that the Zika virus has 2 routes by which it can infect a developing fetus, depending on when during a pregnancy the infection occurs. It also shows an existing drug might be able to limit the damage wreaked by the virus.The new study, by scientists at the University of California at San Francisco [UCSF] and the University of California [UC] at Berkeley, suggests that an antibiotic called duramycin seems to be able to block Zika's ability to latch onto the cells it wants to affect.""It was day and night. There was either infection or no infection, depending on how much drug you used,"" Lenore Pereira, one of 2 contributing authors of the study, said in an interview.The article was published in the journal Cell Host and Microbe.Pereira is a professor of microbiology in UCSF's department of cell and tissue biology. She is an expert on cytomegalovirus, another virus that can trigger microcephaly -- a condition in which a newborn has an abnormally small head -- when it infects a developing fetus. She partnered with Eva Harris, a virus expert at UC Berkeley, on the study.The researchers wanted to look at whether Zika virus would grow in cells from human placentas. The goal was to figure out how the virus makes its way to the developing fetus when a woman becomes infected in pregnancy.They found that in the 1st trimester, the developing cells of the placenta were highly vulnerable to the virus. Pereira said the surface of the placenta does not become infected. But the virus somehow passes through the surface to the cells inside.""We don't know why,"" she told STAT. ""I really cannot tell you why the virus gets across.""She and Harris -- who is an expert on dengue virus, a close relative to Zika -- suspect that previous exposure to dengue virus may predispose some women to be more at risk of having an affected pregnancy if they become infected with Zika. But Pereira stressed that's still a theory. And it's known that women who haven't previously been infected with dengue can also give birth to an affected child if they contract Zika during pregnancy.Researchers have seen a wide range of birth defects associated with the Zika virus, including problems in the babies' cardiac, digestive, and genitourinary systems.The new research suggests that once infected, the placenta is, in effect, feeding virus into the fetus's blood system, which allows Zika to make its way to the developing fetal brain.Later in pregnancy -- during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters -- the virus is able to infect the outer cells of the amniotic sac, which encases the developing fetus. They pass into the amniotic fluid, a development that leaves the fetus ""floating in virus,"" Pereira said. In this latter circumstance, the virus likely enters the fetus through the skin and gets taken up into the fetal blood stream.Infected cells produced higher levels of virus when infection occurred in midgestation than later in the pregnancy, Pereira said. She suggested the damage the virus does to a developing fetus would likely vary, depending on how long it is exposed to the virus.Interestingly, the researchers did these experiments using 2 strains of Zika virus -- the African strain, 1st found in Uganda in 1947, and a strain from the current Latin American outbreak, from Nicaragua.Both viruses can infect the cells and tissues of the placenta and amniotic sac. But the researchers saw a difference between the 2 -- a possible hint as to why Zika's association with birth defects has only come to light recently.""We also found that the epidemic strain [viruses] were more productive,"" said Pereira. ""In other words, they could make more virus than the old prototype strain from Africa. We don't know why, but we did find that.""The types of cells that were infected all carry a protein called TIM1. Pereira said when she came to suspect this protein was important for Zika infection, she did a search of the scientific literature for it, discovering an article from late last year [2015] that said the antibiotic duramycin prevents dengue and West Nile viruses from attaching to cells.Given that both are related to Zika, she and her colleagues ran some experiments to see if the drug was also active against Zika. It was -- dramatically reducing the virus's ability to infect cells and proliferate. The drug would need to be tested in animal models to see whether what works in the test tube is also effective -- and safe to use -- in a living organism, Pereira noted.Those studies will take some time, but perhaps less time than it will take to develop and license a Zika vaccine, she suggested.[Byline: Helen Branswell]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The final comment in the report is on target and a key future study will need to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug in vivo, likely first in mice, then non-human primates, and finally in humans.
