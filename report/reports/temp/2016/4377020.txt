Capitol Fax, Associated Press and Herald-Whig reports [edited]<http://capitolfax.com/2016/07/27/latest-legionnaires-outbreak-puzzles-health-experts/>Gov. Bruce Rauner is scheduled to visit the Illinois Veterans' Home in Quincy a day after [Wed 27 Jul 2016] state officials reported [on Tue 26 Jul 2016] 2 residents have new cases of legionnaires' disease.Last year [2015], legionnaires' disease sickened 53 people and led to 12 deaths at the home. The cases the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs disclosed Tuesday [26 Jul 2016] come less than a month after a nearly USD 5 million [state-of-the-art] water treatment plant and delivery system was unveiled at the facility. The bacteria that cause the disease can be inhaled in water vapor.Dave MacDonna, a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, said there have been no deaths. He would not disclose the condition of the 2 residents who had contracted the disease, citing health privacy laws.MacDonna said water at the home will continue to be treated the same it has since the new treatment plant came online. It will continue to test for and flush any harmful bacteria from the system, something that MacDonna said happens twice per day. Hot water temperatures will be at 150 degrees.From what I was told by the administration last night [26 Jul 2016], national and state experts are dumbfounded about this recurring outbreak. There was clear evidence of the bacteria in last year's testing. Not so this year.[Byline: Rich Miller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Quincy, with a population of 40 633 in 2010, is a city on the Mississippi River and is the county seat of Adams County, Illinois, United States (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Illinois>). Many veterans' homes are managed and funded by state governments (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_soldiers%27_home>). The Illinois Veterans' Home, a 129-year-old facility in Quincy, Illinois, is responsible for providing economical and quality long-term care for veterans and their spouses, which includes domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled healthcare (<http://www.quincyivh.org>). According to its website, the Illinois Veterans' Home at Quincy is one of the larger and older veterans' homes in the country, with nearly 450 residents and over 25 buildings that house a post office, bank, assembly hall, guest house, mini post exchange, chapel, animal park, museum, and television station; water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone, and data networks are owned and maintained by the home (<http://www.quincyivh.org>).When last reported by ProMED-mail in September 2015, there were 54 cases of legionnaires' disease, including 12 deaths, at the Quincy veterans' home (Legionellosis - USA (15): (IL) fatal, veterans home, update, RFI 20150924.3668124). We were never told any further information concerning the epidemiology of this outbreak. For example, we were never told if the cases of legionnaires' disease were linked epidemiologically in any way other than residence at the home, e.g., did the cases reside or attend activities in a particular building?We also were never told if genotyping of isolates from the previous or current outbreak have been done. Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates could aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates. However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.People with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and smokers are particularly at risk for severe disease. Although _Legionella_ infection is usually thought to be acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols, sometimes, for example in debilitated elderly people, aspiration of contaminated water is thought to be the mode of transmission (1-3). Aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated water is also the obvious source for neonatal legionnaires' disease that has occurred following use of _Legionella_-contaminated home birthing pools (4-6).The aging water system at the Illinois Veterans' Home was recently updated. A news report on 3 Jul 2016 said that the updated water treatment plant and delivery system was unveiled on 29 Jun 2016 after it went online the previous week (<http://herald-review.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/illinois-veteans-home-s-new-water-system-fights-legionnaire-s/article_3f69fd1e-f6bd-5643-94a9-e95a4932a327.html>): ""Water from the Quincy water system enters the [new] treatment plant, where it's tested and treated with additional disinfectant chemicals each day. It then travels to individual buildings and is heated to 165 degrees to kill bacteria. Mixing valves cool the water before it's released within the building's water system."" The veterans' home has been reported to have stopped admitting new residents and water restrictions may be put in place until the source of the new cases can be identified (<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/07/28/rauner-illinois-doing-all-it-can-on-legionnaires-cases.html>).References:1.

ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK: (England) neonatal, underwater birthing 20140708.2594991. Over 4 weeks have elapsed since the new water treatment facility at the Quincy veterans' home went online. The incubation period for legionnaires' disease is 2-14 days (<https://legionnaires.ecdc.europa.eu/?pid=107>). Although we are not told exactly when symptoms began in the 2 most recent cases, presumably their exposure was to the new, rather than the old, water treatment facility. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/216>.]
