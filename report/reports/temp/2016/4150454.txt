Experts continue to work to determine whether a cluster of deaths there is linked to 2 other cases in Liberia.Ebrahima Sylla, spokesperson for Guinea's EVD response unit, said: ""We have 8 deaths out of 9 confirmed cases. The last fatality dates back to Sunday [3 Apr 2016]."" Sylla said the victim -- a woman -- died at an Ebola treatment centre in the city of Nzerekore, where a few other patients have been cared for in recent weeks following a succession of cases among a family near the border with Liberia. ""There is just one confirmed case still receiving treatment at the center,"" he added.[A vaccination campaign was well underway in the area of Guinea where the new cases were registered, while monitoring of those in contact with the dead woman in Liberia was also a priority.""In Guinea, already 1200 people have been vaccinated. Right now, the work is ongoing in Liberia to monitor 90 so-far-identified contacts, and there is also a plan to vaccinate them,"" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic in Geneva said.The WHO has said that Ebola no longer constitutes an international emergency, but the announcement of new cases in West Africa has demonstrated the difficulty of managing the aftermath of the virus.The Ebola epidemic was declared over in Guinea and Liberia months ago, though a significant number of deaths are believed to have gone unreported, and ""flare-ups"" relating to the persistence of the virus in survivors' bodies pose ongoing challenges.The WHO will hold a meeting this week with Liberian and Guinean authorities to work on cross-border surveillance, Jasarevic said [excerpted from <http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/06/world/science-health-world/guinea-vaccinations-ramped-ebola-claims-another-victim/#.VwpiaqSLTIW>. - Mod.LK]7 Apr 2016: Liberia and Guinea step up coordination to stem new cases of Ebola<http://apps.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/liberia-guinea-flareups-update/en/index.html>1) Liberia: The World Health Organization (WHO)] and Ministry of Health teams in Guinea and Liberia have established epidemiological links between new [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] cases in Liberia and a current flare-up of Ebola in neighboring Guinea following intensified case investigations and contact tracing.Investigation teams in Guinea had been searching for the wife and 3 young children of a man who died of EVD last month [March 2016] in the southern prefecture of Macenta. The family members were considered high-risk contacts. It is now believed the wife traveled to Liberia with her children after her husband's death to join relatives who live in the capital, Monrovia. It is there she reportedly developed symptoms. She initially sought care in local clinics and died on the way to a hospital in Monrovia on 31 Mar 2015. Two of her sons, a 5 year old and a 2 year old, have since tested positive for EVD and are being treated at an Ebola care facility in Monrovia.2) Guinea: In Guinea, preparations are underway for EVD vaccination for contacts to prevent potential spread of the disease. A large-scale government-led response continues in Guinea's prefectures of Nzerekore and Macenta, where there have been 9 EVD cases since the flare-up began in late-February [2016]. Eight people have died, and one 11-year-old child remains in treatment in an Ebola care center.To date, over 1400 people who may have been in contact with the confirmed cases and contacts of theirs have been vaccinated with the Ebola vaccine.3) Tests from blood samples of the confirmed cases indicate the source of the virus is from a single and known transmission chain. This suggests exposure to infected body fluids from a survivor rather than a re-introduction of Ebola virus from the wild animal population.]7 Apr 2016 Liberia: Families under voluntary Ebola observation complain of neglect<http://www.bushchicken.com/families-under-voluntary-ebola-observation-complain-of-neglect/>[1) The latest information indicates there are now 3 confirmed cases [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] reported.Sorbor George, Director for Communication at the Ministry of Health, told media the latest cases involve the sons of the 30-year-old dead woman, aged 5 and 3. One suspected case is at Redemption Hospital.The initial contacts have increased from 85 to 97. The house in which the sister of the latest EVD case resided is home to 4 families, a total of 12 people. This contradicts the account of health authorities, who earlier said the woman, upon arrival in Monrovia from Guinea, lodged with her sister in the Soul Clinic community and later sought medical treatment at the Ma Watta Clinic in Jacob Town. Contact tracing is ongoing in the Soul Clinic community.2) According to members of several families whose relatives are currently under voluntary observation for the new EVD outbreak in Kemah Town, in the Soul Clinic community, their under-observation family members have been neglected. Members of the families said that since last Fri [1 Apr 2016], the government has not properly attended to their wellbeing after placing them under voluntary observation. Complaints include the quarantined being without water and enough food.In addition, a visit to the community showed that the area is not effectively restricted. Visitors and residents were seen moving around in the observation area. Additionally, it was not clear which individuals were under the voluntary precautionary observation. There was also noted a lack of effective control of persons coming in contact with voluntarily quarantined individuals, which could undermine the entire observation process.]7 Apr 2016 Nassau Bahamas: DC rules out Ebola as cause of death of Bahamian patient<http://www.caribbean360.com/news/cdc-rules-ebola-cause-death-bahamian-patient#ixzz45AJEahQB>[A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has ruled out Ebola as the cause of death of a Bahamian woman last month (March 2016).]Support-----8 Apr 2016 Japan: Japanese medical team to assist Liberia in Ebola fight<http://gnnliberia.com/2016/04/08/japanese-medical-team-to-assist-liberia-in-ebola-fight/>[The Japanese Association of Medical Logistics for Disaster has pledged to assist Liberia to overcome its [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] emergency situation.Dr. Yamamoto spoke Wed [6 Apr 2016] at the head of a high-level delegation of the Japanese Association of Medical Logistics for Disaster, which paid a courtesy call on Foreign Minister Marjon Kamara at her office in Monrovia.

According to the Obama administration, it is forced to shift funds from [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] to ZIKV because Congress has not approved a USD 1.9 billion request to respond to the mosquito-borne ZIKV.According to health officials who testified on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] the move is short-sighted. ""If it's about shifting from one priority to another, then it's worrying, because one of the lessons we learned from Ebola [is] that we need to be prepared,"" said Sophie Delaunay of the French group Doctors Without Borders. ""It's going to come back.""""While new cases of EVD have been dramatically reduced, Ebola is not over. And the conditions that made it an epidemic persist,"" said Democratic Senator Ed Markey at a hearing of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa.][Transfer of funds from Ebola to Zika is not in the best interests of global health, which should be a priority. There is no question funds are needed to control Zika virus. But funds also need to go towards rebuilding the public health infrastructure in West Africa, which will be a necessity in the event of another outbreak in the region, whether it be Ebola, Lassa, Marburg, yellow fever, or any of a multitude of infectious diseases. We should particularly be paying attention to yellow fever, which is continuing to cause new cases and deaths in Angola; see ProMED-mail post ""Yellow fever - Africa (35): Angola 20160409.4149455,"" which reported that 1600 suspected and confirmed (516) cases have been reported nationally, including 230 deaths.
