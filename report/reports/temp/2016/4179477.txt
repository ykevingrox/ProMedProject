WHO Emergencies Preparedness Response, Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/22-april-2016-yellow-fever-china/en/>Between 4-12 Apr 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of China notified the World Health Oorganization [WHO] of 2 additional imported cases of yellow fever (YF). To date, a total of 11 laboratory-confirmed YF cases imported from Angola have been reported in China.The 10th imported case is an 18 year old male from Fujian Province, China, who had been living in Angola. On 12 Mar [2016], he had onset of fever and other symptoms, and visited a local hospital in Angola. On 27 Mar 2016, the patient travelled to Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, China via Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Beijing, China. He was afebrile on arrival in China. On 28 Mar [2016], the patient sought medical care. Yellow fever infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Fujian International Travel Health Centre. Test results were corroborated by the Fujian Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The patient was hospitalised in Fuzhou and remains under treatment.The 11th imported case is a 29 year old male from Jiangsu Province, China, who had been working in Angola. On 5 Apr [2016], he [developed] fever and other symptoms, and sought medical care at a local hospital in Angola. On 9 Apr [2016], the patient was reported to have tested positive for YF in Angola by PCR. He flew back to China via Dubai, arriving in Beijing on 10 Apr [2016]. On arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to a hospital. His sample was tested at Beijing CDC and found to be positive for YF by PCR. On 12 Apr [2016], expert consultation organised by the Beijing Health and Family Planning Commission confirmed the patient as an imported YF case based on the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. The case is currently stable.Public health response----------------------The Chinese government has taken the following measures:- intensifying multi-sectoral coordination and collaboration,- strengthening surveillance, vector monitoring and risk assessment,- enhancing clinical management of yellow fever cases,- conducting vector control activities,- carrying out public risk communication activities,- deploying a medical team to Angola to provide yellow fever vaccination to unvaccinated Chinese nationals.WHO risk assessment-------------------The report of yellow fever infection in non-immunized travellers returning from a country where vaccination against the disease is mandatory underlines the need to reinforce the implementation of vaccination requirements, in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). Furthermore, this report highlights the risk of international spread of yellow fever through non-immunized travellers. However, the risk of establishment of a local cycle of transmission in China is low due to the current climatic condition, which is unfavourable for the competent vector, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.WHO advice----------WHO urges member states, especially those where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (that is, where the competent vector is present), to strengthen the control of immunisation status of travellers to all potentially endemic areas.WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to China based on the current information available.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The 11th case was previously reported in a post on 12 Apr 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160413.4156986). This is our first post regarding  the 18 year old 10th case from Fujian province. Although it is too early in the season for vector mosquitoes to become abundant and active, dengue outbreaks have occurred in Fujian province in the recent past. A 29 Sep 2014 dengue (conf.) ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20141013.2856793) reported 60 cases in the province. Vector mosquitoes can be expected to be become active there as the weather becomes warmer. One hopes that there will be no more YF patients returning to the province when transmission season begins.It is not clear how many Chinese workers there are in Angola, and how many of them have been vaccinated. The fact that YF virus infected Chinese workers and business people are returning to China when ill indicates that not everyone has been vaccinated. A proof of vaccination should be a requirement for all individuals entering into YF endemic countries such as Angola.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Dan Silver, edited]<http://tinyurl.com/zla2l6f>The Health Bureau is investigating 1 suspected case of YF. The suspected patient is 26 years old, an Angolan female tourist. On Sunday [16 Apr 2016], she left Angola and on Tuesday [19 Apr 2016] passed through Hong Kong by ship to Macau. There were no signs of illness when she entered Macau and is undergoing a 7 day health observation period. Because this woman's family members said today that she had had fever, local authorities arranged for her to have tests at Hospital Conde S JanuÌÁrio. If she has YF, an announcement will be made immediately. The Health Bureau says the suspected patient now has no symptoms or discomfort; her condition is stable. She stayed with her family members after arriving in Macau and didn't go out, and she denied that YF outbreak is occurring in the part of Angola where she lives. Family members staying with her also do not show any signs of YF.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Dan Silver[Apparently, this Angolan woman had not been vaccinated against YF in Angola, or that possible diagnosis of her fever would not have been considered. ProMED-mail awaits with considerable interest the release of the laboratory tests, confirming or ruling out YF. Simply being febrile is not sufficient to conclude that the patient has YF. One hopes that the Macau health officials are as careful to monitor this patient and the area in China where she has been, as they have done for the previous YF cases imported into China from Angola. Macau has had very occasional cases of locally transmitted dengue virus (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20041119.3100), indicating that the YF virus vector mosquitoes are present, but at this time of year not likely to be abundant or active. - Mod.TY]
