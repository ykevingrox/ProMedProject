Though another 4-year-old girl also died at the hospital [Mon 17 Oct 2016], hospital sources claimed that to be a case of pneumonia.Unofficial sources have pegged the toll above 60.According to official sources, of the 184 children admitted to the hospital, 119 have been discharged so far. At present 9 children are undergoing treatment at the DHH [District Headquarter Hospital] -- one in the ICU and the rest in the JE ward, collector K Sudarshan Chakraborty told media persons.The collector further said of the 56 children who died at the hospital, only 20 tested positive for JE.

Besides, DDT and DTI have been sprayed in 103 and 136 villages respectively.Providing more details on the casualties, the collector revealed that a total of 54 children tested positive of which 34 were discharged after treatment.Meanwhile, Dr Nruparaj Sahoo, deputy secretary of panchayati raj [decentralized form of government] who has been appointed as officer on special duty (OSD), visited the DHH [Mon 17 Oct 2016] and spoke to officials. Future course of action would be decided following a meeting with the collector, Sahoo said.Health director Dr Kailash Chandra Das said the number of JE-affected cases has been on the decline after massive awareness drives were launched by the health workers following the visit of the minister and secretary of the department. He hailed the efforts put in by the doctors of other districts to control the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of deaths attributable to Japanese encephalitis (JE) has increased from 48 on 13 Oct 2016 to 59 on Tue 18 Oct 2016. The bed nets should be helpful in preventing mosquito bites. Single-time village fogging is unlikely to provide long-term vector mosquito population reduction, especially if there are extensive wetlands or rice fields around the village where the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes breed. As with previous reports from this area, no mention is made about JE vaccination, which would be an effective way to prevent JE cases.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]
