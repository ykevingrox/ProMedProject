The ministry has said that infections with that strain of influenza remain within safe limits.It also said that the 1037 cases of suspected bird flu (H5N1) since November 2015 all proved negative.[byline: Al-Masry Al-Youm]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[H1N1 is sometimes referred to swine flu.
