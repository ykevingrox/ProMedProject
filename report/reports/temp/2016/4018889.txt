The parents are of Moroccan origin and unknown vaccination status. The son is 7 years old, born in Spain, and has had 5 doses of the pertussis vaccine. These 3 have not required hospitalization, the Ministry reported in a press release; however, a 3-week-old infant remains hospitalized and was transferred to the Infant Jesus Hospital in Madrid. Once there, he was taken to the ""12 of October"" Hospital, where he remains in the Intensive Care Unit.The Ministry of Health stated that the known cases of pertussis in Castilla-La Mancha ""are not different from those registered in other years."" While in Spain, there is an incidence of 15.6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants; ""the incidence in Castilla-La Mancha is 6.8 per 100 000 inhabitants,"" announced the regional government. They further explained that cases of pertussis in infants under 3 months old can be most serious, because the vaccine is given during the 2nd month of life and takes about 15 days to create defenses.The strategy adopted in Castilla-La Mancha is to vaccinate pregnant women against pertussis in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, concentrating on weeks 28 to 36, preferably between weeks 28 and 32. This action has been carried out since 9 Nov 2015 by primary care professionals after being agreed upon by experts in the field. In the case of a pertussis diagnosis, a pediatrician or family doctor recommends treatment with antimicrobials.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different, with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000, and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.A 2014 publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes. JAMA. 2014; 312(18): 1897-904 (<http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1930817>).Castilla-La Mancha is a southwestern European region that was part of the Kingdom of Castile.
