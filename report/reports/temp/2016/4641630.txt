The Clinton County Health Department is collecting more samples to try to identify the source of the _Legionella_ bacteria that caused the man to become sick with pneumonia.All 5 people who developed Legionnaire's disease live at an apartment complex in the city's West End, and everyone at that site has been notified.New water samples have been taken from locations in and around the area where the cases were found. Earlier samples did not test positive for the bacteria.The 4 people who had Legionnaire's disease in October [2016] were all treated at University of Vermont Health Network, Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital [CVPH] in Plattsburgh, recovered, and were discharged.The _Legionella_ bacteria live in water and moist soil and rarely causes illness. ""It becomes a health problem when small droplets of water that contain the bacteria get into the air and people breathe them in,"" the Health Department explained in a news release.While the number of cases in Plattsburgh is small, all pneumonia can be serious, the release said. Residents who experience symptoms of pneumonia -- cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, headache and fever -- are being urged to seek medical guidance.Nicole Louis, supervising public health nurse dealing with communicable diseases for the Clinton County Health Department, said the man who now has pneumonia is in stable condition at CVPH.Jennifer Trudeau, a registered nurse with the Health Department, said it's not necessarily unusual to have another case about a month after the 1st infections. ""The milder temperatures may have a role in that,"" she said, noting that the bacterial infection is seen most frequently in September, though it is possible for it to arise all year long. The illness can't be passed from person to person and is not caused by drinking water. [In addition to acquiring legionnaires' disease by inhaling aerosolized _Legionella_, the disease can be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water, and possible person-to-person transmission has been described (Correia AM, GonÌ¤alves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356>).]Some conditions produce a greater risk of infection, including: Being over 50 years of age; Being a current or former smoker; Having chronic lung disease, such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Having a weakened immune system from diseases like cancer, diabetes or kidney failure; and Taking medication that weakens the immune system.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, common sources of infection include water used for showering (potable water), cooling towers (parts of large air conditioning systems), decorative fountains, and hot tubs.The New York State Department of Health is working with the local department to track down possible sources for the Plattsburgh cases.Samples have been taken from faucets and showers in and around the apartment complex, Louis said. ""We are looking at every possible aspect"" for a source, she said. The samples have been sent to the New York State Wadsworth Lab for testing. ""Overall, the residents are feeling there needs to be a solution, that we need to find the source,"" Louis said. ""And they seem to be happy that we are continuing to work on that. Hopefully, we can find a solution and get it corrected.""[Byline: Lois Clermont]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion1@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 5 cases of legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. A history of travel within the incubation period of legionnaires' disease will help identify travel-associated cases.Plattsburgh, with a population of almost 20 000 residents, is a city located on the western shore of Lake Champlain in the northeastern part of the state of New York in Clinton County, in the United States (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattsburgh_(city),_New_York>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.]
