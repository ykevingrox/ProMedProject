RPP [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://rpp.pe/peru/junin/junin-sector-salud-alerta-epidemia-de-fiebre-amarilla-en-la-selva-central-noticia-954174>The JunÌ n Regional Health Office stated that in the 2 latest months 3 yellow fever (YF) deaths were reported after 8 years without cases.The head of the JunÌ n Regional Health Office, Luis ZÌ¼Ì±iga, issued an alert given the reoccurrence of yellow fever in the central forest which to date has left 3 dead and one seriously ill. The physician indicated that for the past 8 years no yellow fever deaths were reported; in less than 2 months 3 deaths have been reported of people who travel in the forest and are infected by the virus. He added that a large number of people, who must be vaccinated 10 days before in order for their body to respond, travel to Satipo and Chanchamayo provinces [JunÌ n region] without getting the vaccine against yellow fever.Because of these reported cases, the Regional Health Office ordered the installation of a vaccination center in the Pedregal area, the place of entry into Chanchamayo province, where the people can be vaccinated; however the effectiveness [of the vaccine] against the disease may be less [than adequate] before 10 days has passed. --Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[The Amazon Basin, including the part pertaining to Peru, is endemic for yellow fever virus, where it is maintained in the sylvan (forest or jungle) cycle. Last year (2015) as of 28 Nov 2015, Peru reported 21 cases of sylvan yellow fever in 7 regions, with 5 cases in Junin. These 4 current cases were infected in the forest.  Curiously, no mention is made of the deaths of YF virus infected monkeys in the forest, which is often the indicator of circulation of the virus in the area. Sylvan human  cases bring the risk subsequent spill over into urban and suburban human populations when infected individuals bring the virus into areas where the urban cycle vector, _Aedes aegypt_ occurs and these populations are not vaccinated.  Setting up vaccination centers is a good plan, even though vaccinees do not meet the recommended 10 day wait before entering into areas of YF virus transmission risk.
