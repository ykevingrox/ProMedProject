Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/trichinosis-outbreak-in-siberia-linked-to-eating-bear-meat-92662/>The number of people infected with the parasitic disease, trichinosis, has grown to 20 in the Irkutsk region of Siberia, Russia, according to a Sib.fm report (computer translated).The public health investigation reveals that the hunters contracted the infection in May after preparing smoked bear meat which was later consumed. Shortly after consuming the not fully cooked meat, they complained of feeling sick and went to the hospital.Trichinellosis or trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused by the roundworm _Trichinella spiralis_. If someone ingests undercooked or raw meat with the encysted larvae, the stomach acid releases the larvae which mature to adults in the intestine. After about a week the female starts releasing larvae which enter the bloodstream and find their way to skeletal muscle where they encapsulate. There can be gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking acute food poisoning when there is activity of the adults in the intestine.Sudden appearance of fever, muscle soreness and pain with swelling of parts of the face is early classic signs. This can sometimes be followed by retinal hemorrhages and other ocular signs. With heavy infections cardiac, respiratory and neurological problems may ensue with death by heart failure being most common. The more larvae you ingest, the more serious the disease.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Carnivores worldwide may be infected with _Trichinella spp_. _Trichinella_ is common in carnivores in Russia and raw, undercooked or insufficiently smoked meat is a classical source of infection. Home slaughtered pigs and sausages tainted with wild boar meat (illegal) have been behind recent outbreaks. The symptoms are as described and the diagnosis is confirmed by eosinophilia and specific antibodies. In overwhelming infections the outcome can be lethal. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/469>.]
