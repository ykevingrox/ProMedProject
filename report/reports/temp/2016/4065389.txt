According to Daru General Hospital Chief Executive Officer, Sister Orpah Tugo, 478 cases have been detected. ""The extra-pulmonary TB cases are [almost 3 times] the [number of] new pulmonary TB cases of 174. Total cases are 652, detected from October 2015 to January 2016,"" she said. The number of patients accessing treatment has increased to 227 and, according to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer, this is because of the preventative health awareness being carried out in the area. ""[The] number of patients diagnosed has increased to January 2016 and we have run out of bed space. Most patients are out in the community under the treatment support program,"" Sister Tugo said.Those diagnosed with multidrug resistance TB now stands at 161. Sister Tugo says it's expected that by 2018, there should be a decline on the TB epidemic in Daru, Western province.[Byline: Fabian Hakalits]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Papua New Guinea (PNG), with a population of over 7 million people, gained its independence from Australia in 1975 and is now a Commonwealth with Queen Elizabeth II as its Sovereign and Head of State (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea>). It occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia.Daru, located on an island located near the mouth of the Fly River with a population of 13 000, is the capital of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daru>). Daru is just north of Torres Strait and Far North Queensland, the northernmost part of the state of Queensland, Australia.The Torres Strait Islands Treaty signed by Australia and PNG allows for free movement of people (without passports or visas) between the Torres Strait Islands and PNG for traditional activities. The Torres Strait Islanders, who are culturally akin to the coastal peoples of PNG, became citizens of Queensland, Australia in 1967 with full access to health and social services and freedom to travel and work in Australia (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders>). Many thousands of Torres Strait Islanders are said to live in Queensland today and patients from PNG with MDR TB have migrated across the border into Far North Queensland (Tuberculosis - Australia: (QL) ex Papua New Guinea, XDR, fatal 20130318.1591289).In a prior ProMED-mail post (Tuberculosis, MDR - Papua New Guinea 20151120.3806545) we reported that, of 60 patients living in the Western Province of PNG who sought treatment between 2000 and 2006 in the Torres Strait Islands because of limited access to health care in the Western Province of PNG, 15 (25 percent) were found to have multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (<https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2008/188/3/evidence-primary-transmission-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-western-province>).The prior ProMED-mail post also reported that 39 percent of MDR TB in the Western Province was said to be primary, that is, the result of person-to-person transmission, rather than a consequence of treatment with an inappropriate drug regimen that is not effective at eliminating the particular strain of TB causing the infection and that Daru was the epicenter of primary MDR TB. Primary drug resistance indicates a need for better TB control to interrupt transmission, whereas acquired drug resistance indicates a need for better patient management to prevent the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14673>.]
