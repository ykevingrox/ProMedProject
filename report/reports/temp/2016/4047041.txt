Angola Press Agency (Angop) [edited]<http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/saude/2016/1/8/Health-authorities-warn-fake-yellow-fever-vaccines,4dd5d4f4-6f09-4077-a4a3-c9bfeb0c668f.html>The General Inspection Department of the Health Ministry is warning the public of the existence of fake yellow fever vaccines on the international market.The information is contained in a press note from the health authorities that reached Angop [Angola Press Agency] on [Tue 23 Feb 2016].The health authorities inform and ban the import, trade, distribution, and use of batch 2265 of the ""Amaril"" vaccine throughout the country for a period of 3 days.According to the source, warning 2/2016 of the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that [forged batch 2265 of the ""Amaril"" vaccine has been circulating in] the international market, with the characteristics ""vaccinia 'Amaril' contra a febre amarela, lote no. 2265, data de fabricacao 7/2012, validade 07/2017, laboratorio Institut Pasteur de Dakar.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The WHO alert can be accessed at <http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/drugalerts/Alert2_2016_Fev_Falsified_AMARILyellow-fever-vaccine_searo_en.pdf.>. It says, ""This Medical Product Alert relates to the confirmed circulation of falsified versions of ""AMARIL stabilised vaccine"" in South East Asia.""The alert does not mention Angola, and it is not clear if this batch of fake vaccine has been found in Angola, or if this report is just an alert to the risk. If the lot of fake vaccine has actually been used in Angola in the face of the ongoing yellow fever (YF) outbreak, that is alarming. If the fake vaccine is limited to South East Asia, that is still a concern. If individuals vaccinated with it travel to YF endemic areas, they will not be protected, and if they become infected there and are viremic, run the risk of carrying the virus back to South East Asia where vector mosquitoes are abundant. If the fake vaccine is found anywhere, it should be destroyed promptly.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>. - Mod.TY]
