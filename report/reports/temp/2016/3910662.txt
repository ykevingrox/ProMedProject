The Herald [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201601040345.html>The government has provided USD 30 000 for the vaccination of livestock against anthrax in Filabusi, Matabeleland. The money was used to buy 150 000 doses, which are being used to vaccinate cattle, sheep and goats in the area.Department of Veterinary Services director Dr Josphat Nyika, on Wednesday [30 Dec 2015] said the fund would go a long way in ensuring vaccination of the livestock. ""About 10 000 vaccine doses have already been deployed, and vaccination is underway in Filabusi. Farmers are co-operating very well. We are still mounting roadblocks and veterinary checks to prevent the movement of livestock into and from the affected areas,"" he said.Dr Nyika said farmers in the area have been urged to destock as a drought measure, and the DVS is monitoring all abattoirs in the area with assistance from the Ministry of Health and Child Care to ensure vaccinated animals are not slaughtered.He said vaccinated livestock should not be slaughtered within 2 weeks.""We urge farmers to avoid opening carcasses of cattle that die of natural causes to reduce the contamination of pastures with anthrax,"" he said.[Byline: Elita Chikwati]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This should achieve that which needs to be done.For a map of Zimbabwe, go to <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_rel_2002.jpg>.
