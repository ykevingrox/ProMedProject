The school has been informed and is working with the Waikato District Health Board's Population Health to control the spread of the disease.It is unknown whether the infectious person was a student or employed by the school.During their infectious periods, the 3 infected people also attended Waikato Hospital's emergency department respectively on Fri 25 Mar; Mon 4 Apr; and Sat 9 Apr [2016].Medical Officer of Health Felicity Dumble said anyone who attended the hospital's emergency department on those dates might have been exposed to measles.People who shared the same air as someone infected with measles, even just being in the same room, is at risk of developing the disease if they are not immunised.""These are the same measures we had to put in place during the outbreaks of 2014 and 2015. We learnt very early that we had to be very strict with the quarantine and, by being strict, it will prevent further cases at the school,"" Dumble said.""It's a timely reminder to everyone else to check that they and their children are fully immunised against measles. Vaccination affords full immunity in the vast majority of cases.""                  Information has been circulated regarding the cases to the hospital emergency department and general practices in the region.""Measles can be a very serious illness, with 1 in 3 sufferers experiencing complications such as ear infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, or diarrhoea. On average, 1 in 10 cases will require hospitalisation,"" Dumble said.In 2014, there were 124 cases of measles in Hamilton [NZ] associated with an outbreak.Non-immunised people who have had contact with a person with measles will normally be advised to stay at home and away from all public places, school, or work for 14 days after contact.""Immunisation protects not only the individual, but also blocks the spread of this disease within our communities.""Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease. The disease is spread by tiny droplets in the air and is one of the few diseases that can spread easily to those nearby.Those who have had the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination are considered immune. People most at risk of contracting the disease are those who have either not had the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine, or who have just had one dose of the vaccine. If exposed, there are a number of measles symptoms to look out for.The 1st symptoms of measles are a fever and one or more of a runny nose, cough and sore, red eyes. After a few days, a red blotchy rash comes on, usually starting on the face before spreading to the body. The infection lasts up to 1 week.The incubation period for measles is approximately 2 weeks, meaning it can take up to 2 weeks from exposure to show symptoms.Measles can be very serious. If you or your child becomes unwell, phone (don't visit) your GP or call the Health Line on 0800 611 116 for advice, or otherwise seek medical attention.It is important to call first because measles is highly infectious and people with measles can infect others around them, such as in waiting rooms of GP surgeries or the emergency department.[Byline: Donna-Lee Biddle]--Communicated by:ProMED mail from Healthmap Alertspromed@promed.org[Waikato  is a local government region of the upper North Island of New Zealand.] - Mod.

Physicians in Karachi and interior Sindh are informally reporting many measles cases. Though the case fatality rate is not yet known, typically in settings of high malnutrition, 5% to 10% of the affected children die. These outbreaks occur every 2 -- 3 years in Sindh.The measles vaccine is included in the free routine immunisation programme for children in Pakistan; they are supposed to receive at least 2 doses of the measles vaccine. The 1st dose is given at 9 months and the 2nd during the 2nd year of life. Unfortunately, the coverage of the vaccine is low, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, and over time the pool of susceptible population increases, and when this pool reaches the critical threshold, a measles outbreak ensues.Let's take the hypothetical district X in Sindh with a population of 100 000 and an annual birth cohort of 3000. According to the last Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, immunisation coverage in Sindh was 29%, against a target of over 85%. We know that 1 dose when administered at nine months is 85% effective in producing immunity. Hence, in our example, if 29% of the 3000 infants born that year received the vaccine that is 85% effective, 740 infants would be protected and 2260 unprotected.The government's response has been slow this time------------------------------------------------These numbers will double the following year. A measles outbreak typically occurs when the pool of unprotected children is more or less equal to the annual birth cohort of that community. Hence we'd expect a measles outbreak every 2 --3 years in district X.So if we are witnessing a measles outbreak, we must follow WHO guidelines related to its control. The steps involved include: real-time surveillance and reporting of cases; strengthening case management including provision of 2 doses of vitamin A to all cases; focused supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) in affected areas; strengthening routine immunisation in affected areas; and an appropriate communication strategy for the public.Given that there is no strong system for raising the alarm against outbreaks in Sindh, the government's response this time has been relatively slow. A few mop-up vaccination campaigns are now planned in affected union councils of Karachi, but more urgency is required. Equally important is a long-term field-based surveillance system, so future outbreaks of infectious and other diseases can be promptly flagged.Our focus on polio eradication is often taken as an excuse for not investing resources in other vaccine-preventable diseases. The polio eradication programme should in fact be leveraged to tackle other vaccine-preventable illnesses in a better way, eg combined national SIAs against measles and polio at least once a year.The predictably recurrent measles outbreaks point towards another systems-level problem in our measles-control strategy. Like all WHO member countries, Pakistan's immunisation programme has 2 doses of measles vaccine to be given to all children.While the 1st dose in most developing countries is given at 9 months, there are 2 choices on how to administer the 2nd dose. In countries with well-functioning immunisation programmes where coverage of the 1st dose of measles vaccine is more than 85%, it is recommended that the 2nd dose be administered as part of the routine schedule, eg 15 months, to all children. In countries where immunisation coverage is not up to standard (Sindh has a coverage rate of 29%, Balochistan 16%), it is recommended that the 2nd dose be given via regular (eg yearly) mass immunisation campaigns or SIAs.During these mass campaigns, all children of a pre-specified age, usually between 6 months and 5 years, are given a dose of measles vaccine irrespective of their previous vaccination history. This approach is better for areas of low-performing immunisation programmes since SIAs are usually focused and cover a much larger proportion of children than those covered by the routine programme.Despite having the last reported coverage of only 29% in Sindh and 16pc in Balochistan, these provinces continue to follow the routine schedule for the second dose of measles. The last large-scale nation-wide measles SIA in Sindh was conducted in 2014 but the coverage was questionable.It is true that regular mass immunisation campaigns are expensive because they require a high level of operational commitment and resources, but we have no other choice until our routine coverage of vaccines exceeds 85pc. Our choice until the time till coverage rates are improved is either to conduct regular, high-quality mass immunisation campaigns against measles or accept that our children will continue to die of measles every couple of years during inevitable outbreaks.[Byline: Asad Ali  asad.ali@aku.edu]--Communicated by:Promed-mailpromed@promedmail.org[Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan and the capital of Pakistani province of Sindh.The report above states WHO guidelines as ""strengthening case management including provision of two doses of vitamin A to all cases.""Vitamin A deficiency is a recognized risk factor for severe measles and since 1987 the WHO and UNICEF have recommended vitamin A treatment of children with measles.(70 ) We performed a meta-analysis of six vitamin A treatment RCTs with measles-specific mortality data and found no significant reduction in measles morality [RR 0.63; 95% CI (0.37-1.08)]. However, when stratifying the analysis by vitamin A treatment dose, at least two doses of 200 000 IU for children ä´1 year of age and 100 000 IU for infants was found to reduce measles mortality by 62% [RR 0.38; 95% CI (0.18-0.81)]. These results support the current recommendation that two doses of vitamin A be offered to children with measles.7 An exception to Rule 0 (at least 50 deaths needed) was deemed appropriate with support of CHERG due to the high quality.See full paper with references at: Sudfeld CR et al.  2010.
