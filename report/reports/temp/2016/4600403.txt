The following day, a WHO official in Yemen said there was ""no spread of the disease"", Reuters reported.But Friday, 28 Oct 2016, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva news briefing that as of 27 Oct 2016 there were 1410 suspected cholera cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates -- mostly in Taiz, Aden, Lahij, Hudaydah and Sana'a.WHO said Wednesday, 26 Oct 2016, that only 47 of the suspected cases had tested positive for cholera and the outbreak had spread beyond the capital to 9 other governorates. Children under 10 accounted for half of the cases with 6 deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea, the WHO said in the 26 Oct 2016 report.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but are likely to continue to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
