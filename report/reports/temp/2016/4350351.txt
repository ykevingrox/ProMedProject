Richardson, Stanford University, Partners in Health presentation (22-25 Feb 2016). ""Unreported cases and asymptomatic infection in an Ebola 'hotspot'."" <http://www.croiwebcasts.org/console/player/29567?mediaType=audio&>.New research suggests that 10s of 1000s of survivors could have come into close contact with patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), not been aware of the exposure, and still be carriers in other areas of the body, including the testes, semen, eyes and nervous system.There are at least 17 000 Ebola survivors in West Africa. Since the beginning of the EVD outbreak, in response to stigmatization of EVD survivors who attempted to resume their life, health professionals have encouraged communities to reintegrate survivors. Although many describe lingering symptoms (60 percent have eye inflammation -- uveitis -- and 66 percent report neurological difficulties like insomnia and memory loss), doctors insisted they were free from Ebolavirus (EBOV).After testing a village residents' blood for EBOV antibodies, the research team found that 29 percent of people who appeared to have had EBOV had not only gone undiagnosed, they had never experienced any symptoms. Other studies have shown rates of the undiagnosed up to 70 percent.According to Eugene T. Richardson, in his Partners in Health presentation, ""My conservative estimate would be that there were at least 50 000 [symptomatic] cases, and if you add another 29 percent for asymptomatic infections, it's reasonable to say it could even be up to, say, 65 000 transmission episodes.""Researchers are now debating whether asymptomatic Ebola survivors could also be carrying active EBOV. There is evidence that fear of Ebola survivors, part of the folk wisdom of Sierra Leone, may have a function in preventing new outbreaks.Doctors and scientists have determined some survivors still carry active EBOV in the immune-privileged parts of their body, such as the inner eye and/or testes, where antigens can survive without immune-system detection, which could possibly allow EBOV to be passed on to others. Therefore, survivors could potentially be the source of another EVD outbreak.]15 Jul 2016: Sierra Leone stops mandatory testing of corpses for Ebola<http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/sierra-leone-stops-mandatory-testing-of-corpses-for-ebola/article/470123>[On Fri [15 Jul 2016], Sierra Leone officials said [the country] would stop the mandatory testing of all dead bodies for the Ebola virus, lifting a restriction put in place at the end of an outbreak that claimed thousands of lives.The World Health Organization [WHO] said on [17 Mar 2016] there were no more known cases of the virus in the country, which surfaced in neighboring Guinea before spreading to Sierra Leone in May 2014.Swabs of saliva were ordered to be systematically taken from any recently deceased person from November 2015, as part of a period of heightened surveillance following the successful containment of the virus.However, the director of Sierra Leone's Public Health Emergency Operation Center, Foday Dafae, now says ""Only deaths that meet the criteria set by the Ministry of Health will be investigated and swabbed"", rather than every single corpse.Dafae cautioned ""We still want people to report all deaths so that we can (maintain) surveillance and monitor all infectious diseases, which is a key to prevent any outbreak materializing.""]Research--------14 Jul 2016: Ebola virus related encephalitis<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/13/cid.ciw469.abstract>[Citation: De Greslan M., Billhot M., Rousseau, C., et al.

(14 Jul 2016). Undiscovered bat hosts of filoviruses. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004815 Research by an international team of ecologists has identified the bat species with the greatest potential to harbor filoviruses, a family which includes Ebola virus. Writing in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, they suggest areas where many of these species overlap, notably in Southeast Asia, should be targeted for disease surveillance and virus discovery efforts.According to the research paper's lead author, Barbara Han of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, ""Understanding which species carry these viruses, and where they are located, is essential to preventing future spillovers. Using machine learning methods developed for artificial intelligence, we were able to bring together data from ecology, biogeography and public health to identify bat species with a high probability of harboring the Ebola virus and other filoviruses."" Identifying which species serve as reservoirs is critical for preventing future Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks.Filoviruses, which originate in animals and can be transmitted to humans, are a serious threat to human health and to primate conservation. EVD has a 50 percent human fatality rate, according to the World Health Organization, and among great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees that rate is even higher.Han and colleagues from the University of Georgia and Massey University in New Zealand set out to develop a ""trait profile"" of filovirus-susceptible bats. They were able to distinguish several from other bats with 87 percent accuracy. These include earlier maturity, more frequent litters, and pups that are larger at birth. Their geographic ranges are also larger, and overlap with more mammal species, than those of other bats.AbstractEbola and other filoviruses pose significant public health and conservation threats by causing high mortality in primates, including humans. Preventing future outbreaks of ebolavirus depends on identifying wildlife reservoirs, but extraordinarily high biodiversity of potential hosts in temporally dynamic environments of equatorial Africa contributes to sporadic, unpredictable outbreaks that have hampered efforts to identify wild reservoirs for nearly 40 years. Using a machine learning algorithm, generalized boosted regression, we characterize potential filovirus-positive bat species with estimated 87 percent accuracy. Our model produces 2 specific outputs with immediate utility for guiding filovirus surveillance in the wild. First, we report a profile of intrinsic traits that discriminates hosts from non-hosts, providing a biological caricature of a filovirus-positive bat species. This profile emphasizes traits describing adult and neonate body sizes and rates of reproductive fitness, as well as species' geographic range overlap with regions of high mammalian diversity. Second, we identify several bat species ranked most likely to be filovirus-positive on the basis of intrinsic trait similarity with known filovirus-positive bats. New bat species predicted to be positive for filoviruses are widely distributed outside of equatorial Africa, with a majority of species overlapping in Southeast Asia. Taken together, these results spotlight several potential host species and geographical regions as high-probability targets for future filovirus surveillance.]15 Jul 2016: 23 Africa states risk Ebola transmission by animals<http://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/health/23-africa-states-risk-ebola-transmission-animals/317514/>[Citation: Pigott D.M., Millear A.I., Earl L., et al. (14 Jul 2016). Updates to the zoonotic niche map of Ebola virus disease in Africa. eLife 2016;5:e16412 . DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16412>According to the findings published in the journal eLife, although the West African Ebola outbreak that began in 2013 is now under control, 23 countries in Africa remain environmentally suitable for animal-to-human transmission of the Ebola virus. Only 7 of these countries have experienced cases of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] leaving the remaining 16 countries potentially unaware of regions of suitability, and are under-prepared for future outbreaks.Only a few of the countries saw cases of Ebola before 2013, until Guinea unexpectedly reported an outbreak that led to more than 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths across West Africa. The study was led by researchers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle.The current study provides an update on a study published in 2014 that created a zoonotic niche map used to define areas of environmental suitability for Ebola in response to the outbreak.This map identified regions where EVD could be transmitted from animals to humans. The updated map incorporates more species of bats likely capable of transmitting Ebola, as well as new reports of EVD.According to the map, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo and mainland Equatorial Guinea are now predicted to be more environmentally suitable than in the previous analysis. The regions of Central Africa (particularly Gabon and the Republic of Congo) are identified as being most environmentally suitable for zoonotic EVD transmission in the previous analysis remain so in this analysis. The revised number of predicted at-risk countries is 23.These countries are Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, South Sudan, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Liberia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Angola, Togo, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania, Burundi, Mozambique, Madagascar, Kenya and Malawi.AbstractAs the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa is now contained, attention is turning from control to future outbreak prediction and prevention. Building on a previously published zoonotic niche map (Pigott et al., 2014), this study incorporates new human and animal occurrence data and expands upon the way in which potential bat EVD reservoir species are incorporated. This update demonstrates the potential for incorporating and updating data used to generate the predicted suitability map. A new data portal for sharing such maps is discussed. This output represents the most up-to-date estimate of the extent of EVD zoonotic risk in Africa. These maps can assist in strengthening surveillance and response capacity to contain viral hemorrhagic fevers.]History-------14 Jul 2016: History credits this man with discovering Ebola on his own. History is wrong<https://www.statnews.com/2016/07/14/history-ebola-peter-piot/>[A very interesting article on the discovery of Ebola in 1976 is recommended reading. Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is credited frequently on the internet with this discovery. In addition, he published a memoir in 2012, ""No Time To Lose: A Life in Pursuit of Deadly Viruses,"" for which Amazon includes in its blurb, that he even named the virus.But the story is more complicated, as scientific intrigues always are. The author of the report, Helen Branswell, states that ""Piot did not discover Ebola on his own -- and depending on how you define discovery, may not be able to actually make the claim at all. He definitely did not choose the name Ebola."" Instead, credit for the discovery should go to Dr. Karl Johnson, then head of special pathogens; Dr. Patricia Webb, a virologist ...; James Lange, a CDC scientist who was involved in the fight against the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak; and Frederick Murphy, then chief of the viral pathology branch. Murphy took the iconic picture of the virus that is still used.][Submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall][Compiled by Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>.ProMED HealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54> Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>- Mod.LK][See Also:Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924Ebola update (46): Liberia, Sierra Leone, treatment comment, research, funding 20160626.4310569Ebola update (45): Liberia, vaccine, treatment, funding, research 20160619.4296380Ebola update (44): Liberia, WHO, funding, research 20160612.4283379Ebola update (43): digital wallet response, Guinea, diagnostic assay 20160605.4266788Ebola update (42): Guinea, vaccine, research 20160529.4253046Ebola update (41): update, funding 20160522.4238249Ebola update (40): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, vaccines 20160514.4222416Ebola update (39): Guinea persistence in semen, Liberia, research, vaccine 20160508.4209313Ebola update (38): WHO sitrep. evolution rate, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160501.4195742Ebola update (37): Guinea, Liberia, diagnostics, vaccine, funding, research 20160427.4187854Ebola update (36): Guinea, Liberia, vaccine, research 20160421.4172812Ebola update (35): vaccine, comment 20160418.4167038Ebola update (34): Guinea, Liberia, comment, vaccine funding 20160417.4165862Ebola update (33): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160413.4158203Ebola update (32): Liberia, Guinea, support 20160410.4150454Ebola update (31): Liberia, Guinea re-emergence, research, funding 20160406.4142990Ebola update (30): Liberia re-emergence, Uganda NOT, RFI 20160404.4136987Ebola update (29): Liberia re-emergence, Guinea contacts, news, RFI 20160402.4134878Ebola update (28): news, research, vaccine 20160330.4128527Ebola update (27): Ebola Reston virulence, Africa suspicious deaths RFI, news 20160327.4121931Ebola update (26): Guinea flare-up, Liberia 20160324.4114807Ebola update (25): Guinea flare-up, Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160320.4107350Ebola update (24): Guinea, confirmed 20160317.4101955Ebola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040Ebola update (22): long-term sequelae, news, research 20160313.4090091Ebola update (21): Sierra Leone, herd immunity, possible new drug 20160310.4081498Ebola update (20): new antiviral, prevention 20160306.4073116Ebola update (19): WHO, relapse in UK (Scotland), prevention, research, funding 20160302.4064754Ebola update (18): WHO, susp, research, funding, NGO, corr 20160229.4058786Ebola update (17): UK nurse readmitted, EVD survivor complications, research 20160224.4047552Ebola update (16): WHO comment, funding, vaccine 20160221.4039174Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, vaccine 20160218.4030271Ebola update (14): research, funding, vaccine, NGO 20160214.4021318Ebola update (13): rapid test, research, funding 20160210.4010884Ebola update (12): Sierra Leone, research, funding, vaccine 20160207.4002006Ebola update (11): Sierra Leone, new case, controversy 20160203.3990396Ebola update (10): Sierra Leone, vaccine, funding 20160131.3981594Ebola update (09): funding, correction 20160127.3970963Ebola update (08): Sierra Leone, vaccine, research, video 20160124.3962240Ebola update (07): Sierra Leone, 2nd new case 20160121.3955860Ebola update (06): 5 mysteries about EVD, Sierra Leone new case, followup 20160117.3944673Ebola update (05): WHO declares Liberia free, Sierra Leone new case 20160115.3938471Ebola update (04): WHO, prevention, research, drugs & vaccines 20160113.3933860Ebola update (03): WHO, prevention, survivors, stigma, research, drugs, vaccines 20160110.3924235Ebola update (02): WHO, monitoring, lessons, research 20160106.3915785Ebola update (01): management, vaccine, treatment, monitoring 20160103.3908196].................................................lk/je/ml"
