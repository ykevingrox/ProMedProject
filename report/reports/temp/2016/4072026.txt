A class IV employee succumbed to the infection in February 2016, but hospital officials said that he lived in Badlapur and may have contracted the virus there. ""Two resident doctors are admitted in the hospital at the moment, but they are stable,"" said one of the student doctors. ""The outbreak came to light when the class-IV employee died in the hospital, followed by 15 residents and 5 nurses falling ill since then,"" he added.The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) asked the hospital to take steps to contain the hepatitis E outbreak. ""It's shameful that 2 outbreaks of hepatitis E have taken place in such a short period in a hospital premises. It's high time the administration took the issue seriously,"" said MARD's Dr Sagar Mundada.Nair dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said the reports are ""exaggerated."" He said a few patients, including 7 resident doctors, were admitted last month [February 2015]. ""The water sources have been tested and tanks cleaned.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Fecal contamination of the water supplies is the most common mode of transmission. It appears that person-to-person transmission of HEV is not as frequent as with hepatitis A. Vertical transmission of HEV does occur, however. A cluster such as this one suggests contaminated water, but if no patient cases are found, the source may be specific to healthcare worker eating/drinking - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/310>.]
