Food Poisoning Bulletin [edited]<https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2016/7-state-salmonella-outbreak-linked-to-garden-of-life-shake-mixes/>Garden of Life meal replacement shake mixes have been identified as the source of a 7-state _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Virchow outbreak, according to the Minnesota Department of Health announced on 29 Jan 2016. At least 8 people have been sickened. Because many cases of salmonellosis are not reported, the number is likely to be much higher. Minnesota health officials said they wanted to ""bring this outbreak to the attention of people who have become ill with symptoms of salmonellosis but who have not yet consulted a health care provider. These people should mention this outbreak to their health care provider should they consult one.""In Minnesota, where between 700 and 900 cases of salmonellosis are reported annually, 2 cases have been reported since Monday, 11 Jan 2016. 1 case was a child and the other was an adult in his 30s. Neither required hospitalization and both have recovered. Other cases have been reported in Wisconsin, Tennessee, Oregon, New Jersey, New Mexico and Utah. There has been at least 1 case reported form each of those states.Product testing is underway in Minnesota, where 1 of the case patients ate vanilla-flavored product and 1 ate chocolate-flavored product. Those flavors were also reported by case patients in other states. Results from those tests will be available in the coming days. Cases in other states reported eating the vanilla flavor or the chocolate flavor. This type of food product is often purchased at nutrition stores and food cooperatives. The 2 cases in Minnesota purchased the items at separate places.Garden of Life issued a recall for the products yesterday, 29 Jan 2016. It includes all flavors purchased on or after 1 Nov 2015 marked with a ""Best Used by:"" date of  09/2017 on the bottom of the container.  The products were sold at better health food stores and natural grocers nationwide.In the recall issued yesterday, 29 Jan 2016, the company stated it had tested all lots of the product before distributing them to better health food stores and natural grocers nationwide. None of the tests was positive for Salmonella, according to the company. The FDA is also investigating the outbreak.[Byline: Carla Gillespie]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The scope of this just-reported outbreak is awaited.
