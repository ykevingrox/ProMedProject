CPH Post Online [edited]<http://cphpost.dk/news/respiratory-infection-outbreak-hits-denmark.html>A growing number of Danes have been diagnosed with a contagious respiratory infection, _Mycoplasma [pneumoniae_] pneumonia (MP), in the past few weeks, reports Statens Serum Institute (SSI).""We believe [the situation has already reached the level of] an epidemic, because there has been a sharp increase in the number of samples tested positive for MP,"" SÌüren Anker Uldum, a senior researcher at SSI, told TV2. [The epidemic] is not spread evenly across the country, and we don't know if it will last for long."" According to SSI, the majority of cases have been recorded in the Capital Region and the Region of Northern Jutland, where 24 per cent of patients tested positive for mycoplasma in the past 4 weeks.Mycoplasma pneumonia is caused by the bacterium _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, which clings onto the lung tissue and multiplies until a full infection develops. It affects mostly young children, older adults and people with weak immune systems. The main symptoms include a dry cough, chest pain and fever, but, in rare cases, the infection can cause damage to the heart or central nervous system. Diagnosis in the early stages is difficult because of the 'mild' symptoms that resemble an ordinary cold.However, it is important to seek medical care because MP can only be treated with antibiotics. Because of the coughing, it is easy for the infection to spread from person to person. Proper hand-washing and avoiding closed spaces with many people is recommended.[byline: Lucie Rychla]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post: Mycoplasma pneumoniae - China: (HK) schoolchildren 20141213.3031474:_M. pneumoniae_ accounts for 15-20 per cent of community-acquired lower respiratory infection in adults that require hospitalization and probably an even greater proportion of those that do not require hospitalization. About 20 per cent of infections are asymptomatic. Extrapulmonary syndromes, including cardiologic (for example, pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmias), neurologic (for example, encephalitis), hematologic (hemolysis), and dermatologic findings (erythema multiforme) may occur rarely. Cold agglutinins may be present in the acute serum of 30-60 per cent of patients.Transmission of _M. pneumoniae_ infections probably occurs through close contact with contaminated respiratory droplets. Infections with _M. pneumoniae_ occur sporadically throughout the year, and outbreaks are commonest during the late summer and early fall, typically in 4-7 year cycles (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00022322.htm>). Spread of infection is common in households, schools, college dormitories and military bases where people are living together in close proximity. The prolonged incubation period for this pathogen of 2-4 weeks may contribute to protracted duration of outbreaks. Because _M. pneumoniae_ infection most commonly causes upper respiratory illness (only an estimated 3-10 per cent of persons with infection experience pneumonia), infected persons often go about their normal activities and infect others.Macrolides, tetracyclines (doxycycline), fluoroquinolones have been the antimicrobials of choice for _M. pneumoniae_ infections. However, macrolide resistance has been reported and appears be increasing (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2223908/> and <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/6/10-1558_article.htm>). A real-time PCR assay has been developed to detect in clinical specimens the mutations that confer macrolide resistance in _M. pneumoniae_ (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565909/>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/111>.]
