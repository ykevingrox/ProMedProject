Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-cholera-idUSKBN1391H5>Yemen is at risk of a significant cholera outbreak with the number of suspected cases doubling within 12 days to over 4000, the World Health Organization said.The outbreak in a country ravaged by a 20-month war that has killed thousands was declared by Yemen's Health Ministry on 6 Oct 2016. By 1 Nov 2016 there were 2070 suspected cases, rising to 4119 by Sun 13 Nov 2016. ""The numbers of cholera cases in Yemen continue to increase, sparking concerns of a significant outbreak,"" the WHO said in a report on Mon 14 Nov 2016. Cases confirmed as cholera by laboratory testing rose to 86 from 71 on 1 Nov 2016. Up to 8 people have died in the outbreak, as well as 56 from acute diarrhea [many, if not all, of these were cholera as well. - Mod.LL].Yemen is already beset by humanitarian problems arising from the war between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls much of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. The war has destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure, killed more than 10 000 people and displaced millions. The United Nations says only 45 percent of health facilities are functional and 2-thirds of the population has no access to safe drinking water or sanitation.The WHO said the largest cholera caseload was in the governorates of Taiz and of Aden, the site of the government's temporary capital. But deaths due to cholera have also been confirmed in Amran, Sanaa, Hajjah and Ibb, and there are 29 ""hot"" districts in the country, with 11 governorates affected so far, the report said.The UN estimates the cholera caseload in Yemen could end up as high as 76 000 across 15 governorates.[Byline: Tom Miles and John Stonestreet]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but total numbers are likely to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman.Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen>. - Mod.LL]*****[2] Cholera - Ghana (Central Region)Date: Mon 14 Nov 2016, 11:00 AMSource: Citi FM Online, a Graphic Online report [edited]<http://citifmonline.com/2016/11/14/central-region-records-268-cholera-cases/>Reported cases of cholera in the Central Region has hit 268 as of last Tue [8 Nov 2016] evening. No deaths had been recorded. This was made known by the Central Regional Director of Health Services, Dr Samuel Kwashie. He said the cases were from the Cape Coast metropolis predominantly, particularly from the Abura and Pedu suburbs.At a meeting with the Central Regional Coordinating Council to give a brief on the state of the outbreak last Thu [10 Nov 2016], Dr Kwashie said the health authorities and partners had intensified education on the disease in churches, schools, mosques and at funeral grounds, in an effort to contain its spread. He commended health authorities in the region and some partners for the absence of fatalities since the outbreak of the disease.The Central Region is the only region to have recorded an outbreak of cholera in 2016. Out of the reported cases, 261 are from the Cape Coast metropolis, while 5 are from the Abura Asebu-Kwamankese District. The Asikuma Odoben Brakwa District and Komenda Edina Eguafo Abrem Municipality have reported 1 case each. Dr Kwashie, however, intimated that almost all the cases reported outside of Cape Coast were linked to the metropolis in a way. ""Victims in almost all of the cases reported outside of Cape Coast passed through the metropolis and might have taken in food or something in the area,"" he said. He urged residents in the region to be mindful of what they bought and ate.Dr Kwashie said 6 committees had been established to contain the situation. The committees, he said, included that on logistics, water, sanitation and hygiene, surveillance, case management communication and coordination. He commended the Ministry of Health, the Regional Coordinating Council and all the partners in health for their support.In 2015, 18 cases of cholera were reported in the region. The region had 3846 cases of the disease during a national outbreak in 2014, with 60 deaths. It was the worst outbreak in a decade. There were no cases of the disease in 2013. However, in 2012, there were 108 cases with 12 deaths and 588 cases in 2011 with 11 deaths.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Central Region of Ghana is in south Ghana and can be found at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Region_(Ghana)#/media/File:Ghana_-_Central.svg>. - Mod.LL]*****[3] Cholera - South SudanDate: Tue 8 Nov 2016, 6:35 PMSource: Asharq Al-Awsat [edited]<http://english.aawsat.com/2016/11/article55361752/cholera-cases-south-sudan-increase-unprecedentedly>Over 3000 people in Sudan have had cholera since July 2016, the WHO reported on Tue [8 Nov 2016], warning that the outbreak had now spread to a region where conflict is hampering efforts to tackle the deadly disease. ""Unity State is where we're focusing our efforts now. There is an active conflict so it is not easy to control but we are doing our best,"" said Usman Abdulmumini, WHO South Sudan country representative.An intestinal infection often linked to contaminated drinking water, cholera causes diarrhea and vomiting, leaving small children especially vulnerable to death from dehydration. The outbreak has caused 44 deaths and spread to 9 of South Sudan's 28 states, WHO said. But Abdulmumini said the disease was no longer spreading in the capital Juba which has accounted for about 2 thirds of cases. ""The outbreak continues but the good news is that we have controlled it in most of the states,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. ""We are not afraid that it is getting out of hand.""Unity State has experienced some of the worst violence since fighting erupted in South Sudan at the end of 2013 between soldiers loyal to President Salva Kiir and those backing his former deputy Riek Machar. The pair signed a shaky peace deal last year [2015] but violence continues. The conflict has killed thousands, uprooted nearly 2.5 million people and fueled a major hunger crisis. More than 6.1 million are in need of aid, according to the International Organization for Migration. The U.N. children's agency UNICEF warned in July 2016 that the cholera outbreak could lead to a devastating loss of life if it spread to conflict-hit states where many health facilities have been closed or destroyed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The states of South Sudan can be seen on a map at:< http://bit.ly/2fuNBU9> - Mod.LL]*****[4] Cholera - Congo DR (Tanganyika Province)Date: Thu 10 Nov 2016, 12:46 PMSource: Radio Okapi [in French, machine trans., edited]<http://www.radiookapi.net/2016/11/10/actualite/en-bref/tanganyika-11-personnes-meurent-de-cholera-en-deux-semaines-mwenge>A total of 11 people suffering from cholera have died in 2 weeks in the locality of Mwenge (Tanganyika province).
