The Indian Express [edited]<http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/odisha-japanese-encephalitis-death-toll-nhrc-3065863/>The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on [Tue 4 Oct 2016] served notice to the Malkangiri district [Odisha] administration and the health secretary of Odisha as the death toll due to Japanese encephalitis rose to 30 in just about a month.Asking the officials to submit a detailed report, including steps being taken by them, within 4 weeks, the NHRC said there was an urgent need to create awareness among villagers over the tradition of rearing pigs.Though officials are taking steps to contain the epidemic, a 2-year-old child of Badali under Korukonda block died on Monday night [3 Oct 2016]. A 3-year-old child of Namkonda under Kalimela block and a 2-year-old girl of Uskapali in Korukonda block died at the Malkangiri district headquarters hospital on [Tue 4 Oct 2016]. The condition of 4 more children is said to be critical.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of fatalities in this area continues to increase, climbing from 27 to 30 in the past 2 days, with 4 additional individuals hospitalized. Health officials are becoming concerned with this trend and have focused preventive efforts on village pigs. This is a reasonable worry, since pigs are amplifying hosts of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and moving them out of villages and away could reduce the risk of contact with JE virus infected vector mosquitoes. However, it seems curious that no mention is made of vaccination. That would be the most effective measure for prevention of JE in this susceptible population.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170>. - Mod.TY]
