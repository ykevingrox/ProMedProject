Vector Borne & Zoonotic Diseases [edited]<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26720232>Human Cutaneous Anthrax, the East Anatolian Region of Turkey 2008-2014. Parlak E, Parlak M. Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Ataturk University Faculty of Medicine, Erzurum, Turkey.Abstract-------Anthrax is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_. While anthrax is rare in developed countries, it is endemic in Turkey. The names of the different forms of the disease refer to the manner of entry of the spores into the body: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, inhalation, and injection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, treatment, and outcomes of patients with [cutaneous] anthrax.82 cases of anthrax hospitalized at Ataturk University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology in 2008-2014 were examined retrospectively. Gender, age, occupation, year, history, clinical characteristics, character of lesions, length of hospitalization, and outcomes were recorded. 30 (36.6 percent) patients were female, and 52 (63.4 percent) patients were male; ages were 18-69 and mean age was 43.77 13.05. The mean incubation period was 4.79 plus/minus 3.76 days. Cases were largely identified in August (41.5 percent) and September (25.6 percent). 69 (84.1 percent) of the 82 patients had been given antibiotics before presentation. Lesions were most common on the fingers and arms. The most common occupational groups were housewives (36.6 percent) and people working in animal husbandry (31.7 percent).All patients had histories of contact with diseased animals and animal products. Penicillin-group antibiotics (78 percent) were most commonly used in treatment. One patient (1.2 percent) died from anthrax meningitis. The mean length of hospitalization was 8.30 plus/minus 5.36 days.Anthrax is an endemic disease of economic and social significance for the region. Effective public health control measures, risk group education, vaccination of animals, and decontamination procedures will reduce the number of cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[During the period 2008-2014, there were 1123 human cases of anthrax in Turkey as a whole with 5 deaths, and just 150 human cases with one death. The 2014 monthly animal outbreak pattern was January (5 livestock outbreaks), February (3), March (6), April (8), May (1), June (4), July (21), August (19), September (18), October (6), November (3), December (1) -- not atypical in the northern latitudes -- for a total of 95 livestock outbreaks that involved 259 bovine cases, 49 sheep and goats, and 4 horses. For a map of Turkey showing Eastern Anatolia go to: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Anatolia_Region>.Of the provinces that are entirely in the Eastern Anatolia Region: Agri had 2 livestock outbreaks in 2014; Bingol (0), Elazig (3), Hakkari (0), Igdir (0), Kars (19), Tunceli (0), Van (1), and of the provinces that are mostly in the Eastern Anatolia Region: Ardahan (3), Erzurum (12), and Sirnak (1). So one can see that the risk of human anthrax in this region of Turkey is very high, and it would not be inappropriate to describe the human appreciation of this risk as careless, and at a high cost. In any year, multiple provinces suffer livestock outbreaks; in 2014, 37 provinces had one or more outbreaks. In 2013, there were 34 provinces with cattle outbreaks and in 2012 31 provinces with bovine outbreaks. This disease is hyper-endemic in Turkey. This pattern has persisted for decades. From previous publications, it is clear that the Turkish medical profession is not unaware of the problem; see 20101119.4201. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/87>.]
