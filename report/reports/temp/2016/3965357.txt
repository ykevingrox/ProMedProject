Representatives of civil society, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef)), are also expected to attend the event.The Provincial Government learnt of the existence of yellow fever outbreak in Luanda on [20 Jan 2016] following the final result of the tests sent to the WHO reference laboratory in Dakar, Senegal, by the WHO. The investigation of these cases began on 30 Dec 2015, pointing to 6 cases that resulted in deaths of 4 Eritrean citizens aged between 22 and 34 years old in Viana municipality [Luanda province].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Tue 26 Jan 2016Source: Angola Press Agency (Angop) [edited]<http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/saude/2016/0/4/Angola-Health-Minister-announces-intensification-fight-against-vectors,0dcbec36-eff2-4420-99c9-4ebf66b91024.html>The minister of Health, Jose Van-Dunem, announced [Mon 25 Jan 2016] in Luanda the reactivation of the anti-vectorial fight, from the point of view of anti-larval and inside and outside home spraying in order to prevent and combat yellow fever [YF] and its [vector] mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_.Jose Van-Dunem said so when addressing a meeting chaired by the governor of Luanda [province], Higino Carneiro, on the outbreak of yellow fever that is ravaging Viana municipality, which was reported since 30 Dec 2015 with a record of 99 cases, of which 26 are validated [confirmed] with 8 deaths.The clinical condition of patients was characterized by a feverish syndrome of jaundice, bleeding in individuals aged between 22 and 34 years old, of Eritrean nationality, residing approximately 8 months in Viana and who were working at kilometer 30. [There is no mention of how long the Congolese cases had been living there. - Mod.JW]According to the minister, the administrators and members of neighborhoods should talk more with their respective citizens because the ponds [water catchments] are in the houses of each one, the water in [discarded] tires, bottles, vases, and every one of us has to do their best so that the mosquito cannot find a favourable environment for its multiplication.In addition to the fight against _Ae. aegypti_ mosquito that carries yellow fever, he said, ""We also have to fight against malaria, common denominator in all municipalities that leads to anemia and high parasitaemia.""The meeting was attended by the representative of the World Health Organization WHO), Hernando Agudelo, deputy governors, municipal administrators, health officials, and religious entities.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*******[3] Date: Wed 27 Jan 2016Source: Angola Press Agency (Angop) [edited]<http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/saude/2016/0/4/Health-sector-runs-workshop-yellow-fever,179cd5d0-2925-429a-853e-4d1c735b25a2.html>Experts from Luanda-based hospitals, health centers and medical posts are expected to attend Fri [29 Jan 2016] an upgrading seminar on yellow fever hitting the country's capital, Luanda since December last year [2015]. -- more[The case count in here is out-of-date. - Mod.JW]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The original report of the yellow fever (YF) cases received on 22 Jan 2016 stated that there were 7 fatalities preliminarily diagnosed as YF (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160122.3958601). The fatal cases in that report were listed as Eritrean and Congolese citizens. The report above only mentions 6 cases with 4 deaths that were Eritrean, with no mention of the Congolese individuals. It is not clear if the other 17 cases and the other 3 fatalities also were tested at the Pasteur WHO reference laboratory in Dakar, Senegal.ProMED-mail reiterates its request for information, now that these cases have been confirmed as YF. It is important to know whether they involve the urban cycle of transmission. If these are urban cycle cases, implementation of vaccination and increased surveillance are urgent. Urban outbreaks can increase rapidly.ProMED-mail is also interested to know when the YF virus infections occurred, the age and sex of the cases, and details of the YF vaccination campaign planned (according to the previous report). - Mod.TYAlso according to the previous report, the cases are in Viana, a booming suburb of the capital, Luanda. Viana lies 15-30 km (9-18 mi) east of the capital Luanda and is home to 68 000 inhabitants including about 6000 long-term refugees, primarily from neighboring Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Viana is about a 90 minute drive from downtown Luanda (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viana,_Luanda>).As of 20 Jan 2016, there were 23 cases of yellow fever including 7 deaths of Eritrean (4) and Congolese (3) citizens (<http://allafrica.com/stories/201601221001.html>). Viana municipality has now reported 99 cases, of which 26 are validated [confirmed] with 8 deaths. Is there an unreported YF epidemic in DR Congo? When will Angola start to vaccinate? It requires 10 days for the vaccine to take effect, so to protect Luanda, vaccination should ideally have been started without waiting for confirmation from elsewhere. Countries receiving passengers from Angola should be checking the date on their YF vaccination certificates, but a lot of them are fake, obtained without getting vaccinated, which compounds the problem (see <http://www.redeangola.info/a-espera-da-oms-para-combater-o-surto-de-febre-amarela/> in Portuguese -- reported on ProMED/PORT).On 27 Jan 2016 ProMED contacted the WHO Geneva focal point for YF and learned that WHO is still waiting for official notification from Angola and a request for vaccine, but is aware of the epidemic. A WHO virologist and epidemiologist have arrived in Luanda and a WHO entomologist is expected to join them shortly.This sounds as though an urban epidemic has begun, with its international implications.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10684> and of Viana in relation to Luanda at <http://becoangola.com/imagens/viana.gif>. - Mod.JW]
