Last year [2015], the 51 cases of wild poliovirus reported here represented the bulk of all 70 [72, see section [3] below] cases reported throughout the world.Even so, last year's [2015] count is cause for optimism, since it was a huge drop from the 294 cases reported in Pakistan in 2014, and because it seems to be a product of some clever adjustments the country has made to its longstanding polio eradication programme, with help from the Pakistani Army and smartphone-based technology.Since 1978, the country has had an official Expanded Programme on Immunisation, in which vaccinators go door to door to immunise against many childhood and other diseases -- tuberculosis, hepatitis, meningitis, measles and more. But when the goal became finally stamping out the last traces of polio, the regimen had to be ramped up to include more than these periodic household visits.As part of the World Health Organisation's Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018, the government announced that [25 Apr 2016] will be a National Switch Day for updating the kind of vaccine used, to account for the fact that Types 2 and 3 of the polio virus appear to have already been eliminated in Pakistan, with only Type 1 remaining.Recognising that, the WHO recommended a switch from a trivalent oral polio vaccine to a version that can target Type 1 more effectively.Next milestone will be phasing out the oral vaccine, which is built from a weakened live virus, and replacing it with an inactive polio vaccine administered by injection. Starting in Punjab, that strategy will supplement live-virus vaccine schedule with one dose of the inactive version, which eliminates even the small risk of contracting the disease from live virus vaccine.One reason the inactive vaccine is coming into use only now is that it is 5 times more expensive than the live oral type. To overcome that obstacle, GAVI, a public-private organisation funded by various countries, charities and international institutions, will help cover the cost.At the same time, Pakistan's government has supplied vaccinators with motorcycles, for which Britain's Fund for International Development, along with UNICEF, will provide fuel allowances. Lack of fuel has been a popular excuse for vaccinators who miss their vaccine targets because they don't want to travel to the far-flung areas where they are most needed. Security for vaccinators is an even bigger issue, illustrated by the bombing last Wednesday [13 Jan 2016] of a polio eradication centre in Quetta that killed 14 policemen during an immunisation drive.
