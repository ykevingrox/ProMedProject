PAHO/WHO Zika Epidemiological Update [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=36241&lang=en>Zika virus -- Incidence and trends----------------------------------To date, 47 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus disease since 2015. In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases (Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America). Since the last Zika Epidemiological Update of 8 Sep 2016, Saint Kitts and Nevis has confirmed vector-borne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.Figure 1 [see URL for map].Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015-2016: Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; CuraÌ¤ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint BarthÌ©lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).Highlighted below is a summary of the Zika epidemiological situation by sub-regions of the Americas. North AmericaFrom the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico up to epidemiological weeks (EW) 34 there was an increasing trend of confirmed Zika cases, with a decreasing trend of cases in the last 3 weeks, (EW 34 to 36). The trend will have to be monitored to see if the decrease continues in the coming weeks. In the United States of America, the area of Zika transmission continues to expand with 3 counties in the state of Florida reporting autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection: Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Pinellas.Central AmericaIn Central America, an increasing trend of cases has been observed over the last 4 weeks in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Costa Rica continues to have an increasing trend in cases since the beginning of the outbreak up to EW 32, although in the preceding 2 weeks (EW 33 and 34) a decrease has been reported; it remains to be seen if this trend will continue. In Guatemala, following a downward trend that began on EW 23, the reported cases increased again in EW 32. In Nicaragua, the number of reported cases has mostly been on the rise since the beginning of the outbreak. In Panama, following a sharp decrease in cases since EW 23, an increase in cases has been observed as of EW 30. The greatest increase in Zika cases in Central America occurred between late 2015 and early 2016.CaribbeanIn the past 4 weeks Saint Martin, the French overseas territory, reported an increasing trend in cases after the decrease observed up to EW 32. Puerto Rico reflects a declining trend of Zika cases in the past 3 weeks, (EW 33 to EW 35), following the increase in number of cases observed since the beginning of the outbreak.However, the trend should be monitored over the following weeks to confirm if the declining trend continues in these countries/territories. Other countries/territories in the Caribbean also show a declining trend of Zika cases. South AmericaIn South America, all countries are reporting decreasing numbers of Zika cases. Congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection To date, 16 countries and territories in the Americas have reported confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. Since the last Zika Epidemiological Update of 8 Sep 2016, Guatemala has reported 17 confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika; the cases were confirmed by the national reference laboratory and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC). As of EW 35, Canada reported 2 maternal-fetal transmissions of Zika Virus; one with severe neurological anomalies. As of 1 Sep [2016], the table with the number of confirmed cases of congenital syndrome is published on a weekly basis on the PAHO/WHO website and is available at: <http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12390&Itemid=42090&lang=en> Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disordersTo date, 12 countries and territories in the Region have reported an increase in the number of cases of Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) and 8 countries and territories have reported laboratory-confirmed GBS cases associated with Zika virus infection (Table 1).
