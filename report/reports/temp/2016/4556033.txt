Pajhwok Afghan News [edited]<http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2016/10/10/moph-confirms-new-polio-case-paktika%E2%80%99s-birmal-district>A new polio case has been confirmed in south eastern Paktika province, taking the number of cases detected across the country during the current year to 8, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) said on Monday [10 Oct 2016].Announcing results of the final investigation of the 2 most recent incidents that were initially diagnosed as polio in the preliminary testing, the ministry said the case in Birmal district was positive. It was genetically linked to a virus from Pakistan's South Waziristan tribal region, whereas the case found in Kabul was confirmed negative, a statement from the ministry said.This brings the total number of polio cases to 8 in Afghanistan in 2016. In response to the transmission in Paktika, 2 supplementary immunization activity (SIA) campaigns have been conducted.The National Immunization Day is planned for [17 Oct 2016] to administer oral polio vaccines (OPV) to children along with de-worming tablets for those below 5 years of age.Afghanistan remains one of the last 3 polio-endemic countries in the world. The Ministry of Public Health and partners continue efforts towards polio eradication.--communicated by:ProMED-SoAs from HealthMap Alerts<promed-soas@promedmail.org>[While the news report above mentions 8 polio cases in 2016 in Afghanistan, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative reports 9 wild polio cases from Afghanistan as of 4 Oct 2016 (<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>).Since Afghanistan and Pakistan share borders with each other, both countries require sustained efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis from the region. - Mod.SNAs per Mod.SN above, according to the Polio Eradication Initiative's most recent report, there were 9 cases of polio confirmed in Afghanistan as of 4 Oct 2016, with the most recent date of onset being 10 Aug 2016. Presumably, this is a media report error.Paktika is located south east of Kabul and borders Pakistan; with communication between the 2 countries, it has not been unusual to find genetically related wild polioviruses in both countries (see <http://www.ephotopix.com/image/asia/afghanistan_province_color_map.gif> for a map showing provinces).A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Afghanistan can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56066>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Liberia, 6 cases suspected - media reportDate: 11 Oct 2016Source: Bush Chicken [edited]<http://www.bushchicken.com/health-authorities-suspect-cases-of-polio-in-nimba/>Six suspected cases of polio have been discovered in Nimba, according to county health officials. Dr Collins Saa Bowah, Nimba's county health officer, said 6 samples of suspected polio disease were collected during the recent polio immunization campaign in Nimba.Bowah said the samples, which were collected from different communities, have been sent to Monrovia for testing in a laboratory. He said the children from whom the samples were collected all became paralyzed between July and September of this year [2016], noting that such news is very troubling for Nimba and the country at large, because according to him, Liberia had been certified as a polio-free country.Earlier this month [October 2016], Front Page Africa reported that Liberia experienced its last case of the polio virus in 2010 in Grand Bassa.The disease, which has no cure, is caused by a highly infectious virus which is spread mainly through fecal matter or bodily fluids such as cough.The recent Ebola outbreak and the accompanying halt in vaccination campaigns raised concerns among health officials of the potential for resurgence of diseases, such as polio, that primarily affect children.In neighbouring Guinea, an outbreak erupted in 2015 that is in the last stages of being contained. That proximate outbreak makes Liberia a country at risk of an outbreak, according to the World Health Organization.Besides Guinea, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are the other countries with recent active cases of polio.[byline: Franklin Nehyalor]--communicated by:ProMED-EAFR from HealthMap Alerts<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>[This is a setback for Liberia, which had been previously certified polio free by WHO.The 2 years of the Ebola outbreak, which obviously disrupted the healthcare system including polio vaccination campaigns, might have allowed the reintroduction of polio into Liberia. Neighbouring Guinea, which also suffered in the Ebola outbreak, also recorded polio cases in 2015. Nigeria has 3 confirmed cases from this year [2016].Poliomyelitis is a highly infectious viral disease, which mainly affects young children. The virus is transmitted person-to-person mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and can cause paralysis.Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio; it can only be prevented by immunization (<http://www.cdc.gov/polio/>). - Mod.YAI have been unable to find additional media reports to confirm the above report, so one wonders whether the above suspected cases mentioned are AFP cases as yet pending laboratory confirmation or whether there have been preliminary findings of poliovirus (either wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived poliovirus). As mentioned by Mod.YA above, the disruption of health services during the prolonged ebolavirus outbreak may have led to pockets of susceptibles that reintroduced wild poliovirus (WPV) or a silently circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) may have infected, leading to paralytic polio in the area.Additional information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Liberia can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>. - Mod.MPP]
