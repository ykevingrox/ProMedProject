With over 17 000 EVD survivors in West Africa, the WHO has focused its strategy on managing survivors and the risk of re-emergence of outbreaks posed by persistence of the virus during convalescence. Sexual transmission from survivors has also been documented following the 2014 epidemic, and there are documented cases of survivors readmitted to hospital with ""recurrence"" of EVD symptoms. In addition to persistence of virus in survivors, there is also some evidence for ""reinfection"" with Ebola virus. In this paper, we reviewed the evidence for recurrence and reinfection of EVD and implications for epidemic control.Highlights1. Ebola virus may persist in various body fluids, resulting in reactivation illness.2. Reinfection with Ebola virus may be possible due to waning or lowered immunity or high viral challenge.3. With over 17 000 survivors in West Africa, precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of new cases and outbreaks.4. Surveillance systems in high-risk countries should be capable of rapid detection and control of new outbreaks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Risk of new infections occurring is high as a result of possible persistence of virus in recovered individuals, making education and surveillance critically important to achieve control. Furthermore, research is needed to identify non-human animal reservoirs. - Mod.LK]******[2] Vaccine, treatment, monitoring30 Dec 2015 Guinea: Ebola, the Executive Summary - 30 Dec 2015 [Ebola Deeply]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201512310726.html>[On Tue 29 Dec 2015, the World Health Organization declared Guinea as being free from Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission, and it has been a long time coming because of the tenacious grip EVD has had on the country. According to Fode Tass Sylla, a spokesperson for the country's Ebola task force, ""This is a very big victory for the nation and the people of Guinea.""As Guinea begins a 90-day period of close observation, the country is now able to accelerate the process of strengthening its health system.According to Dr. Dan Kelly, who has treated patients in Sierra Leone, ""We know Ebola is endemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, given that there's an animal reservoir of unknown origin in the region. It will always lie dormant in the areas of the world where previous outbreaks have occurred, and unless we drive the animal into extinction, we will never eradicate the disease.""]26 Dec 2015 Liberia: Ebola survivors research enrollment hits over 900<http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-ebola-survivors-research-enrollment-hits-over-900.html>[The Ebola Natural History Study, otherwise known as the Partnership for Research on the Ebola Virus Disease in Liberia (PREVAIL), has to date enrolled over 900 Ebola survivors into the Medical Study.

Although disparities between affected countries have been appreciated, disparities within West African countries have not been investigated as drivers of Ebola transmission. To quantify the role that poverty plays in the transmission of Ebola, we analyzed heterogeneity of Ebola incidence and transmission factors among over 300 communities, categorized by socioeconomic status (SES), within Montserrado County, Liberia......Individuals from areas of poverty were associated with high rates of transmission and spread of Ebola to other regions. Thus, Ebola could most effectively be prevented or contained if disease interventions were targeted to areas of extreme poverty and funding was dedicated to development projects that meet basic needs.]24 Dec 2015: Russia officially registering Ebola vaccine<http://sputniknews.com/russia/20151224/1032238945/ebola-africa-vaccine-russia.html>[According to the head of Russia's consumer rights watchdog, on 24 Dec 2015 the documents for registering the Russian vaccine against Ebola virus disease (EVD) were officially registered.
