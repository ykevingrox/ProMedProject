In this same period, there was another fatality reported in a case from Taif. With the exception of 2 cases in household contacts (one in Huraymla reported on 23 Aug 2016 and one in Jeddah reported on 7 Jul 2016) and a single case in a healthcare worker (Jubail, reported on 2 Aug 2016), all cases reported since 1 Jul 2016 (22 cases total) have been classified as primary cases (4 with no documented contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, 6 with indirect contact with camels, 5 with direct contact with camels, and 4 with camel exposure still under investigation).The Hajj has begun with a major influx of pilgrims into Saudi Arabia. Given the health infrastructure of the Hajj, and the clearly specified routes, and banning of camels from the Hajj area, there is room for optimism that there will not be MERS transmission related to the Hajj pilgrimage, similar to prior years.A recent media report from Saudi Arabia states: ""The Ministry of Health has prevented buses carrying pilgrims from stopping at camel enclosures along the roads because of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A number of pilgrims usually ask bus drivers to stop to take memorial photographs with the camels, which have been tainted to be the main carriers of coronavirus."" (<http://saudigazette.com.sa/saudi-arabia/tent-city-ready-welcome-guests-allah/>).There is more room for concern regarding pilgrims making the Umrah pilgrimage, which is often accompanied by sightseeing around the country, visiting areas with camel farms in proximity (and perhaps inadvertent indirect contact with camels) or actually visiting camel farms to sample raw camel milk close to the source.Maps showing the locations of the newly confirmed case and fatality can be found at the source URLs.
