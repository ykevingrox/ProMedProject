WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/19-december-2016-1-ah7n9-china/en/>On 12 Dec 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 6 additional cases of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.Onset date of symptoms ranged from 6 to 20 Nov 2016. Cases ranged in age from 32 to 80 years with a median age of 61 years, and all cases are male. All cases were hospitalized and reported to be in a severe condition.A total of 5 cases reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets, and 1 case has no clear history of exposure to live poultry. Cases were reported from 3 provinces; Jiangsu (4), Fujian (1) and Guangdong (1). No clusters of cases were reported.To date, a total of 806 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.Public health response----------------------The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:- Strengthened surveillance and assessment analysis.- Further enhanced medical care of the cases.- Conducted public risk communication.WHO risk assessment-------------------Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, further community level spread is considered unlikely.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as the virus may have a serious public health impact.WHO advice----------WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] New case in ShanghaiDate: 22 Dec 2016Source: Channel News Asia[edited]<http://www.channelnewsasia. com/news/asiapacific/shanghai- says-treating-man-diagnosed- with-bird-flu/3386346.html>Shanghai's health authority has confirmed it is treating a man diagnosed with H7N9 bird flu, the third case of human infection in China this week.The man travelled from the neighbouring province of Jiangsu, the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning said on its website on Wednesday. Shanghai is China's largest city by population with more than 24 million residents.Bird flu is most likely to strike in winter and spring and farmers have in recent years increased cleaning regimes, animal detention techniques, and built roofs to cover hen pens, among other steps, to prevent the disease.[Byline: Josephine Mason; Editing by Joseph Radford]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Human cases of influenza A/H7N9 continue to be reported sporadically from China and adjoining regions. Most cases have a documented history of exposure to poultry. As there are few or no signs of apparent infection in poultry, it is difficult to provide concrete advice to individuals handling poultry and therefore surveillance activities need to be continued. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
