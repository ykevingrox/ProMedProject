The children, most of them under 2 years of age, were from Arges, Bucharest and Dolj districts and were all admitted to the Children's Emergency Hospital 'M.S. Curie', in Bucharest. All had initially presented with diarrhea, some with bloody diarrhea, with onset from 25 Jan 2016 to 9 Feb 2016. The NIPH and the Romanian Ministry of Health formed an outbreak investigation team (OIT). On 18 Feb 2016, experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) joined the OIT. On 20 and 26 Feb 2016, 3 additional cases were reported, 1 from Bacau and 2 from Arges district. This communication describes the epidemiological and microbiological investigations as at 29 Feb 2016.Outbreak investigation----------------------In Romania, 4 regional hospitals (in Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi and Timisoara) are referral centres for management of HUS cases. To establish the baseline on number of HUS cases in Romania and to confirm the outbreak, we collected data on HUS admissions to these 4 hospitals between 2010 and 2015 in childrenÛäunder 5 years of age. We performed a descriptive time-series analysis by plotting the monthly number of HUS cases by date of diagnosis from 2010 to 2016, a 12-month moving average, and minimum, maximum and mean values observed by month between 2010 and 2015. We compared the number of diagnoses in January and February 2016 to the maximum monthly number of HUS diagnoses between 2010 and 2015.We collected microbiological results of tests performed at district hospitals on stool samples from HUS cases diagnosed in January and February 2016. The National Reference Laboratory (NRL) from Cantacuzino Institute in Bucharest tested for stx (stx1 and stx2) and eae genes by PCR. Isolates were tested with O antisera against the main STEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ -- EHEC - Mod.LL] serogroups by slide agglutination. Serum samples from 12 cases were sent to the Istituto Superiore di SanitÌÊ (ISS) in Rome, Italy to be tested for antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of 6 major EHEC serogroups (O157, O26, O103, O111, O145, and O55) by ELISA [1].For the purpose of this outbreak investigation, we formulated a case definition based on EHEC laboratory confirmation, HUS diagnostic [2] and date of onset. A confirmed outbreak case was defined as any individual with onset of diarrhea after 15 Jan 2016 in Romania and laboratory confirmation for EHEC O26. A probable outbreak case was defined as any individual with onset of diarrhea after 15 Jan 2016 in Romania, with clinical HUS but without laboratory confirmation for STEC O26 infection. Cases who traveled outside Romania within 2 weeks before symptom onset were excluded from the present investigation.For active case-finding, a national HUS and severe diarrhea surveillance system was set up on 15 Feb 2016. In addition, stool samples from 15 family members, all asymptomatic, of 4 confirmed and 2 probable cases were tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter and _E. coli_ (enteropathogenic, enterohemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic and enteroinvasive _E. coli_).To generate a hypothesis on the cause of the outbreak, between 24 and 28 Feb 2016, parents or guardians of the cases were interviewed with a questionnaire that comprised questions on food and water exposures and activities during the 10 days before the symptom onset. The questionnaire also comprised questions regarding episodes of diarrhea among family members.Findings--------Between 2010 and 2015, 101 HUS cases were diagnosed in Romania, with an average number of 16 cases per year, a minimum of 5 cases in 2010 and a maximum of 25 cases in 2015. The descriptive time-series analysis showed neither trend nor seasonality in the incidence of HUS from 2010 to 2016 (Figure 1a [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). As at 29 Feb 2016, 15 HUS cases were diagnosed in 2016: 2 in January and 13 in February. The number of cases diagnosed in February represented a 2.5-fold increase compared with the monthly maximum of 5 HUS diagnoses observed during the 6 previous years (Figure 1b).Among the 15 cases identified in 2016, 6 were confirmed and 9 were probable. They were aged between 5 and 38 months with a median age of 11 months. All but 1 wereÛäunderÛä2 years of age. 9 children were female. 3 cases died during this outbreak on 4, 15 and 16 Feb 2016 respectively. 12 cases (3 confirmed, 9 probable) resided in Arges district. The remaining 3 confirmed cases resided in Bucharest, Bacau and Dolj districts (Figure 2). The child from Bucharest spent the 5 days before onset in Bran (Brasov district, north-west of Arges) and this was considered the likely place of infection. The date of onset of diarrhea ranged from 25 Jan to 22 Feb (Figure 3).Stool samples from 3 cases tested positive for enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC) by agglutination using a polyvalent antisera at one district hospital laboratory. Because of poor quality, these specimens were not confirmed at the NRL.Serum samples from 12 cases were sent to the ISS to be tested for _E. coli_ O26 LPS antibodies. 6 sera were positive: 3 cases were from Arges, the most affected district, and the remaining 3 cases were from Bucharest, Bacau and Dolj districts. 1 of these also tested positive for _E. coli_ O157 LPS antibodies. NRL isolated _E. coli_ from 1 of the serologically confirmed case and identified the stx2 toxin and the eae genes. Furthermore, 2 additional stool samples from cases in Arges were tested for stx1 and 2 and eae, and both were positive; serogroup results are still pending. All the stool samples from family members tested negative.We interviewed parents or guardians of 5 confirmed and 3 probable cases and none of them mentioned episodes of diarrhea among family members within the 10 days before the disease onset of the child.The food section of the interview showed that during the 10 days before their symptoms onset, the cases consumed: fresh fruits (apples (8/8), pears (6/8), oranges (7/8), bananas (7/8)), vegetables (roots (8/8), pepper (8/8), zucchini (7/8)), meat (chicken (7/8), beef (4/8)), cow milk (4/8, unpasteurized for 1 of them), cow soft cheese (7/8; homemade for 4 of them) and yoghurt (6/8). All the other food items were consumed by less than 4 cases.Fruits and vegetables were bought either from small local food producers or supermarkets with larger distribution, meat was supplied by family's own production or bought from supermarkets and dairy products were bought from several shops and were sometimes homemade. 2 food chains were mentioned by parents/guardians during the interviews: 1 that distributed food only in Arges district (mentioned in relation to the consumption of soft cheese and yoghurt); and a 2nd one that distributed food in the whole country, mentioned in relation to the consumption of oranges.No other common exposure related to living conditions and outdoor activities could be identified.Discussion----------We describe a HUS outbreak with 15 cases, all among young children, of whom 3 died. The last case was reported on 26 Feb 2016 and had onset of symptoms 4 days before. Sera from 6 cases were positive for _E. coli_ O26 antibodies, among which one was confirmed by slide agglutination from culture.Since HUS usually occurs as a complication of EHEC infection [3] in a small proportion of patients, we cannot exclude that further milder cases of EHEC infection may have occurred in association with this outbreak even though no possible cases were identified in the investigation. Active case finding of HUS and severe diarrhea is ongoing nationwide in Romania. As at 16 Mar 2016, 3 additional confirmed and one probable case have been reported. These cases are from 2 districts previously not affected: Ialomita (2 confirmed and 1 probable case) and Sibiu (1 confirmed case) and had onset between 3 Feb 2016 and 4 Mar 2016.We hypothesise that this is a continuous common source food-borne outbreak, where most cases were infected by the same source over a 4-week period. Different fresh food items may have been contaminated by the same source early in the food production chain and then distributed on the market over a prolonged period of more than a month.Our study has several limitations. One is that we interviewed parents/guardians under a high emotional stress because this outbreak affected very young children and this may have led to lack of completeness of the clinical history. Moreover, due to incomplete characterization of the strains, we may have included cases unrelated to this outbreak. Finally, for a number of cases infection may have occurred through person-to-person transmission from a close contact, without being exposed to a contaminated food item.Large EHEC outbreaks, often associated with HUS cases, have been reported in several countries in the last decades [4-10]. Since 2010, the number of cases reported annually in The European Surveillance System (TESSy) [11] has steadily increased. The most frequent serotype is O157 and STEC O26 is the 2nd most commonly reported serotype in the European Union (EU) (greater than 400 cases per year in TESSy). EHEC O26 cases are generally younger than O157 cases, have more severe diarrhea, with more aggressive forms and higher proportion of the infected individuals develop HUS or other severe outcomes [12]. Outbreaks caused by EHEC O26 have been associated in the past with unpasteurized milk and dairy products in Austria, Belgium and Italy [13-15].A number of investigations are still ongoing in Romania to control this outbreak: environmental i.e. sampling food products in shops and from food producers, reviewing food production procedures of foods highlighted during the interviews; epidemiological i.e. collecting information through interviews with parents and or guardians of confirmed and probable cases but too few cases are currently available for an analytical study; active case finding i.e. surveillance for HUS in children (with reminders to front-line healthcare workers) and testing suspected cases for pathogenic _E. coli_; microbiological i.e. PFGE and whole genome sequencing to confirm outbreak cases and compare with isolates from foods (when available), and with previously reported O26 strains in TESSy.On 4 Mar 2016, during an environmental investigation undertaken following the information collected from the exploratory questionnaires, different cheese samples from a milk processing establishment in Arges district tested positive for stx genes. Isolates of _E. coli_ O26 were identified in a soft cheese from the same establishment. On 5 Mar 2016, this establishment voluntarily stopped production and closed the factory; the batches of suspected products were withdrawn from the Romanian market. The Romanian Food Safety Authority started an investigation tracing the distribution of the products from this milk processing establishment. On 7 Mar 2016 a Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) news (reference 16-811) was issued by the Romanian health authorities indicating that in 2016 products from this establishment were sold in other EU countries as well: Belgium, Germany, Italy and Spain. Furthermore, individual importations of products from the implicated establishment to other countries by individuals returning from Romania cannot be excluded.This is a stark reminder that EHEC can cause infections with severe complications, particularly among young children. Detection of outbreaks in the absence of sensitive and timely surveillance systems can be challenging, particularly if local laboratory capacities are not optimal. Improving local laboratories diagnostic capacities and performing unspecific HUS surveillance in children should be considered as a public health priority to avoid this from happening again. It is not yet clear when this outbreak started, and neither the vehicles nor the source of contamination were identified. However, after initial suspicion, the investigations confirmed the outbreak and its causative agent. This is an example of good collaboration between EU countries in terms of provision of laboratory services support and expert advice, and ECDC, in providing expert deployment and support.References----------1.

It would be interesting to know how many of the children had received antimicrobials early in the illness, which is a clear risk factor for the development of HUS. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>.]
