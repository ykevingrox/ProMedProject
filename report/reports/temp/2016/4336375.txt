EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]According to the OttawaSun.com news, the nature of the outbreak was a severe gastrointestinal illness (with vomiting and diarrhea) that affected 20 campers and 10 staff members as of 3 days ago [6 Jul 2016]. It was reported that the symptoms resemble those of the norovirus infection and that such an outbreak is the 1st of its kind in the region for this year [2016]. There was no mention of flu-like symptoms or any respiratory symptoms in this report (see link: <http://www.ottawasun.com/2016/07/06/uncommon-illness-causes-kids-camp-to-close>) [This news report is reproduced below].However, 24News.ca reported an outbreak of flu-like symptoms, similar to the report by CTV News (see link: <http://www.24news.ca/the-news/canada-news/234434-several-hospitalized-at-camp-for-disadvantaged-children-after-outbreak>) [This news report is identical to the news report previously posted by ProMED-mail and will not be reproduced below].I have not been able to clarify the nature of the outbreak. I will send any meaningful update that I may receive on this outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 6 Jul 2016Source: Ottawa Sun [edited]<http://www.ottawasun.com/2016/07/06/uncommon-illness-causes-kids-camp-to-close>About 125 children at a summer camp near Perth were sent home Wednesday [6 Jul 2016] after 20 campers and 10 staff members were stricken with a severe gastrointestinal illness.""It's just really unfortunate that we've had to arrive at this decision, but it's in the best interest of everybody,"" said Jeff Burry, executive director at Christie Lake Kids summer camp.The campers and staff began feeling the symptoms on Tuesday night [5 Jul 2016], Burry said. The Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit was called in to assess the situation Wednesday morning. ""With consultation from the public health authority, the decision was made to shut down the entire camp session,"" Burry said. ""We decided to err on the side of health and safety, and we thought we didn't want to exacerbate the situation for healthy campers.""Dr. Paula Stewart, the district's medical officer of health, commended the camp for its decision. ""With vomiting and diarrhea, it is so easily spread -- as you can imagine -- among campers, and we wanted to prevent any more children from becoming ill,"" she said. As well, closing the camp is necessary in order to do a thorough cleaning, she said.No cause has yet been confirmed; however, the symptoms closely resemble those brought on by norovirus, an acute gastroenteritis, Dr. Stewart said. Such an outbreak is the 1st of its kind in the region for this year [2016] and is usually uncommon, she added. ""The most important thing is that the children who are vomiting and have diarrhea are treated well and cared for no matter what the cause is,"" she said.The campers sent home on Wednesday [6 Jul 2016] were part of the 1st of the season's 3 10-day sessions that began on Sunday [3 Jul 2016]. The camp, one of the oldest in Ontario, aims to give economically disadvantaged children a chance to develop skills in a natural environment. Burry said that for now, it's too early to say how the camp will make it up to the children sent home but that discussions among staff will take place later in the summer to figure something out.Meanwhile, the 2nd session is set to begin as scheduled on 18 July 2016, he said.While the incident is a 1st for Christie Lake Kids, Burry said that children from other camps in the area fell ill with similar symptoms a few years ago.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We thank the anonymous EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for their rapid and very helpful reply to the request for information.The outbreak, from what we now know, was a severe gastrointestinal illness that attacked 20 campers and 10 staff members out of 125 campers and an unknown number of staffers (16% attack rate among campers) over a 24-hour period on the 3rd day of camp. The epidemic curve suggests an illness with a short incubation period and a common point source, which are consistent with a food-borne outbreak due to a norovirus.Norovirus is a leading cause of food-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks. The illness is self-limited and is characterized by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps for usually 1-3 days. Outbreaks of norovirus infection have high attack rates and secondary transmission rates. This may be due to the low infectious dose and the fact that infected individuals excrete virus in their stool before they feel sick and for up to 2 weeks or more after feeling well. The incubation period is short, from 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus (<http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/symptoms.html>).The source can be any food served raw, such as oysters, fruits, and vegetables, that are contaminated at their source or food contaminated by the hands of an infected food worker just before serving. Norovirus can spread quickly in closed settings, such as a summer camp, nursing homes, daycare centers, schools, and cruise ships. It was wise to disperse campers and staff before more became ill. In addition, noroviruses can also spread through touching contaminated surfaces, and noroviruses have a prolonged duration of survival on indoor surfaces, which likely plays a role on prolongation of outbreaks (<http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/502497?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents>).Contaminated surfaces will need cleaning with a bleach-based household cleaner; other types of disinfectants may not be effective at killing this virus (<http://epi.publichealth.nc.gov/cd/norovirus/home.html>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>.]
