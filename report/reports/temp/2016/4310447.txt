Saudi MOH [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-06-26-001.aspx>As of 13:00 [1 PM] today [26 Jun 2016], there have been a total of:1423 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including596 deaths [reported case fatality rate 42.0 percent]791 recoveries, and36 currently active cases [including 22 asymptomatic infections].In the past 24 hours there have been:2 newly confirmed cases (1 asymptomatic),0 newly reported fatalities, and0 newly reported recoveries.Information on newly reported cases:1- A 28-year-old Saudi male from Najran, healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Classified as a secondary case in a household contact.1- A 62-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh, non-healthcare worker, currently asymptomatic. Classified as a secondary case in a household contact.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In today's [26 Jun 2016] update, there are 2 newly reported cases in household contacts of previously confirmed cases, one in a healthcare worker in Najran, the other in Riyadh. Since 1 Jun 2016, there have been 3 cases of MERS-CoV confirmed in Najran, the 1st an 82-year-old male reported on 18 Jun 2016, classified as a primary case with no known history of contact with camels and reported as a fatality on 23 Jun 2016; the 2nd was in a 44-year-old male reported on 19 Jun 2016, also classified as a primary case but with high risk exposure to camels still under investigation, and this current case, a 28-year-old male healthcare worker, but classified as a secondary case in a household contact.As for the newly confirmed case in Riyadh, the individual is reported to be an asymptomatic secondary case in a household contact. A question that comes to mind is whether the household contact case of this newly reported case was a previously reported symptomatic case or perhaps an asymptomatic case on home isolation? There have now been 22 asymptomatic infections with MERS-CoV infection in this ongoing ""outbreak"" in the King Khaled University Hospital in Riyadh, and 6 symptomatic infections. To the best of my knowledge and memory, this is the largest ""outbreak"" of asymptomatic infections with MERS-CoV in contacts of confirmed cases reported to date. Questions that come to mind include whether the virus has changed and/or whether the laboratory testing protocol has changed. One wonders about the frequency of testing of contacts; are contacts tested regularly throughout the 14-day incubation period to identify all potential infections? If anyone has answers to these questions, it would be greatly appreciated if they could be shared with ProMED-mail.The locations of the newly confirmed cases can be found on a map at the source URL.
