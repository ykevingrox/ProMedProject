Zika virus continues to spread geographically to areas where competent vectors are present. Although a decline in cases of Zika infection has been reported in some countries, or in some parts of countries, vigilance needs to remain high.Situation- 75 countries and territories (Fig. 1, Table 1) have reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2007 (69 with reports from 2015 onwards), of which:58 with a reported outbreak from 2015 onwards (Fig. 2, Table 1);7 with having possible endemic transmission or evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in 2016;10 with evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in or before 2015, but without documentation of cases in 2016, or with the outbreak terminated.- âÊ12 countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus (Table 2).- âÊ28 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other CNS malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection, or suggestive of congenital infection (Table 3).- âÊ20 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of GBS and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases (Table 4).- âÊThe 1st Zika case in Myanmar reported on 4 Nov [2016] was confirmed by the Ministry of Health and Sport (MoHS). According to the final case report, there have been no additional cases of Zika detected in the last month despite a community-wide search for Zika cases. The MoHS concluded that this case was not due to local mosquito-borne transmission but possibly through person-to-person transmission. The husband of the case had recent travel history to multiple countries that have reported evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in 2016.[Tables, maps, and graphs are available at the above URL]Table 1.

Many banks are doing so already, and the early results indicate that the country has dodged a bullet -- for now.Screenings in a dozen states suggest that Zika infection remains exceedingly rare. Among the approximately 800 000 blood donations tested in the past 6 months or so, about 40 were initially positive for the virus.""It is good news that we are avoiding the transmission of Zika,"" said Dr Susan Rossmann, the chief medical officer at Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center in Houston.Still, she noted, it may not be surprising there are so few possibly positive cases, because blood banks have been dissuading people from donating if they recently traveled to an area in which the virus is circulating.Blood donation screening for Zika is performed with tests made by Roche Molecular Systems or by a collaboration between 2 medical companies, Hologic Inc. and Grifols.The screening effort is regulated as 2 gigantic clinical trials in which every blood donor is enrolled as a participant. All the results, therefore, are reported to the companies.By [Fri 11 Nov 2016], Roche's machines had screened 475 000 donations in the United States, excluding Puerto Rico. Just 25 have been ""initially reactive"" for Zika infection, said Tony Hardiman, who leads the company's blood screening program.""Compared to Puerto Rico, it's tiny,"" he said. Roughly 1 percent of the blood donors in Puerto Rico were infected by July [2016], with 1.8 percent of them testing initially positive in the last week of surveillance, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.By mid-October [2016], roughly 348 000 donations had been screened using the test made by Hologic Inc. and Grifols and 14 were initially positive for the Zika virus.It may be that not all of these samples are truly contaminated. The technology is still in development, and the manufacturers are scrambling to confirm their results with further investigations of the donors.Of 3 donors examined by Hologic and Grifols, all seem to have been infected outside the United States. One donor gave blood at United Blood Services in Reno, Nevada, after visiting Nicaragua. Another, a New Yorker, had been to Trinidad. The 3rd lives in Arizona and had visited Mexico.All 3 donors had minute traces of the Zika virus in their blood, detected between 41 and 97 days after travel abroad, Jeffrey Linnen, an associate vice president at Hologic, told attendees at a recent conference for AABB [formerly known as American Association of Blood Banks], the standards-setting group for most blood banks nationwide.Viral material detected after 40 days is unlikely to be live virus, said Dr David O Freedman, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""The farther along you are after infection, the more likely you are just detecting residual breakdown products from dead virus pieces that are still circulating,"" he said.In August [2016], the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] required all blood banks to screen each of the millions of blood donations collected annually for Zika; 11 states in high-risk areas had to put in the new safeguards in a month. The rest must do so by [Fri 18 Nov 2016].At the time, experts feared that Zika-infected mosquitoes would begin turning up in states along the Gulf Coast, prompting outbreaks like those seen in South America and threatening the nation's supply of donated blood.Universal screening was necessary to avoid transmission of the Zika virus in donated blood, particularly to pregnant women. If exposed to the virus in utero, fetuses can have brain damage, visual and joint problems, and muscle tone so rigid it restricts movement.Florida is the only state with documented local transmission of the virus. In July [2016], the FDA. temporarily halted collection of blood donations in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties until screening for the Zika virus could be put in place.Blood banks perform the screenings themselves or, more often, pay a laboratory to insure donations are Zika-[virus] free. The additional costs are passed on to hospitals.The range is from USD 6-10 a unit, Dr Rossmann said. ""It's not inconsiderable, that's for sure."" One 2011 survey found that hospitals paid USD 210 on average for a unit of red blood cells, after screening for pathogens. The cost of blood is increasing, the researchers also concluded.""The FDA requirement made it pretty clear that we don't have much of a choice, and the hospitals don't have much of a choice,"" Dr Rossmann said.Meeting the deadlines has been a monumental task for blood banks. Introducing a new test to screen donations usually takes 6-12 months.The FDA's timeline was just one month for blood banks in Florida and 11 other states thought to be at high risk for Zika outbreaks, and 3 months for those in 38 other states.""It was extremely painful, extremely expensive,"" said Phillip Williamson, the vice president for operations and scientific affairs at Creative Testing Solutions. ""This was an unfunded mandate from our government.""Rhode Island Blood Center, for example, acquired 2 new machines to screen 153 000 annual donations and trained 17 employees to load blood samples and run the automated testing around the clock. ""We've been scrambling to get ready,"" said Dr Carolyn Young, the chief medical officer.In the coming months, the main threat to the blood supply will be the roughly 4000 travelers infected with the Zika virus while abroad. Most do not have symptoms.Dr Lyle Petersen, the director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the CDC., has called the number of travel cases in the continental states ""extraordinary.""The fear is not that they will all seek to donate blood, but that they will serve as vectors by which the Zika virus will spread in the population, even when the mosquitoes that carry the infection are not present. Sexual transmission is the likeliest route. ""When people come back from trips, they generally have sex pretty soon,"" Dr Petersen recently told a packed room at an annual conference for blood transfusion experts. In all cases the CDC has studied, he said, ""transmission from infected travelers to their non traveler partners has occurred within 20 days of the 1st sexual contact.""Recently infected travelers have higher levels of Zika in their blood, semen and other bodily fluids, and are probably more infectious. Blood banks had been asking donors about their travel history and that of their sexual partners, and then asking them to postpone donating for at least a month.To prove that their new tests work reliably enough to be licensed, Hologic, Grifols, and Roche may need to enroll millions of participants in their continuing trials.Roughly 7 million people give blood annually; Creative Testing Solutions screens about a 3rd of them. ""We have to signup every one of those people for a clinical trial,"" Dr Williamson said.While the nonprofit can handle the burden, he added, ""I'm sure a lot of places out there are struggling as the result of the aggressive implementation guidelines mandated by FDA.""Still, most experts agree that universal screening is costly but necessary if the country wishes to avoid even a single instance in which a child is brain-damaged because of a transfusion of contaminated blood.The Community Blood Bank of Northwest Pennsylvania and Western New York, based in Erie, Pennsylvania, has been drawing extra tubes of blood from donors to fly overnight to a Houston laboratory for Zika screening at USD 6-10 a sample.""Compared to the overall cost of health care,"" said Scott Greenwell, the executive director of the blood bank, ""this is spit in the ocean.""[Byline: Catherine Saint Louis]--Communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>******[4] Virus cell tropism inhibitedDate: Tue 29 Nov 2016 [accessed]Source: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA (PNAS) [on line ahead of print, edited]<http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/28/1618029113.full>ref: Retallack H, Di Lullo E, Arias C: et al: Zika virus cell tropism in the developing human brain and inhibition by azithromycin. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2016; pii: 201618029. [Epub ahead of print]----------------------------------------------------------------------Significance------------Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has rapidly spread through the Americas and has been associated with fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly. To understand how microcephaly develops, it is important to identify which cell types of the developing brain are susceptible to infection. We use primary human tissue to show that radial glia and astrocytes are more susceptible to infection than neurons, a pattern that correlates with expression of a putative viral entry receptor, AXL. We also perform a screen of Food and Drug Administration-approved compounds, with an emphasis on drugs known to be safe in pregnancy. We identify an antibiotic, azithromycin, that reduces viral proliferation in glial cells, and compare its activity with daptomycin and sofosbuvir, 2 additional drugs with anti-ZIKV activity.Abstract--------The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with abnormal brain development constitute a global health emergency. Congenital ZIKV infection produces a range of mild to severe pathologies, including microcephaly. To understand the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection, we used models of the developing brain that faithfully recapitulate the tissue architecture in early to mid-gestation. We identify the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2177 compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy. We show that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced viral proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and human astrocytes. Our characterization of infection in the developing human brain clarifies the pathogenesis of congenital ZIKV infection and provides the basis for investigating possible therapeutic strategies to safely alleviate or prevent the most severe consequences of the epidemic.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The complete article is available at the source URL above.This study provides valuable insights into brain cells that Zika virus preferentially infects with mechanisms into production of teratogenic effects. The reduction of ZIKV replication by the antibiotic azithromycin is interesting, and may provide treatment to reduce those effects in pregnant women infected by the virus. One hopes that these findings will be tested in animal models soon.The challenge for the practical use of therapeutic agents to block or ameliorate fetal infection is one of early diagnosis. Since most ZIKV infections are mild to asymptomatic, many pregnant women are unaware that they have been infected. The timing of administration of the drug is also a challenge, since microcephaly is detected at 20 or more weeks of gestation when the damage has already begun. Additionally, a recent study has shown that some infants born with normal head size go on to suffer reduced brain development subsequently. Perhaps administration of the antibiotic or other drugs to interfere with ZIKV infection to all women of reproductive age residing in or visiting areas of active ZIKV transmission may provide a way around these challenges. - Mod.TY]******[5] Neonatal glaucomaDate: Wed 30 Nov 2016Source: Yale News [edited]<http://news.yale.edu/2016/11/30/zika-and-glaucoma-linked-first-time-new-study>A team of researchers in Brazil and at the Yale School of Public Health has published the 1st report demonstrating that the Zika virus can cause glaucoma in infants who were exposed to the virus during gestation.Exposure to the Zika virus during pregnancy causes birth defects of the central nervous system, including microcephaly. Brazilian and Yale School of Public Health researchers had reported early during the microcephaly epidemic that the virus also causes severe lesions in the retina, the posterior portion of the eye. However, until now, there has been no evidence that Zika causes glaucoma, a condition that can result in permanent damage to the optic nerve and blindness.""We identified the 1st case where Zika virus appears to have affected the development of the anterior chamber or front portion of the eye during gestation and caused glaucoma after birth,"" said Dr Albert Icksang Ko, professor at the Yale School of Public Health and co-author of the study published in the journal Ophthalmology. Ko has longstanding research collaborations in Brazil and has worked with local scientists since Zika first appeared in the Americas to better understand the birth defects that are caused by the virus and the risk factors for Zika congenital syndrome.While conducting their investigations of the microcephaly epidemic in Salvador in Northeast Brazil, the researchers identified a 3-month-old boy who was exposed to Zika virus during gestation. While no signs of glaucoma were present at the time of birth, the infant developed swelling, pain, and tearing in the right eye. The research team diagnosed glaucoma as the cause of symptoms and together with local ophthalmologists, performed a trabeculectomy, an operation that successfully alleviated the pressure within the eye.While this is the 1st known incidence of glaucoma in an infant with the Zika virus, clinicians treating patients with Zika should be aware that glaucoma is another serious symptom of the disease that should be monitored, said the investigators. Additional research is needed to determine if glaucoma in infants with Zika is caused by indirect or direct exposure to the virus, either during gestation or postpartum.The Zika virus, which is primarily transmitted through infected mosquitoes, has reached epidemic levels in several areas worldwide, and is of particular concern in Brazil, where the Pan American Health Organization reports more than 200 000 suspected cases and 109 000 confirmed cases of the disease. Since the outbreak began in 2015, Zika has now reached the United States, with more than 4000 travel-related cases reported, and 139 locally acquired mosquito-borne cases confirmed, according to the CDC.

Science 2016: 354(6316): 1148-52; DOI: 10.1126/science.aah3963----------------------------------------------------------------------Overview--------Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with fetal microcephaly and Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome. Other mosquito-born flaviviruses, such as dengue virus, encode noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) in their 3' untranslated region that accumulate during infection and cause pathology. Akiyama et al now report that ZIKV also produces sfRNAs that resist degradation by host exonucleases in infected cells. The authors solved the structure of one of ZIKV's sfRNAs by x-ray crystallography and found that the multi-pseudoknot structure that it adopts underlies its exonuclease resistance.Abstract--------The outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) and associated fetal microcephaly mandates efforts to understand the molecular processes of infection. Related flaviviruses produce noncoding subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) that are linked to pathogenicity in fetal mice. These viruses make sfRNAs by co-opting a cellular exonuclease via structured RNAs called xrRNAs. We found that ZIKV-infected monkey and human epithelial cells, mouse neurons, and mosquito cells produce sfRNAs. The RNA structure that is responsible for ZIKV sfRNA production forms a complex fold that is likely found in many pathogenic flaviviruses. Mutations that disrupt the structure affect exonuclease resistance in vitro and sfRNA formation during infection. The complete ZIKV xrRNA structure clarifies the mechanism of exonuclease resistance and identifies features that may modulate function in diverse flaviviruses.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These studies report a molecular mechanism, exonuclease resistance, that may contribute to Zika virus pathogenesis. - Mod.TY]
