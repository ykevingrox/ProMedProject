Chipata district commissioner Kalungu Zulu told journalists in Chipata that Kasungu has recorded 20 cases of cholera and 4 deaths since the disease broke out early this week [week of 1 Feb 2016]. Mr Zulu is concerned that cholera could spread to Chipata due to its proximity with Kasungu.""I am appealing to both traditional leaders and clergymen to sensitize people on how the disease can be prevented and for now, people should avoid public gatherings,"" Mr Zulu said. He said Malawian authorities confirmed the outbreak of cholera in Kasungu and that Chipata is on alert because the disease could reverse economic gains. He said the chances of the Malawian traders traveling to Chipata and their Zambians counterparts traveling to Kasungu are high and that it is important for residents to be forewarned.Mr Zulu appealed to Chipata residents not to buy foodstuff from street vendors and that fruits like mangoes, which are sold in streets of Chipata, are brought in from Malawi. He directed Chipata Municipal Council to intensify inspection of markets and restaurants to ensure they operate in good sanitary conditions.

Symptoms of intestinal infection include diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever. Necessary laboratory tests have confirmed this.Speaking to The Sangai Express, Health Director Dr O Ibomcha said that laboratory test of the samples collected from the patients have confirmed that the disease is _E. coli_ and not cholera.Stating that specialist doctors at Lilong PHC [Primary Health Centre] are closely monitoring the situation, Dr Ibomcha said that tests are also underway to see if there is any case of Arsenic poisoning. The result however will take some more time, he added.On the other hand, the Health Director has urged the people of Manipur not to proceed or visit countries in Latin America, Central America, and the Caribbean countries to protect themselves from Zika virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_E. coli_ can be isolated in large numbers from human stool. Such isolation does not imply that the organism is or is not the cause of diarrhea. More information is needed to say that the _E. coli_ is an enteropath related to a variety of mechanisms.The following is derived from Lutwick LI: Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting Emerging Zoonoses: The One Health Paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (eds) Springer, Tokyo, Japan, 2014, pp 77-112.""_E. coli_ is by far the most common facultative (can grow both aerobically or anaerobically) Gram-negative bacillus in the human intestinal tract. Within its niche in the intestinal tract, the organism is part of the normal bacterial flora with many functions to help its human host including preventing pathogen colonization, degrading dietary and in situ-produced compounds and producing nutrients. Although the pathogenicity of these normal flora strains of the organism occurs when the commensal is allowed to enter sterile parts of the body including the peritoneum, urinary tract and blood stream, some _E. coli_ strains have acquired virulence factors to become enteropathogenic for man. There are currently 6 enteropaths of the bacterium described (enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, diffuse adhering, enteroaggregative, and enterohemorrhagic). The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is the potentially the most dangerous and is the one which is zoonotic in origin (primarily from cattle) and the one generally just called _E. coli_ in the lay press."" - Mod.LLManipur State in northeastern India can be seen on the maps at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/311>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
