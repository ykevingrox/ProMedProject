Human _M. bovis_ and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ are clinically indistinguishable, but require unique regimens due to inherent treatment resistances.""Human _M. bovis_ disease is typically attributed to consumption of unpasteurized milk (or dairy products made from unpasteurized milk) in or imported from countries with affected cattle herds,"" the CDC researchers wrote. ""Person-to-person airborne transmission of _M. bovis_ has been reported infrequently, with uncertainty remaining about dietary exposures.""In April 2014, a Nebraskan man aged 42 years who emigrated from Mexico in 2010 sought care for persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and progressive debilitation. Nucleic acid amplification testing of sputum suggested pulmonary TB resulting from _M. bovis_. The man reported current employment on a dairy farm, as well as frequent consumption of raw milk.Two months later, a girl aged 16 years who was born in Nebraska also sought medical care for persistent cough, which was eventually diagnosed as _M. bovis_ TB. The patient reported no history of international travel and no memory of consuming Mexican dairy products.Cultures grown from the patients' sputum samples revealed the 2 isolates to be indistinguishable, with later whole-genome sequencing results suggesting that the 2 were closely related and shared a common ancestor with isolates collected from Mexican cattle. The only social connection identified between the patients was attendance at the same church, where their interactions were reported as minimal.Contact investigations of household, community, and work acquaintances found 24 persons with extended close exposure, 10 of whom were determined to have latent infection. Another latent infection was detected among 57 school contacts of the 2nd patient, while 28 of 100 persons exposed to either patient at the church also showed infection. 2 months after initial testing, follow-up examination of these contacts identified 6 more infections, resulting in an overall latent infection rate of 25%.Investigation of possible transmission events suggested that airborne transmission was likely in approximately 1/3 of the identified infections, the researchers wrote, but unrecognized consumption of imported dairy products carrying the pathogen should not be ruled out.""This report adds to the evidence for airborne person-to-person spread of _M. bovis_,"" the researchers wrote. ""Public health responses to _M. bovis_ pulmonary TB should be the same as those for _M. tuberculosis_ TB, with the additional inquiries about consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. The ongoing incidence of _M. bovis_ TB in human substantiates the need to control bovine tuberculosis globally and to pasteurize all milk and dairy products.""_M. bovis_ has gradually become a greater concern in other states such as California, where resulting TB cases appear to have increased, according to a retrospective review published last year [2015] in Emerging Infectious Diseases [2].Using data from the state's TB registry collected from 2003 to 2011, researchers identified culture-confirmed patients whose initial drug susceptibility results demonstrated resistances akin to _M. bovis_. Researchers reviewed the registry for sociodemographic, clinical and treatment outcome information for all patients, and conducted bivariate analysis of these patient characteristics.They found that the proportion of TB cases in California for all ages caused by _M. bovis_ increased from 3.4% of 2384 cases in 2003 to 5.4% of 1808 cases in 2011 (P = .002), an increase over the 1% to 2% of TB cases in the US reportedly attributable to _M. bovis_ infection. In multivariate analysis, the researchers determined independent associations between _M. bovis_ disease and Hispanic ethnicity, extrapulmonary disease, diabetes, and immunosuppressive conditions. Also of note, all 6 cases of _M. bovis_ disease in children during 2010 and 2011 had at least one parent or guardian who was born in Mexico, as opposed to 38% of child case-patients with disease attributable to_ M. tuberculosis_ (P = .005).""In California, there are ongoing interventions designed to limit the demand for and distribution of unpasteurized and contaminated dairy products, which are associated with _M. bovis_ disease and other foodborne diseases,"" the researchers wrote. ""Elimination of human _M. bovis_ disease in California likely requires further implementation of programs to reduce _M. bovis_ contamination.""[Byline: Dave Muoio][References-----------1.

In humans, consumption of unpasteurized milk products from infected animals is thought to be a common source of infection; however, human-to-human, airborne transmission from patients with _M. bovis_ pulmonary tuberculosis is also possible (Lobue PA, et al. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 2004; 8: 868-72), as was the case in the news report above.Accurate speciation of isolates from clinical specimens is important for epidemiologic and clinical reasons. However, very frequently, a clinical isolate is only identified as ""_M. tuberculosis_ complex,"" and pyrazinamide resistance is not routinely performed. In such circumstances, the standard 6-month, short-course combination drug therapy for TB, which includes pyrazinamide, is likely to fail, as the 6-month, short-course regimen depends on the rapid bactericidal action of pyrazinamide; without this drug as part of an effective initial regimen, therapy must be prolonged beyond 6 months.Human infection caused by _M. bovis_ has been mostly, but not completely, eradicated in the USA by the use of pasteurization of milk and culling of herds shown positive on tuberculin skin testing, starting in about 1917. _M. bovis_ human infection continues to be reported in the USA, primarily in immigrants from countries where bovine tuberculosis remains endemic and where many presumably acquired their infection.Bovine tuberculosis is endemic in Latin America, including Mexico (Milian F, et al. Rev Latinoam Microbiol. 2000; 42: 13-9). In the US, TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who acquire the infection in their countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An underappreciated pathogen. Curr Infect Dis Rep 2008, 10(6): 444-6 and Dankner WM, Davis CE: _Mycobacterium bovis_ as a significant cause of tuberculosis in children residing along the United States-Mexico border in the Baja California region. Pediatrics. 2000; 105(6): E79; abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835092>).People of Hispanic ethnicity and consumption of unpasteurized milk products produced in Latin America are not restricted to states of the USA bordering Mexico. An investigation in New York City identified 35 cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ during 2001-4; 19 of the 23 interviewed patients reported eating cheese produced in Mexico while they were living in the USA (<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/507311_print>). In this investigation, of the 35 isolates, 14 were resistant to streptomycin, one was resistant to INH [isoniazid], and 2 were resistant to INH and streptomycin, in addition to being resistant to pyrazinamide. Thus, accurate speciation of clinical isolates identified as ""_M. tuberculosis_ complex"" and drug susceptibility testing are important throughout the country. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229>.]
