EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]<promed@promedmail.org>[re: ProMED-mail. Tularemia - Germany: (RP) grape harvesters, RFI 20161122.4647007]-----------------------------------------------------------------The local health department of Mainz-Bingen [Rhineland-Palatinate] is investigating a cluster of 6 serologically confirmed cases of tularemia among 30 mostly volunteering participants of a grape harvest, which took place at the beginning of October 2016. 3 to 8 days after the activity, the affected individuals suffered from high fevers, general malaise, and unilateral marked cervical lymphadenopathy suggesting an oropharyngeal route of infection. 3 of the 6 patients were briefly hospitalized. Typical hints from patient history such as exposure to wild game and associated products were absent from the patients' history and thus diagnosis of tularemia was delayed. Currently, all patients are well and have either completed or are about to complete their course of antimicrobial therapy (ciprofloxacin or doxycycline). An epidemiological outbreak investigation is underway considering a broad range of environmental exposures and food-stuffs consumed during the event.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We thank the EpiCore contributor for this information and await further information about the cluster.Mainz-Bingen is a district (kreis) in the east of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
