She will be accused of intentionally concealing the fact that she had a fever during a medical screening on her way back to Scotland. She is also accused of failing to inform medical staff that she had taken paracetamol, known to treat pain and lower fevers.At the time Public Health England staff, which was in charge of screening for EVD at the airport, allowed her onto a connecting flight back to Scotland. The following day she became ill and was flown to an isolation unit in London. If the allegations against her are proved, ""PC"" could be struck off [fired] as a nurse. ...[She has been] a nurse for 16 years, volunteered to work at an Ebola Treatment Facility in Sierra Leone during the West Africa outbreak after responding to an NHS [National Health Service] appeal. In December 2014, she returned home to Scotland where she complained that she felt unwell and had a high temperature. She was diagnosed with EVD, was in critical condition, and treated at Royal Free Hospital in London where she spent almost a month in isolation.]Research------16 Aug 2016 Liberia: NIH explores connection between Ebola survival and co-infection with malaria parasites <http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-08/nioa-nec081616.php>[According to data collected at an Ebola diagnostic laboratory in Liberia in 2014-2015, people infected with Ebola virus were 20 percent more likely to survive if they were co-infected with malaria-causing _Plasmodium_ parasites. Moreover, greater numbers of _Plasmodium_ parasites correlated with increased rates of Ebola survival, according to a dozen collaborating research groups in the new study, published in Clinical Infectious Diseases.Citation.Rosenke K, Adjemian J, Munster V, et al.

(<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/20/cid.ciw452.full.pdf+html>).Abstract-Background. The ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa has resulted in 28 646 suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola virus infections. Nevertheless, malaria remains a large public health burden in the region affected by the outbreak. A joint Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institutes of Health diagnostic laboratory was established in Monrovia, Liberia, in August 2014, to provide laboratory diagnostics for Ebola virus. -Conclusions. Plasmodium species parasitemia is associated with an increase in the probability of surviving Ebola virus infection. More research is needed to understand the molecular mechanism underlying this remarkable phenomenon and translate it into treatment options for Ebola virus infection.]18 Aug 2016 Destabilized viruses involved in outbreaks<http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/18/070102> [Citation.Aris-Brosou S, Ibeh N, NoÌÇl J. ( 18 Aug 2016 EPub). Viral outbreaks involve destabilized viruses: evidence from Ebola, Influenza and Zika. BioRxiv.  doi: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/070102>Abstract.Although viral outbreaks and pandemics have plagued humans and other organisms for billions of years, such events are not only still impossible to predict, but the ultimate reasons why outbreaks happen are not understood. Based on recent viral outbreaks and pandemics (Ebola, Zika and Influenza), we searched for a common denominator to these events, positing that the genome of outbreak viruses is far from an evolutionary equilibrium, which is ultimately maintained by a dense network of correlated substitutions. We show here that genes of outbreak viruses are characterized by destabilized correlation networks, a result that might improve outbreak surveillance.]18 Aug 2016: Next Steps for Ebola Vaccination: Deployment in Non-Epidemic, High-Risk Settings.<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0004802>[Citation.

However, the magnitude of the most recent West African outbreak has led to the observation that many survivors will develop systemic and ophthalmic medical conditions following recovery from acute [Ebola virus disease] EVD. Yeh and colleagues included 96 EVD survivors in their study in which 26 eyes of 21 patients developed uveitis. The authors reported about 38 percent of EVD survivors with uveitis had visual acuity of 20/400 or worse, which is considered blind in accordance with World Health Organization criteria (Article written by Robert Linnehan).Reference.
