eNews Channel Africa (eNCA)[edited]<https://www.enca.com/south-africa/superbug-infects-10-newborns-in-kzn-da>The Democratic Alliance [DA] says it has been reliably informed that an outbreak of the multidrug resistant ""superbug"" _Klebsiella_ has hit Durban's [KwaZulu-Natal] Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital's neonatal ICU, with 10 babies infected in less than 2 weeks.It was uncertain whether there had been any deaths to date at the hospital in Phoenix, [Durban] KwaZulu-Natal MPL Dr Imran Keeka said on [Sun 1 May 2016]. ""In the ICU setting, the bacteria can cause life threatening or fatal septicaemia, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and other infections. This has led to the containment of the unit, with babies in need of urgent medical care being diverted to other facilities in the province in the interim,"" Keeka said.The DA was stunned by this revelation. Several years ago there was a _Klebsiella_ outbreak at the hospital, which led to the deaths of many babies. The information followed just weeks after the DA exposed an outbreak of the multidrug resistant bug _Acinetobacter_ at Durban's Inkosi Albert Luthuli hospital's NICU, which had already led to the deaths of 2 babies. It also followed last years' [2015] exposure of the deaths of 5 newborn babies at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli allegedly due to either _Acinetobacter_ and/or _Klebsiella_, he said.On each occasion the DA called on KwaZulu-Natal health MEC [Member of the Executive Council] Sibongiseni Dhlomo to order an immediate and comprehensive audit into infection controls at all provincial hospitals. ""To the best of our knowledge this has never taken place. This demonstrates a complete lack of empathy. The outbreak of such serious bacterial outbreaks should never happen in a hospital where infection controls are taken seriously. Equally alarming is that, as with the recent _Acinetobacter_ outbreak at Inkosi Albert Luthuli, KZN's health department has not informed the public about the circumstances at Mahatma Gandhi. Again, this is reminiscent of the previous regime that hid matters of important public interest to cover up their atrocities and injustice,"" Keeka said.The DA expected answers from Dhlomo. It wanted to know when the department would make a public announcement, why it had taken so long to get the outbreak under control, and why babies were still becoming infected 10 days after the 1st case was identified.The DA would communicate with the department as a matter of urgency. This outbreak could not be ""hidden from the public any longer."" Nor should any deaths as a result of _Klebsiella_ be attributed to other secondary illnesses, such as pneumonia, in an attempt to downplay the seriousness of the matter. ""Politicians of the governing party must commit to service delivery and the safety of all South Africans. They must stop caring only for their cronies and return to caring for everyone.""The DA expects the handlers of this department to embark on delivery, Ubuntu [humanitarian], and getting the very basic things right -- before embarking on their campaign for the 2016 local government elections with more empty promises,"" Keeka said.eNCA.com had contacted the KZN Department of Health for comment on the matter. No comment had been received at the time of publication.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of South Africa can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/south_africa_prov_map2.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6261>. Durban, located in eastern South Africa on the Indian Ocean coast, with a population of 3.5 million people, is the largest city in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal and after Johannesburg, ranks with Cape Town as among the most populous urban areas and is busiest port in South Africa (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban>).The news report above fails to tell us the species of _Klebsiella_ causing the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) outbreak, the antibiotics that the organism is resistant to, and what the resistance mechanisms are. Genotyping clinical isolates of the _Klebsiella_ will help establish if these cases have a common source. Also, matching genotypes of clinical isolates with possible environmental isolates would help confirm a source in the environment._Klebsiella_ is a type of Gram-negative bacillus. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _K. oxytoca_ are the 2 species of this genus responsible for most human infections. _K. oxytoca_ has been implicated in neonatal bacteremia, especially among premature infants and in NICU. _Klebsiella_ may colonize the skin, pharynx, or gastrointestinal tract. The principal pathogenic reservoirs of infection are the gastrointestinal tract of patients, the hands of hospital personnel, and the healthcare environment. Organisms can spread rapidly, often leading to outbreaks of nosocomial infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis.Factors that place patients at risk for _Klebsiella_ infection include prolonged hospitalization (especially in an intensive care unit), severe illness, including major surgery, compromised states (such as diabetes, alcoholism), antimicrobial therapy, prolonged use of invasive medical devices, and inadequate infection control practices._Klebsiella_ have developed multiple antimicrobial drug resistance, commonly due to production of beta-lactamases that destroy the class of beta-lactam antibiotics known as carbapenems, as well as all other beta-lactam antibiotics. These carbapenemases are referred to as KPCs, that is, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases. Some multidrug resistant strains have also been found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The genes that encode KPCs and ESBLs are plasmid-mediated, which readily facilitates horizontal gene transfer between bacteria. The genes that encode these beta-lactamases are often linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics.Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multidrug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. Management of multidrug resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee; 2007; available at <http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf>). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and patients (that is, segregating colonized or infected patients and the healthcare personnel who care for them from those without multidrug resistant _Klebsiella_ and the healthcare personnel who care for them) (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0305a1_w>). Additional important infection-control practices include antimicrobial stewardship and limited use of invasive devices. - Mod.ML]
