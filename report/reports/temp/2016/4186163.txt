Rapid and long-term immunity elicited by DNA encoded antibody prophylaxis and DNA vaccination against Chikungunya virus.BackgroundVaccination and passive antibody therapies are critical for controlling infectious diseases. Passive antibody administration has limitations including the necessity for purification and the delivery of multiple injections required for efficacy. Vaccination is associated with a lag phase before generation of immunity. Novel approaches reported here utilize the benefits of both methods for the rapid generation of effective immunity.MethodsAn antibody-based prophylaxis/therapy entailing the electroporation-mediated delivery of synthetic plasmids, encoding biologically active anti-Chikungunya virus envelope mAb (designated dMAb), was designed and evaluated for anti-viral efficacy as well as for the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination by a novel passive immune-based strategy.ResultsOne intramuscular injection of the CHIKV-dMAb produced antibodies in vivo more rapidly than active vaccination with a CHIKV-DNA vaccine. This dMAb neutralized diverse CHIKV clinical isolates and protected mice from viral challenge. Combinations of both afford rapid as well as long-lived protection.ConclusionsWe report that a DNA based dMAb strategy induces rapid protection against an emerging viral infection, which can be combined with DNA vaccination providing a uniquely both short term and long-term protection against this emerging infectious disease. These studies have implications for pathogen treatment and control strategies.--Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[The results of mouse protection look very promising. One hopes that they will provide as good protection in non-human primates and then in humans, and be scalable for industrial production and affordable in developing countries, where most cases of chikungunya virus infection occur. - Mod.TY]******[3] Kerala India - chikungunya NOTDate: Wed 13 Apr 2016Source: PLoS 1 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152787 [edited]<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0152787>Wills PJ, Anjana M, Nitin M, Varun R, Sachidanandan P, Jacob TM, Lilly M, Thampan RV, Karthikeya Varma K. Population Explosions of Tiger Moth Lead to Lepidopterism Mimicking Infectious Fever Outbreaks.AbstractLepidopterism is a disease caused by the urticating scales and toxic fluids of adult moths, butterflies or its caterpillars. The resulting cutaneous eruptions and systemic problems progress to clinical complications sometimes leading to death. High incidence of fever epidemics were associated with massive outbreaks of tiger moth _Asota caricae_ adult populations during monsoon in Kerala, India. A significant number of monsoon related fever characteristic to lepidopterism was erroneously treated as infectious fevers due to lookalike symptoms. To diagnose tiger moth lepidopterism, we conducted immunoblots for tiger moth specific IgE in fever patients' sera. We selected a cohort of patients (n = 155) with hallmark symptoms of infectious fevers but were tested negative to infectious fevers. In these cases, the total IgE was elevated and was detected positive (78.6 percent) for tiger moth specific IgE allergens. Chemical characterization of caterpillar and adult moth fluids was performed by HPLC and GC-MS analysis and structural identification of moth scales was performed by SEM analysis. The body fluids and chitinous scales were found to be highly toxic and inflammatory in nature. To replicate the disease in experimental model, Wistar rats were exposed to live tiger moths in a dose dependant manner and observed similar clinico-pathological complications reported during the fever epidemics. Further, to link larval abundance and fever epidemics we conducted cointegration test for the period 2009 to 2012 and physical presence of the tiger moths were found to be cointegrated with fever epidemics. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate that inhalation of aerosols containing tiger moth fluids, scales and hairs cause systemic reactions that can be fatal to human. All these evidences points to the possible involvement of tiger moth disease as a major cause to the massive and fatal fever epidemics observed in Kerala.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A 15 Apr 2015 report citing the above study, stated that suspected cases of chikungunya and dengue virus infections in Kerala are, in fact, that of 'Lepidopterism', a disease caused by Tiger Moths. <http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/suspected-chikungunya-cases-in-kerala-are-of-lepidoterism-116041500740_1.html>. This situation is yet another indication of the role of diagnostic laboratories to establish a reliable diagnosis especially of febrile diseases that have similar symptoms. - Mod.

Vol. 22 (7) DOI: 10.3201/eid2207.160116 [edited]<http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2207.160116>Simmons G, BrÌ¬s V, Lu K, et al. High incidence of chikungunya virus and frequency of viremic blood donations during epidemic, Puerto Rico, USA, 2014.AbstractChikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused large epidemics throughout the Caribbean in 2014. We conducted nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for CHIKV RNA (n = 29 695) and serologic testing for IgG against CHIKV (n = 1232) in archived blood donor samples collected during and after an epidemic in Puerto Rico in 2014. NAAT yields peaked in October with 2.1 percent of donations positive for CHIKV RNA. A total of 14 percent of NAAT-reactive donations posed a high risk for virus transmission by transfusion because of high virus RNA copy numbers (4-9 base 10 RNA copies/mL) and a lack of specific IgM and IgG responses. Testing of minipools of 16 donations would not have detected 62.5 percent of RNA-positive donations detectable by individual donor testing, including individual donations without IgM and IgG. Serosurveys before and after the epidemic demonstrated that nearly 25 percent of blood donors in Puerto Rico acquired CHIKV infections and seroconverted during the epidemic.--Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[This last report raises the serious dilemma of assuring that blood products are safe in the face of an extensive outbreak. Testing pools of 16 samples would not have detected 2/3 of the RNA positive donations tested individually. Testing all donations individually is very expensive. - Mod. TY]
