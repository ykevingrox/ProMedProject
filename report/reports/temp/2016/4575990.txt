GÌ nther, et al. (2016) report [1] on how their laboratory routine surveillance system detected an unexpected rise in AX bloodstream infections in a 2200-bed hospital. An epidemiological investigation was conducted to find the source and disrupt further transmission.Outbreak cases were defined as patients with at least one positive blood culture positive for AX from May 2014 to May 2015. Medical records were reviewed; affected wards, as well as the microbiology laboratory were audited. Additionally, microbiologic culture and biofilm staining for suspected antiseptic reusable tissue dispensers were performed, and isolated AX strains were typed using RAPD PCR and PFGE.During the outbreak period, AX were isolated from blood cultures from 26 patients. The retrospective cohort study did not reveal common risk factors. The clinical features of the case patients suggested a pseudobacteremia. The reusable tissue dispensers containing Incidin Plus solution product were found to be contaminated with biofilm-forming AX. Typing of the isolates revealed that blood culture isolates were identical with the strains found in the dispensers.After changing the usage of the product to single-use and educating staff, the outbreak was terminated. Contamination of dispensers occurred due to insufficient reprocessing, since biofilm disrupting steps were not included in the process.[1. GÌ nther F, Merle U, Frank U, Gaida MM and Mutters NT. Pseudobacteremia outbreak of biofilm-forming _Achromobacter xylosoxidans_ -- environmental transmission. BMC Infectious Diseases. 2016;16:584. Available at: <http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-1909-0>.][Byline: Cathy O'Leary]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report describes an outbreak of pseudobacteremia due to _Achromobacter xylosoxidans_ in 26 patients hospitalized at Heidelberg University Hospital (reference 1 above). _A. xylosoxidans_ is an aerobic, motile, Gram-negative bacillus found in aqueous environments. It can cause a variety of usually hospital-acquired infections and is associated with a high mortality. It has been increasingly isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis. _A. xylosoxidans_ are inherently resistant to aminoglycosides, but acquired resistance to multiple other antibiotics commonly occurs and complicates therapy. _A. xylosoxidans_ are even resistant to some disinfectant solutions, especially in the presence of biofilms.Pseudobacteremia is false-positive blood cultures that results from contamination of blood culture bottles or other instruments used to obtain blood samples; nevertheless pseudobacteremia may significantly influence patient care by unnecessarily exposing patients to the side effects of antibiotics and other interventions, and add considerably to the cost of medical care. Pseudobacteremia described in this hospital outbreak was caused by use of _A. xylosoxidans_-contaminated tissues to wipe off the blood culture bottles after removal of their lids, leading to the contamination of blood cultures. The tissues were obtained from _A. xylosoxidans_-contaminated, poorly maintained reusable dispensers. A picture of the tissue dispensers is available at the source URL (<http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-1909-0>). Contamination occurred despite the presence in the tissues and dispensers of an antiseptic Incidin Plus, a disinfectant containing glucoprotamin, a bactericidal and fungicidal agent used for disinfection of patient-related areas, i.e. nightstands and bedrails.In fact, _A. xylosoxidans_ was previously reported to have been isolated from reusable tissue dispensers containing surface disinfectants, including glucoprotamin, that were randomly collected from German healthcare facilities in a study published in 2014 [1]. However, the investigators do not name the healthcare facilities that were sampled.1. Kampf G, Degenhardt S, Lackner S, et al.
