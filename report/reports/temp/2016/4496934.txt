King5 [edited]<http://www.king5.com/news/local/fourth-patient-at-uw-medical-center-with-legionnaires-disease/319467036>A 4th patient at University of Washington [UW] Medical Center has been diagnosed with legionella [infection], also known as legionnaires' disease. UW Medicine and the King County Health Department say the patient was hospitalized in the Cascade Tower. That's the same place tests have shown the bacteria exists in an ice machine, a sink, and 3 pieces of operating room equipment which did not make contact with patients.The patient, a man in his 40s, had an underlying medical condition that made him more at risk for contracting the disease. He was there before new precautions were put in place to protect patients from the bacteria. He is in a satisfactory condition.Two of the 4 patients diagnosed with [legionellosis] have died, but it's not clear whether the cause of death for one of them was from the bacteria.UW says it will begin chemically treating the water in the Cascade Tower early next week until the legionella is eliminated.UW Medicine plans to contact specific high-risk patients who were hospitalized between 24 Aug and 13 Sep 2016 in the Cascade Tower to educate them about signs and symptoms of [legionnaires' disease]. UW has also activated a legionella information line: 855-520-2252.[byline: Travis Pittman]--communicated by:Denis Green <legion1@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for this submission.One additional case (the 4th) of legionnaires' disease and more environmental isolates of legionella (3 pieces of operating room equipment, in addition to the an ice machine and sinks) at the University of Washington in the Cascade Tower have been reported since the last post. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
