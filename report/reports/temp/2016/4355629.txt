AllAfrica, The Monitor report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201607190458.html>A disease suspected to be yellow fever [YF] has hit Bukomansimbi District leaving at least 5 people dead in the past week.According to residents, the disease causes bleeding through the nose, ears and private parts and a yellowish discharge from the mouth following hours of constant headache and high fever. The disease kills within 3-4 days.A blood sample was obtained from a 5-year-old female resident of Kamanda village, Kibinge Sub-county who had been admitted to Villa Maria Hospital where she eventually died. The Bukomansimbi District health officer, Dr Alfred Kato, confirmed the deaths in Butenga and Kibinge sub-counties saying: ""We have not yet confirmed the disease though we suspect it to be YF."" He added that they have since sent blood samples from parents and relatives of the deceased as well as their clothes to the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, to ascertain the disease.Dr Kato said after an outbreak of YF in Masaka District, all nearby districts started sensitizing the population and was optimistic that majority are aware of the scourge. Leaders in nearby districts of Sembabule and Kalungu have advised residents in the 2 districts to take precautionary measures and alert health workers in case similar signs manifest among them.[Byline: Christopher Kisekka]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Bukomansimbi district is adjacent to the Masaka district, where there were cases of sylvan yellow fever (YF) within the past 2 months, so it would not be surprising if the above cases were YF as well. ProMED will be very interested in knowing the results of the laboratory tests. If these cases are confirmed as YF, surveillance in the district should be intensified and a vaccination campaign needs to be initiated as soon as possible. One hopes that there is an adequate stock of vaccine available should a campaign need to be initiated. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>.]
