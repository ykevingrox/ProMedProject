Samples were positive by real time PCR, and sequencing of the amplified product from a capuchin monkey showed 100 per cent similarity to other ZIKV from South America. This is the 1st report on ZIKV detection among Neotropical primates.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall[This important observation raises several key questions related to the potential the role of marmosets and capuchin monkeys as Zika virus reservoirs: (1) do they develop viremias of high enough titer and long enough duration to infect susceptible mosquitoes? (2) Which mosquitoes feed on these primates, become infected and subsequently transmit the virus to other primates? If a sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission becomes established, similar to yellow fever virus and non-human primates in the Amazon Basin, the virus is here to stay, with occasional spill-over to humans. - Mod.TY]******[3] Encephalopathy, adultsDate: Thu 21 Apr 2016Source: Eurosurveillance [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21452>RozÌ© B, Najioullah F, Signate A, Apetse K, Brouste Y, Gourgoudou S, et al, on behalf of the Neuro-Zika Working Group of Martinique. Zika virus detection in cerebrospinal fluid from 2 patients with encephalopathy, Martinique, February 2016.SummaryWe report 2 cases of encephalopathy (one with seizures, one with electroencephalogram changes) in patients with Zika virus infection. The cases occurred on Martinique in February 2016, during the Zika virus outbreak. Awareness of the various neurological complications of Zika virus infection is needed for patients living in areas affected by Zika virus infections or for travellers to these areas.Case 1A previously healthy young adult was admitted to the University Hospital of Martinique, after having experienced an episode of convulsive seizures that occurred 6 hours after the onset of a dengue-like syndrome (fever, arthralgia, asthenia and headache). Upon initial clinical evaluation, the patient was febrile, with a low level of consciousness (Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 9) and no neurological focal signs.Case 2A patient in their late 70s was brought to the University Hospital of Martinique by their family who reported symptoms including acute mental confusion, speech disorder, and right facial palsy, which had started three hours before hospital admission. Upon initial clinical evaluation the patient was afebrile and aphasic; conjunctivitis, bilateral hands oedema, and peripheral arthritis were present. Facial palsy was not noticed upon clinical examination. Aphasia resolved spontaneously 45 minutes after the 1st clinical evaluation.In this report, we present 2 cases of encephalopathy fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of the Consensus Statement of the International Encephalitis Consortium. Based on the laboratory findings, we consider these cases as Zika virus-associated. In keeping with neurological findings in other arbovirus infections, the presentations were of non-specific nature; the spectrum of arboviral neurological disease may even lead to ischemic stroke. Moreover, in arbovirus-related neurological disorders, imaging findings may be normal and different EEG abnormalities can be seen. Zika virus is known as a neurotropic microorganism, however, both structural imaging and EEG can be normal in acute infection.Awareness of the wide spectrum of neurological symptoms of Zika virus infection is needed for patients living in, or travelling to areas affected by Zika virus infections. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of Zika virus infection and the reasons behind its predilection for the CNS is needed to design treatment strategies to mitigate significant morbidity.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These 2 cases illustrate another facet of Zika virus neurotropism, in these cases, encepalopathy in adults. Subscribers interested in the details of these 2 cases are encouraged to read the entire report. It will be of interest to know whether similar cases have been seen in the countries with the most Zika virus infections, Brazil and Colombia. - Mod.TY]******[4] Symptoms and pregnancy status, USADate: Fri 15 Apr 2016Source: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub [edited]<http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6515e1>Dasgupta S, Reagan-Steiner S, Goodenough D, et al. Patterns in Zika virus testing and Infection, by report of symptoms and pregnancy status -- United States, 3 Jan-5 Mar 2016.During 3 Jan-5 Mar 2016, Zika virus testing was performed for 4534 persons from the US states and District of Columbia (DC), among whom 3335 (73 per cent) were pregnant women. Among 1541 persons with one or more Zika-virus associated symptoms who received testing and reported symptoms, 182 (11.8 per cent) had confirmed Zika virus infection. Only 7 (0.3 per cent) of 2425 asymptomatic pregnant women who received testing had confirmed Zika virus infection.These results reflect the current situation in US states and DC, where there is no local mosquitoborne transmission; results of testing in areas with active Zika virus transmission might be different. Although confirmed Zika virus infection was identified in 7 (0.3 per cent) asymptomatic pregnant women who received testing, it is reassuring that the proportion of asymptomatic pregnant women with confirmed Zika virus infection in this report was low. However, because of the potential serious adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes associated with maternal Zika virus infection, health care providers should continue to offer testing to pregnant women with potential exposure to Zika virus, even if they do not have symptoms. Follow-up of women with confirmed Zika virus infection or recent unspecified flavivirus infection during pregnancy is important to identify congenital Zika virus infection and other possible adverse pregnancy outcomes.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall[Although there was no local Zika virus transmission in the USA occurring in the period specified, CDC and state health authorities in southern regions of the country with _Aedes aegypti_ can expect sporadic, locally acquired cases following importation of the virus, as has occurred with dengue virus transmission in the past. - Mod.TY]******[5] Predictive mapDate: Fri 15 Apr 2016Source: Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz.

Mapping the global geographic potential of Zika virus spreadABSTRACTThe Americas are presently experiencing the most serious outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) known. Here, we present a novel set of analyses using environmental characteristics, vector distributions, and socioeconomic risk factors to develop the 1st map to detail global ZIKV transmission risk in multiple dimensions based on ecological niche models. Our model predictions were tested against independent evaluation data sets, and all models had predictive ability significantly better than random expectations. The study addresses urgent knowledge gaps regarding the potential geographic scope of the current ZIKV epidemic, as well as the global potential for spread. It also provides a highly informative view of potential drivers of ZIKV distributions globally, pointing out areas vulnerable in terms of some drivers, but not in others. The results of these analyses can guide regional education and preparedness efforts, such that medical personnel will be prepared for diagnosis of potential ZIKV cases as they appear.We used maximum entropy ecological modeling implemented in Maxent version 3.3 (Phillips et al. 2006) to anticipate the potential distribution of ZIKV worldwide, and to infer major drivers of the spread of the virus. For this reason, we developed 4 models, based on ZIKV occurrences and different combinations of climate, socioeconomic, land-cover, mosquito abundance, and accessibility variables.Our models corroborated ZIKV's large-scale potential for expansion in South and Central America, and identifies other regions at risk of ZIKV transmission, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, Melanesia, and parts of New Zealand. Northern Australia is at risk as a function of vector availability and environmental suitability, but less so based on human conditions. Other at-risk regions include Angola, Zambia, the Amazon Basin, and northern South America. Risk in Europe and northern India was driven mainly by accessibility and socioeconomic factors, respectively.Our models anticipate some potential for autochthonous ZIKV transmission in the USA, although risk areas are generally scattered and narrow. However, Florida, southern Texas, and Louisiana are clearly vulnerable to autochthonous ZIKV transmission. Areas south east of the Appalachians and Pacific coastal areas may also be affected. Other parts of the USA will see imported cases and limited local transmission, particularly if other _Aedes_ species participate in transmission. Large areas of Asia, including densely populated regions, were indicated as at risk for autochthonous ZIKV transmission, including parts of India, Bangladesh, southern China, and Thailand; the south western coast of the Arabian Peninsula is also at risk of ZIKV virus transmission. In western Europe, ZIKV transmission risk is enhanced by travel times and connectivity to known transmission areas; as such, isolated autochthonous cases may occur at least seasonally when competent vector species are present.--communicated by:Dr A M SamyUniversity of Kansas, Lawrence, USAAin Shams University, Abbassia, Cairo, Egypt<asamy.ku@hotmail.com>[This approach may provide a useful tool for health authorities to focus surveillance on areas of greatest risk for outbreaks - Mod.TY]******[6] Zika virus NS1 structureDate: Mon 18 Apr 2016Source: Nature Structural & Molecular Biology doi:10.1038/nsmb.3213 [edited]<http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.3213.html>Hao Song, Jianxun Qi, Joel Haywood, Yi Shi, George F Gao. Zika virus NS1 structure reveals diversity of electrostatic surfaces among flaviviruses.SummaryThe association of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections with microcephaly has resulted in an ongoing public-health emergency. Here we report the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a major host-interaction molecule that functions in flaviviral replication, pathogenesis and immune evasion. Comparison with West Nile and dengue virus NS1 structures reveals conserved features but diverse electrostatic characteristics at host-interaction interfaces, thus possibly implying different modes of flavivirus pathogenesis.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall******[7] Virus thermal stabilityDate: Tue 19 Apr 2016Source: Nature doi:10.1038/nature17994 [edited]<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/full/nature17994.html>Victor A Kostyuchenko, Elisa X Y Lim, Shuijun Zhang, Guntur Fibriansah, Thiam-Seng Ng, Justin S G Ooi, et al. Structure of the thermally stable Zika virus.SummaryZika virus (ZIKV), formerly a neglected pathogen, has recently been associated with microcephaly in fetuses, and with Guillian-Barre syndrome in adults. Here we present the 3.7 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of ZIKV, and show that the overall architecture of the virus is similar to that of other flaviviruses. Sequence and structural comparisons of the ZIKV envelope (E) protein with other flaviviruses show that parts of the E protein closely resemble the neurovirulent West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses, while others are similar to dengue virus (DENV). However, the contribution of the E protein to flavivirus pathobiology is currently not understood. The virus particle was observed to be structurally stable even when incubated at 40 C [104 F], in sharp contrast to the less thermally stable DENV. This is also reflected in the infectivity of ZIKV compared to DENV serotypes 2 and 4 (DENV2 and DENV4) at different temperatures. The cryo-electron microscopy structure shows a virus with a more compact surface. This structural stability of the virus may help it to survive in the harsh conditions of semen, saliva and urine. Antibodies or drugs that destabilize the structure may help to reduce the disease outcome or limit the spread of the virus.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
