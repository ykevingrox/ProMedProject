Epicore Global Surveillance Project [edited]It seems like the isolate is _Salmonella_ Altona. [This is apparent from] the MoH Speaker notification [<http://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/05082016_1.aspx>, in Hebrew] in which the last bullet declares: ""No increase in Salmolella-related illnesses has been noted; the MoH continues to monitor Salmonella illnesses and _Salmonella_ Altona isolates in the MoH central laboratory.""--Communicated by:Epicore Surveillance Project memberEyal Leshem, MD[ProMED-mail thanks Eyal Leshem for promptly submitting the above response to our RFI.The most recent outbreak in humans by _S._ Altona that we have been able to detect is available on the Salmonella homepage of CDC; it dates back to 2011. The bacterium was linked to chicks and ducklings; see 20110617.1847 and <http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/2011/chicks-ducklings-10-6-2011.html>.The report follows:""Salmonella Altona Outbreak InvestigationAs of 4 Oct 2011, a total of 68 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Altona were been reported from 20 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Georgia (1), Illinois (1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (6), Maryland (5), Michigan (1), Minnesota (1), Mississippi (1), New Hampshire (1), New York (4), North Carolina (9), Ohio (12), Pennsylvania (6), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (3), Texas (2), Virginia (7), Vermont (1), Wisconsin (1), and West Virginia (4).Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began between 25 Feb 2011 and 10 Sep 2011. Infected individuals ranged in age from less than one year old to 92 years old, and 31 percent of ill persons were 5 years of age or younger. 51 percent of patients were female. Among the 62 patients with available information, 19 (31 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 42 (74%) of 57 ill persons interviewed reported contact with live poultry (chicks, chickens, ducklings, ducks, geese, and turkeys) before becoming ill. Of ill persons who could recall the type of live poultry with which they had contact, 40 identified chicks, ducklings, or both, and 33 (89 percent) of 37 ill persons with available vendor information reported purchasing chicks and ducklings from multiple locations of a nationwide agriculture feed store, Feed Store Chain A. Ill persons reported purchasing live poultry for either backyard flocks to produce eggs or as pets.In May and June 2011, laboratory testing yielded _Salmonella_ Altona bacteria from multiple samples: 3 samples from a chick and its environment collected from an ill person's household in Ohio, 3 samples collected from chick and duckling displays at 2 locations of Feed Store Chain A in North Carolina, and 3 samples collected from a chicken and 2 ducks from an ill person's household in Vermont. Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live chicks and ducklings from homes of ill persons identified a single mail-order hatchery in Ohio as the source of these chicks and ducklings. In June 2011, the Ohio Department of Agriculture inspected the mail-order hatchery and made recommendations for improvement.""A visit of Israel's MOH epidemiologists to the affected plant was scheduled for today, Sun 7 Aug 2016. Their report and conclusions are expected with interest. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.]
