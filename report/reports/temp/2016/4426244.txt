Bariloche 2000 [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://bariloche2000.com/noticias/leer/murio-el-joven-internado-por-posible-caso-de-hantavirus/101207>A young official of the coastguard who possibly was infected with [a] hantavirus, died at dawn in the Hospital Privado Regional [Rio Negro province]. The individual was 23 years old, worked on the federal force and in recent days had been sent to Los Alerces National Park [Chubut province].The young man was admitted to the health center with flu-like symptoms similar to those of hantavirus [infections], so samples were sent to the Malbran Institute in Buenos Aires to discard or confirm the suspected [disease]. However, unfortunately the patient died before the results came in that would permit knowledge of the cause of death.The man felt seriously ill but was confident that he would progress well. Two days ago he had written a sentimental message to his small daughter saying, ""I promise to come out of this soon and the 3 of us will together be the lovely family that we are,"" he stated.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This sad case certainly puts a human face of the tragedy that hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) can bring and illustrates how quickly HPS can progress. Without differential laboratory tests, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this or the previous 2016 case in Rio Negro province. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 5 years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).Andes virus seems likely in this case. This virus is endemic in the Andean region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Details of possible exposure to Andes virus were not provided, but may have been due to contact with rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta while he was in Los Alerces National Park in Chubut province. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.zonu.com/argentina_maps/Argentina_Regions_Map_2.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11318>. - Mod.TY]
