As a result, a syringe exchange program will be established. Senate Enrolled Act 461 made syringe exchange programs legal in Indiana if certain requirements are met.""As we fight the national opioid epidemic, we have seen time and again that rising hepatitis C rates can be a sign that injection drug use is occurring in a community,"" said State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams. ""Syringe exchange is a tool that can help prevent the spread of disease, so long as it is part of a response that also includes access to testing, treatment and other services critical to improving individuals.""Public health emergencies had previously been declared in Clark, Fayette, Madison, Monroe, Scott and Wayne counties.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed. There is no evidence that government sponsored needle exchange programs increase the amount of substance abuse. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/217>.]
