At least 1 case has been confirmed in Sheboygan County, although the DHS could not be reached for comment to confirm if more than one case had been reported in the county.The CDC has sent additional investigators to Wisconsin to find the source of a blood infection that officials described as the largest outbreak of the bacteria now linked to at least 18 deaths.Wisconsin health officials said on their website Wed 9 Mar 2016, that the total number of reported cases now stands at 48. Infections were centered in the heavily populated southeastern quarter of the state, including the Milwaukee area and surrounding suburban counties. The Sheboygan County case was first reported this week.The majority of patients infected are 65 or older with a history of at least one underlying serious illness, according to the state health department. Those who died all tested positive for the infection, but it's not known if the infection caused or contributed to their deaths.[Byline: Phillip Bock]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 9 Mar 2016Source: WBAY [edited]<http://wbay.com/2016/03/09/new-elizabethkingia-cases-confirmed-in-sheboygan-county/>_Elizabethkingia [anopheles_] is spreading in Wisconsin and traveling north, with 4 new cases reported, according to an update from the Department of Health Services (DHS) Wednesday afternoon, 9 Mar 2016. Previously the cases had been limited to Southern and Eastern Wisconsin, but now Sheboygan County has at least 1 confirmed case.To date there are 48 confirmed cases in Wisconsin, prompting the federal government to send additional investigators to determine the source of the deadly bacterial blood infection which has claimed the lives of 15 people. However, officials can't say if they died from the bacterial infection or an underlying medical issue, since the illness usually affects people with compromised immune systems or serious underlying health conditions. Initially DHS officials reported that 18 people died, but that number was revised to 15 on Wed 9 Mar 2016.Jennifer Miller a communications specialist with DHS says the agency initially reported the incorrect number because DHS couldn't confirm that a patient who died actually had the infection. In other cases, she said a patient may have been counted more than once.On Wed 9 Mar 2016, Gov. Scott Walker appeared in Appleton to meet with Wisconsin's Emergency Management and Homeland Security to address containment of the growing outbreak. Back on 2 Mar 2016, the Wisconsin DHS, Division of Public Health (DPH) announced it is investigating the outbreak.The CDC initially sent 3 investigators to Wisconsin, but that number has now increased to 8, according to Melissa Brower, a public affairs specialist with the CDC. According to Brower, on 8 Feb 2016, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health requested that CDC send a team to assist with their investigation into the outbreak. About a week later, on 14 Feb 2016, 3 CDC staff members traveled to Wisconsin, Brower said. On 23 Feb 2016, 2 more CDC staff members traveled to Wisconsin to provide additional support for the investigation. ""Between 3 and 6 Mar 2016, members of the initial CDC team were swapped out for other CDC staff members, and the total number of CDC staff members in Wisconsin rose to 8,"" Brower said noting that as of right now, Wisconsin is the only state with confirmed cases.According to DHS, cases have been reported in the following counties: Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sauk, Washington, Waukesha, and now Sheboygan County.Most of the patients are over the age of 65, according to State Health Officer Karen McKeown.DPH was first notified of 6 potential cases between 29 Dec 2015 and 4 Jan 2016 and set up statewide surveillance on 5 Jan 2016.Symptoms of _Elizabethkingia_ [infection] include fever, shortness of breath, and chills. There may also be cellulitis, a redness and swelling from a skin infection that may feel hot and tender to the touch. Suspicion of having the infection should be higher if a patient has multiple chronic conditions, including, particularly malignancy, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease or end-stage renal disease on dialysis, alcohol dependence, alcoholic cirrhosis, immune compromising conditions, or immunosuppressive treatment. A lab test is required to confirm a true diagnosis.[Byline: Steve Schuster]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin is the newest county to have reported a case of _E. anopheles_.
