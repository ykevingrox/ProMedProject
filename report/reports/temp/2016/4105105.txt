Mod.JW mentioned that Shanghai is located in one of the southern provinces in China's dengue belt, where the mosquito season will start next month (April), at which time there will be increased risk from inevitable future citizens returning infected from Angola, where thousands of Chinese are engaged in building and infrastructure projects. This situation does not sound the alarm just for China, but for areas in South and Southeast Asia as well, where vector mosquitoes are abundant. Had the infected individual landed in India, Thailand or Indonesia instead of China during the non-vector season, a major public health emergency could have resulted if not detected early, eliciting an aggressive response by public health officials.Maps of Angola can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>.A map of China can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Mods.TY/JW]
