Final results for clinical specimens obtained from the patient are expected to be released on Monday [1 Aug 2016], Dr Jariya Saengsajja said.The unnamed man arrived in Thailand on Monday [25 Jul 2016] with his father and grandmother and fell ill on Tuesday [26 Jul 2016]. The Department of Disease Control's screening measures initially indicated MERS, a highly contagious form of coronavirus. He was sent to the state-owned Bamrasnaradura institute in Nonthaburi on Thursday [28 Jul 2016] and has been treated in an isolation room.Dr Jariya said the patient mainly had fever. His father and grandmother who also had been placed in quarantine were also negative for MERS. However, they needed to be quarantined for 14 days to observe their symptoms before being released.Two known cases of MERS have been confirmed in Thailand, with 2 Omani nationals tested positive for the virus in June last year [2015] and in January [2016].MERS 1st emerged in humans in 2012 and has been spreading in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries since then. It is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). The virus, in which patients develop acute respiratory illness with fever, coughing and breathing problems, has spread to 27 countries and killed up to 40% of those infected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[In the 1st media report that we published on 31 Jul 2016, the report stated that tests were positive for the MERS-CoV: ""Amnuay explained that this teenager, despite detection of the virus in him, was categorised as a person ""likely to fall ill"" from MERS-CoV, apart from 2 other categories of ""confirmed"" patients and the ""variable group."" The tests of his bodily fluids at 4 labs (Medical Science Department, Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Chulalongkorn Hospital and Ramathibodi Hospital) found the virus, but the results had some uncertainty pending confirmation from experts."" (See prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV (86): Thailand ex Kuwait, RFI 20160731.4382012). Unfortunately, there is no further information on the results of the 2nd round of testing to date or clarification of the suggested false positive test results obtained on this individual.We await further information on this event in Thailand.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Thailand can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151> and of Kuwait at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/129>. - Mod.MPP]
