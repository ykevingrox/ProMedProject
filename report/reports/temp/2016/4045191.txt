ECDC [edited]<http://flunewseurope.org/>Week 06/2016 (8-14 Feb 2016)-------------------------------21 of the 46 Member States that reported epidemiological data from surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) indicated increasing rates for week 06/2016; 37 countries reported influenza-virus detections in specimens from sentinel sources, indicating influenza activity in the WHO European Region as a whole.Belarus, Finland, Greece, Ireland and Switzerland indicated high-intensity influenza activity. Influenza activity in the Russian Federation and Ukraine declined from very high in week 05/2016 to medium for week 06/2016.A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses continue to predominate, accounting for 90 percent of subtyped influenza A viruses detected through sentinel surveillance.Cases of severe disease, mainly in people aged 15-64 years, increased again in week 06/2016, with most of them associated with A(H1N1)pdm09.Season---So far, a predominance of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has characterized the 2015-2016 influenza season in most countries in the Region; this virus subtype may cause more severe disease and deaths in adults aged 15-64 years than A(H3N2) viruses.Since week 52/2015, several European countries with sentinel surveillance systems for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) have reported increasing numbers of cases associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Similarly, countries reporting laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) have detected influenza A virus in the majority of cases since the start of the season, with A(H1N1)pdm09 being the dominant subtype.Most of the viruses characterized so far have been similar to the strains recommended for inclusion in this winter's trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines for the northern hemisphere.Risk assessments for the season are available from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.Also see:Table.

There are localized pockets of high activity in parts of the country, and national levels of influenza-like-illness and the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for flu in clinical laboratories continues to increase. H1N1 viruses are most common at this time. This is the same H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 to cause a pandemic. Seasonal flu vaccines have included the H1N1 pandemic virus since 2010. CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older. If you have not gotten vaccinated yet this season, you should get vaccinated now. Below is a summary of the key flu indicators for the week ending 13 Feb 2016:For the week ending 13 Feb 2016, the proportion of people seeing their health care provider (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S4>) for influenza-like illness (ILI) increased from 2.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent, which is above the national baseline (2.1 per cent). Nine of 10 regions (Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10) reported ILI at or above their region-specific baseline levels. One way that CDC measures the length of the influenza season is the number of consecutive weeks during which ILI is at or above the national baseline. ILI has been at or above the national baseline for 5 consecutive weeks so far this season. For the last 13 seasons, the average duration of a flu season by this measure has been 13 weeks, with a range from 1 week to 20 weeks.Puerto Rico and 2 states (Arizona and Oklahoma) experienced high ILI activity. New York City and 11 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah) experienced moderate ILI activity. Six states (California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) experienced low ILI activity. 30 states experienced minimal ILI activity. The District of Columbia and one state (Colorado) did not have sufficient data to calculate an activity level. ILI activity data indicate the amount of flu-like illness that is occurring in each state.Widespread flu activity was reported by Puerto Rico and 12 states (Arizona, California, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont). Regional flu activity was reported by 20 states (Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Washington). The District of Columbia, Guam and 15 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) reported local influenza activity. The U.S. Virgin Islands and 3 states (Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia) reported sporadic influenza activity. Geographic spread data show how many areas within a state or territory are seeing flu activity.Since 1 Oct 2015, 1147 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S6>) have been reported through FluSurv-NET, a population-based surveillance network for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations. This translates to a cumulative overall rate of 4.1 hospitalizations per 100 000 people in the United States. More data on hospitalization rates, including hospitalization rates during other influenza seasons, are available at <http://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html> and <http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/FluHospChars.html>.The highest hospitalization rates are among people 65 years and older (12.7 per 100 000), followed by children younger than 5 years (6.0 per 100 000), and adults 50-64 years (5.2 per 100 000). During most seasons, children younger than 5 years and adults 65 years and older have the highest hospitalization rates.FluSurv-NET hospitalization data (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization>) are collected from 13 states and represent approximately 8.5 per cent of the total U.S. population. The number of hospitalizations reported does not reflect the actual total number of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States.The proportion of deaths (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S2>) attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was below the system-specific epidemic threshold in both the NCHS Mortality Surveillance System and the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System.One death was associated with an influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, and one death was associated with an influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed. Both deaths occurred during week 4 (the week ending 30 Jan 2016).A total of 13 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the 2015-2016 season.Nationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#Viral>) testing positive for influenza viruses in clinical laboratories during the week ending 13 Feb 2016 was 12.0 per cent. For the most recent 3 weeks, the regional percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza viruses in clinical laboratories ranged from 2.2 per cent to 14.6 per cent. During the week ending 13 Feb 2016, of the 2135 influenza-positive tests reported to CDC by clinical laboratories, 1559 (73.0 per cent ) were influenza A viruses, and 576 (27.0 per cent) were influenza B viruses.The most frequently identified influenza virus type reported by public health laboratories during the week ending 13 Feb 2016 was influenza A viruses, with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating.- During the week ending 13 Feb 2016, 423 (72.9 per cent) of the 580 influenza-positive tests reported to CDC by public health laboratories were influenza A viruses, and 157 (27.1 per cent) were influenza B viruses. Of the 412 influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 51 (12.4 per cent) were H3 viruses, and 361 (87.6 per cent) were (H1N1)pdm09 viruses.- Cumulatively, from 4 Oct 2015-13 Feb 2016, influenza A (H3) viruses were predominant in one of the 4 age groups (38.7 per cent in ages 65 years and older). Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant in the 0-4 years age group (64.4 per cent), 5-24 years age group (42.7 per cent), and in the 25-64 years age group (67.1 per cent).CDC has characterized 532 specimens (181 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 228 influenza A (H3N2) and 123 influenza B viruses) collected in the U.S. since 1 Oct 2015.- All 181 (100 per cent) influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized as similar to A/California/7/2009, the influenza A (H1N1) component of the 2015-2016 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.- All 228 H3N2 viruses were genetically sequenced, and all viruses belonged to genetic groups for which a majority of viruses antigenically characterized were similar to cell-propagated A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2015-2016 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.- A subset of 107 H3N2 viruses also were antigenically characterized; 100 of 107 (93.5 per cent) H3N2 viruses were similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 by HI testing or neutralization testing.- All 88 (100 per cent) of the B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were antigenically characterized as similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, which is included in both the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines.- All 35 (100 per cent) of the B/Victoria-lineage viruses were antigenically characterized as similar to B/Brisbane/60/2008, which is included in the 2015-16 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccine.Since 1 Oct 2016, CDC has tested 330 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 261 influenza A (H3N2), and 202 influenza B viruses for resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors antiviral drugs. While the vast majority of the viruses that have been tested are sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, so far this season, 2 (0.6 per cent) influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses have showed resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir (but both were sensitive to zanamivir).FluView (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm>) is available, and past issues are archived (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm>) on the CDC website.Note: Delays in reporting may mean that data changes over time.

This allows the reader to compare states, age groups, years, and more. The 2015-2016 transmission season appears lower than 2010-2011, 2013-2014, 2014-2015. 2009-2010 peaked early then dropped below what we are seeing now in 2015-2016. However, the report notes that cases are on the rise now.

Over the past week, there were only 2614 cases of acute respiratory virus infection, influenza and pneumonia (including 27 cases of influenza, 106 cases of pneumonia, and 2481 cases of respiratory virus infection). The incidence rate is lower than last week [week of 8 Feb 2016] by 32 per cent.Of the total number of cases, 1108 are children under age 17 years, and there is a decline among this age group as well compared with the previous week by 30.7 per cent. Among the schoolchildren, there are 385 cases of influenza, which is below the level of morbidity as compared to last week by 28 per cent. Among adults, there were 1506 cases registered, which is below the level of the previous week by 30.9 per cent. Therefore, the flu epidemic in Mariupol is in decline,"" the report says.However, given predictions about a possible 2nd wave of influenza in Ukraine, the Health Department of the City Council recommends that city residents should stay vigilant and, at the 1st signs of disease, immediately seek medical care.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report states the actual information from the municipal health department website of the city of Mariupol in regards to the situation on incidence of flu for the last week [8-15 Feb 2016]. Compared to other regions of Ukraine, Mariupol was one of the cities of Donezk region that took the 1st blow of the epidemic, along with Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and others. Thanks to the efforts of local physicians, isolation of infected cases, and timely delivery of the necessary medicines to the region, the city managed to stabilize the situation, and, as can be seen from the report, there has been a downward trend in the number of cases.At the same time, the number of deaths from influenza in Ukraine continues to increase [see below]. Since the beginning of the epidemic season (28 Sep 2015-11 Feb 2016) in Ukraine, 273 people died as a result of the flu epidemic. 3.6 million were registered with flu, among them 61.2 percent were children under the age of 17 years (according to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine). Of those, 152 000 people are hospitalized, and 65.6 percent are children. - Corr.VMA map of the Ukraine may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/123>.]******[4] Ukraine: influenza death tollDate: 16 Feb 2016Source: UA Today [edited]<http://uatoday.tv/society/death-toll-from-flu-in-ukraine-reaches-289-592360.html>289 people have died as a result of flu since the beginning of the epidemic season in Ukraine.
