Wellcome Trust [edited]<http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2016/WTP060169.htm>Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergencies------------------------------------------------------The arguments for sharing data, and the consequences of not doing so, have been thrown into stark relief by the Ebola and Zika outbreaks.In the context of a public health emergency of international concern, there is an imperative on all parties to make any information available that might have value in combatting the crisis.We are committed to working in partnership to ensure that the global response to public health emergencies is informed by the best available research evidence and data, as such:- Journal signatories will make all content concerning the Zika virus free to access. Any data or preprint deposited for unrestricted dissemination ahead of submission of any paper will not pre-empt its publication in these journals.- Funder signatories will require researchers undertaking work relevant to public health emergencies to set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities and the World Health Organisation.We urge other organisations to make the same commitments.This commitment is in line with the consensus statement agreed at a WHO expert consultation on data sharing last year [2015] whereby researchers are expected to share data at the earliest opportunity, once they are adequately controlled for release and subject to any safeguards required to protect research participants and patients.Signatories to the StatementAcademy of Medical Sciences, UKBill and Melinda Gates FoundationBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)The British Medical Journal (BMJ)Bulletin of the World Health OrganizationCanadian Institutes of Health ResearchThe Centers for Disease Control and PreventionChinese Academy of SciencesChinese Centre for Disease Control and PreventionThe Department of Biotechnology, Government of IndiaThe Department for International Development (DFID)Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)eLifeThe Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)F1000Fondation MerieuxFundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz)Institut PasteurJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)The JAMA NetworkThe LancetMedecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF)National Academy of MedicineNational Institutes of Health, USANational Science Foundation, USAThe New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)PLOSScience JournalsSouth African Medical Research CouncilSpringer NatureUK Medical Research CouncilWellcome TrustZonMw - The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Additional information can be accessed atDye C, Bartolomeos K, Moorthy V, Kieny MP: Data sharing in public health emergencies: a call to researchers.
