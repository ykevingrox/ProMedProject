The slum, located close to Naveen Nivas, drew attention as a medical team rushed to the area to take stock of the situation.Preliminary investigation revealed that use of well water, which appeared to be contaminated, was the reason behind the water-borne disease. Disinfection of the well water was carried out. However, that was not the only area of the city where the disease outbreak was reported. In Thoria Sahi near Damana, another 5 persons have been tested positive for jaundice during the 1st 4 days of the month [April 2016]. Use of contaminated supply water was the reason there too.In Cuttack, so far, 52 jaundice cases have been reported from Wards 33, 41 and 44 in the last 3 weeks. The PHED [Public Health Engineering Department] water supply was found to have come in contact with sewer lines leading to the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The etiology of this presumed waterborne outbreak of hepatitis is not stated but is likely to be either type A or E.
