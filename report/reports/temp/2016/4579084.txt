Evening Telegraph (UK) [summarised, edited]<https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/puppy-diagnosed-plague-bug/>Lily, a 5-month-old boxer puppy from Dundee [has been found] harbouring _Yersinia enterocolitica_.The owner said: ""When the vet phoned, my 1st thought was that my puppy was going to die. Then I thought that I was going to be responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of people. It was a massive shock to say the least [see comment]. We had bought Lily, and she was passing very loose stools, so we took her to the vet. The 1st tests came back last week, and they said that she had cryptosporidium, a condition that affects the gut and intestinal area. Then we got a call to say that the results had come back positive for something different: _Yersinia enterocolitica_.""The condition can be passed to humans, although experts say that incidences are very rare.In March last year [2015], a 2-year-old male American Pit Bull Terrier was euthanised after contracting the condition. His owner also began displaying health problems, including a bloody cough and fever, and was diagnosed with the plague. Three other people in the US contracted the disease, but all recovered after treatment.[The owner] decided to speak out to raise awareness of the condition. She said: ""If my puppy has it, who is to say that other people's don't too? The vet has said it is very rare, but, hypothetically, my puppy could have picked it up in the city. Maybe it isn't as rare as we think; maybe people aren't testing for it. I just want people to be aware that if their dog is exhibiting symptoms then they should have it tested.""Lily is now on a course of antibiotic treatment for her condition, and her owner faces an agonising wait to see whether she recovers.She said: ""Lily is part of the family, and hopefully she isn't going anywhere for a long time. That said, it is a very dangerous thing that she is carrying.""[Byline: Adam Hill]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The owner of the above described dog was alarmed, fearing bubonic plague. However, the causative agent of bubonic plague is _Yersinia pestis_, not _Y. enterocolitica_. Regarding the latter, the following paper may shed some light on the described event (references deleted):1. Stamm, M. Hailer, B. Depnerb, P. A. Kopp and J. Rau (2013). _Yersinia enterocolitica_ in Diagnostic Fecal Samples from European Dogs and Cats: Identification by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. J. Clin. Microbiol. (2013) 51 (3) pp 887-893 <http://jcm.asm.org/content/51/3/887.long>.Abstract:_Yersinia enterocolitica_ is the main cause of yersiniosis in Europe, one of the 5 main bacterial gastrointestinal diseases of humans. Beside pigs, companion animals, especially dogs and cats, were repeatedly discussed in the past as a possible source of pathogenic _Y. enterocolitica_. To investigate the presence and types of _Y. enterocolitica_ in companion animals, a total of 4325 diagnostic fecal samples from dogs and 2624 samples from cats were tested. The isolates obtained were differentiated by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Isolated _Y. enterocolitica_ strains were bioserotyped. The detection of the ail gene by PCR and confirmation by FT-IR were used as a pathogenicity marker. _Y. enterocolitica_ strains were isolated from 198 (4.6 percent) of the dog and 8 (0.3 percent) of the cat fecal samples investigated. 179 isolates from dogs were analyzed in detail. The virulence factor Ail was detected in 91.6 percent of isolates. Isolates of biotype 4 (54.7 percent) and, to a lesser extent, biotypes 2 (23.5 percent), 3 (11.2 percent), and 5 (2.2 percent) were detected. The remaining 8.4 percent of strains belonged to the ail-negative biotype 1A. All 7 isolates from cats that were investigated in detail were ail positive. These results indicate that companion animals could be a relevant reservoir for a broad range of presumptively human-pathogenic _Y. enterocolitica_ types. MALDI-TOF MS and FT-IR proved to be valuable methods for the rapid identification of _Y. enterocolitica_, especially in regard to the large number of samples that were investigated in a short time frame"".The following section from the discussion chapter of the above paper addresses clinical yersiniosis in dogs:""In this study, fecal samples were obtained from dogs and cats suspected of having gastrointestinal symptoms; these symptoms may include diarrhea of various degrees and durations, colitis, as well as dysbacteriosis. Additionally, it can be assumed that an unknown number of samples were obtained from apparently healthy animals as part of a wellness test or therapeutic monitoring. Dogs and cats presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms may have other enteric pathogens that might contribute to the clinical signs. These samples were not examined for viral pathogens and only infrequently tested for endoparasites.""_Y. enterocolitica_ was detected in 198 of the 4325 canine fecal samples. In 63.6 percent of these cases, _Y. enterocolitica_ was the only bacterial pathogen isolated, while in the remaining samples, other enteropathogenic bacteria were detected along with _Y. enterocolitica_.""It is not clear whether seasonality plays a role in the prevalence of _Y. enterocolitica_; however, previous studies have shown no increase in the rate of isolation of this organism from dogs during winter months. ""The overall prevalence of 4.6 percent for _Y. enterocolitica_ is an indication of the possible virulence of this organism for dogs, particularly because most isolates (91.6 percent) were of ail-positive bioserotypes, a rate which is remarkably high for this kind of sample.""As sources of _Y. enterocolica_ infection in dogs, the consumption of raw pig meat and milk were suggested. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/280>.]
