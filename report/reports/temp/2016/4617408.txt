Our members like Erick make us the globally important disease report source that we are.In May 2016, we had a report of 16 people treated and discharged after consuming meat from 4 slaughtered sick cows in Gikomora Village in Murang'a suspected to have been infected with anthrax, among them were 10 children, 5 men, and a woman [see Anthrax - Kenya (02): (MU) human, bovine 20160511.4215926].Murang'a County is one of the counties of Kenya's former Central Province. Its largest town is Murang'a its capital, called Fort Hall in colonial times (before 1963). It is inhabited mainly by and is considered the home of the Kikuyu, the largest community in Kenya. The county has a population of 942 581 (2009 census). (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muranga_County>). The map at <http://softkenya.com/county/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2015/05/Counties-in-Kenya.jpg> shows the county in central Kenya.Livestock anthrax is an annual constant in what was the Central Province of Kenya. Considering its close proximity to the capital Nairobi one is surprised that they have not initiated a proactive control and surveillance program for this region. Until they do, we will see repeated events such as this. So far they are lucky that no one may have died. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12065>.][See Also:Anthrax - Kenya (07): (NK) human, bovine 20160704.4325419Anthrax - Kenya (06): (NK) human, bovine 20160702.4323118Anthrax - Kenya (05): (NK) human, bovine 20160701.4321711Anthrax - Kenya (04): (KB) human, bovine, susp, NOT 20160628.4314345Anthrax - Kenya (03): (KB) human, bovine, susp, RFI 20160627.4312495Anthrax - Kenya (02): (MU) human, bovine 20160511.4215926Anthrax - Kenya: foiled anthrax attack, susp ISIS 20160504.42021462015---Anthrax - Kenya (06): (NT) bovine, susp.
