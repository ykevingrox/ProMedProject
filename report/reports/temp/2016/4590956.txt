The posting uses the phrase ""snail fever"" a lay term for schistosomiasis, but it can not be concluded that the 327 cases had Katayama fever, an acute febrile reaction to a 1st time infection with _Schistosoma_ spp, and it is unlikely to find 327 newly infected cases with Katayama fever in a highly endemic area. Rather, one would expect to find individuals with haematuria or gastrointestinal complaints. Diagnosis would usually be by demonstrating eggs in urine or feces, but whether diagnostics were used here or treatment just administered based on symptoms, is not known. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41130>.][See Also:Schistosomiasis - Liberia: (GB): 20161026.4586691Schistosomiasis - Burkina Faso: decreased prevalence post control: 20160104.39105422015----Schistosomiasis - Tanzania: (KL): 20150429.33311882014----Schistosomiasis - Sudan: (Darfur): 20140517.2479628HIV - Africa: possible transmission link to schistosomiasis: 20140516.24723072013----Schistosomiasis - Uganda: (KA) travelers, altitude. 20131123.20707722012----Schistosomiasis - Sudan: (KN): 20121227.1469487].................................................ep/mj/mpp"
