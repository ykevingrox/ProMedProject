PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016;10(4):e0004534, available at <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004534>] and I would like to offer a clarification.The Moderator is correct that _Cryptosporidium_ spp. is not a tropical parasite. Many news agencies reported our findings with a similar headline, but this was not suggested in our report. Rather, this outbreak investigation provides 2 new insights:First, we detail the sustained transmission of human cryptosporidiosis in the Arctic, moving across 10 remote villages over a period of more than 1 year, in a region where this disease was not previously known. The annual incidence rates (IR) in Nunavik for 2013 and 2014 were respectively 322.5 and 246.4 / 100 000 persons, compared to an IR of 2.4 / 100 000 persons for Canada as a whole in 2013.Second, the identification by molecular typing of _C. hominis_ subtype Id in all specimens tested rules-out zoonotic transmission for these specimens, though the possibility remains that other _Cryptosporidium_ subtypes could have been present in specimens that were not characterised. Anthroponotic genospecies of _Cryptosporidium_, with epidemiologic features that suggest sustained person-to-person transmission, are more typically seen in low-income countries than elsewhere in North-America.Sporadic human infections with subtype Id have previously been reported in Ontario and British Columbia, but not in Arctic ecosystems. No animal-derived subtype Id strains have been described. To the best of our knowledge, the _C. hominis_ ""Id subtypes"" identified in this study have not been reported previously in Canada.There are no farm livestock animals in most Arctic regions. However, in Nunavik, _Cryptosporidium_ spp. has been previously detected in ringed seals, bearded seals and blue mussels, making food-borne transmission through the consumption of marine animals a possible route of infection. Elsewhere in Arctic North America, dogs and caribou have been found to carry _Cryptosporidium_ and may be another source of zoonotic infection. Indeed, in contrast to the current report, the only other study involving the molecular characterization of _Cryptosporidium_ infections in humans in the Arctic, reported only _C. parvum IIa_ in diarrhoeic patients in Nunavut [Iqbal A, Goldfarb DM, Slinger R and Dixon BR.; Prevalence and molecular characterization of _Cryptosporidium_ spp. and _Giardia duodenalis_ in diarrhoeic patients in the Qikiqtani Region, Nunavut, Canada. Int J Circumpolar Health. 2015;74, available at <http://www.circumpolarhealthjournal.net/index.php/ijch/article/view/27713>]The high IR of the Nunavik outbreak and the recent recognition of widespread human cryptosporidiosis in neighboring Nunavut are cause for concern about the possible long-term effects on growth and development of children in Inuit communities facing myriad other challenges. Though repeated enteric infections are thought to be prevalent in these regions, little data currently inform our understanding of their clinical burden and etiologic spectrum. Such data are needed for the development of preventive strategies that take into account human practices and environmental changes that disproportionately affect the Arctic.--Cedric YansouniDivision of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical MicrobiologyMcGill University Health Centre, MontrÌ©alCanada<cpyansouni@yahoo.ca>[ProMED thanks Professor Cedric Yansouni for this clarifying comments.
