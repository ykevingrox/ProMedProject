He went on to say that the vaccination campaign will be implemented in 2 stages, with the 1st one covering the urban zone, the 2nd one the rural area, and it will last 7 days.Frederico Carlos Juliana said that the campaign counts on the involvement of over 1800 vaccinators, including health technicians from the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) and National Police, as well as medical students.Since the appearance of the outbreak in the province, whose 1st cases were notified last 27 Jan [2026], about 282 cases have already been recorded, with 64 deaths.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Huambo is one of Angola's 16 provinces that has reported yellow fever (YF) cases, of the total of the country's 18 provinces. Efforts for YF vaccination have been focused on the Luanda area, where most of the cases have been reported. There has been concern expressed recently that there is not enough vaccine to cover the Luanda area, but apparently there is vaccine available for Huambo with the intensive vaccination campaign that has just been started. The Angola situation illustrates the logistical and administrative challenge for control when geographically diverse foci of infection occur at the same time. No mention is made of control efforts going on in the other affected provinces outside of Luanda.Huambo city is the capital of Huambo province and is located 600 km (373 miles) southeast of Luanda, where the major YF outbreak is occurring.
