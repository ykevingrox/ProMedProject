The official said 50 children were diagnosed with the diseases in the 3 villages.No fewer than 3 children have died of measles and whooping cough in 3 villages of Babura Local Government Area of Jigawa State.The council's head of water sanitation and hygiene, Malam Umar Maisule, confirmed this through the council's information officer, Alhaji Sulaiman Doro.He said that the local council had already released N50 000 [about USD 250] for the purchase of drugs and advised parents in the area to take their children to designated centres for routine immunization. According to him, the council has reached out to the state Ministry of Health for additional vaccines.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2594>.]******[2] Liberia (Margibi)Date: Tue 22 Mar 2016Source: Star Africa, APA (African Press Agency) report [edited]<http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-measles-outbreak-reported-in-north-western-liberia.html>Liberia: Measles outbreak reported in north western Liberia-----------------------------------------------------------The acting health officer in Margibi County in north western Liberia, Dr Adolphus T Yeah, has reported an outbreak of measles in the county.In an interview with reporters in Kakata on Monday [21 Mar 2016], Dr Yeah said the measles outbreak has spread to all parts of Margibi County, with the Mamba-Kaba area reporting the highest number of cases, representing about 63 per cent of the total number of cases reported thus far. Dr Yeah said there are currently a total of 33 suspected cases out of which 26 have been confirmed with at least one death.He also disclosed that as a result of the measles outbreak in the county, he has by directive of the minister of health Dr Bernice Dahn restored the county Incident Management System (IMS) to its full level. Dr Yeah said the restoration of the county IMS means that they will treat it like any other contagious disease as in the case of the Ebola virus disease (EVD). He further disclosed that all health facilities in the county are in full gear to combat the outbreak.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32484>.]******[3] USA: link to vaccine refusalsDate: Mon 21 Mar 2016Source: MicroCap Magazine [edited]<http://microcapmagazine.com/2016-03-21-mission-vaccination-aware-measles-whooping-cough/>A comprehensive new study of measles and pertussis outbreaks in the United States suggests that adults' reluctance or refusal to vaccinate themselves and their children has played a key role in the resurgence of diseases that had been largely eradicated in this country.In an analysis published on Tuesday [15 Mar 2016] in the Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA], epidemiologists scoured reports of measles and pertussis outbreaks to glean what role vaccination refusal and hesitance played. They also considered the effect of waning immunity among those who were vaccinated.In measles outbreaks, the role of the unvaccinated was powerful, they found. Of 1416 measles cases since the disease ceased to circulate in the United States in 2000, 57 per cent were in people who had no history of being vaccinated. About 70 per cent of these patients were unvaccinated due to nonmedical exemptions.Using the reports to draw a ""cumulative epidemic curve"" -- the trajectory of the infection's spread -- the researchers found that unvaccinated individuals tended to be among the 1st few groups of people to contract the measles and pass them along. That suggests that unvaccinated people ignited many of the outbreaks -- and were a key accelerant in their spread.Measles can cause serious health problems, particularly in children under 5 and adults over 20. Inner ear infections, which can cause hearing loss, are not unusual. As many as 5 per cent of children who get measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1000 will develop swelling in the brain, which can cause seizures and lead to deafness or intellectual disability. Death is a rare complication, but occurs in 1 or 2 children per 1000 infected.The researchers found a slightly different picture regarding outbreaks of pertussis, which is also known as whooping cough. Of the more than 10 000 cases that occur annually, outbreaks frequently occurred among the vaccinated -- a sign that the DTaP vaccine (which protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) does not confer lasting immunity to all who get it.Researchers reviewed 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks involving 10 069 patients whose vaccination status was known. Unvaccinated and undervaccinated individuals accounted for between 24 per cent and 45 per cent of the infected patients in 5 of the largest statewide epidemics in the analysis, including the 2010 and 2014 outbreaks in California.In 8 of 12 pertussis outbreaks where vaccination data had been collected, between 59 per cent and 93 per cent of the unvaccinated patients who became ill were left unvaccinated for nonmedical reasons.Pertussis is particularly dangerous for babies in their 1st year of life, with nearly half requiring hospitalization and 1 per cent dying of the disease. About 5 per cent of teens and adults who contract the disease require hospitalization, while 4 per cent to 6 per cent will lose consciousness from coughing or fracture a rib during a coughing spasm.Dr Matthew M Davis, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan who wasn't involved in the study, noted that low levels of vaccination and waning vaccine immunity are distinct but related problems. When a growing slice of a given population declines to be vaccinated against a disease, the likelihood of an outbreak increases. At that point, people whose immunity has begun to wane can sustain the outbreak, he wrote in a commentary that was also published in JAMA.If populations are to be protected adequately against vaccine-preventable diseases, Davis wrote, both problems must be addressed.The researchers who conducted the comprehensive tally of outbreaks wrote that ""the risks of vaccine refusal remain imperfectly defined."" Those risks appear to vary for different diseases and in different populations, they added.But if governmental bodies demand that parents vaccinate their children even if they're reluctant to do so, it's important that the risks posed by vaccine refusers -- to themselves and to others -- be clear and well-documented, they wrote.Public officials must also ""address the reasons for vaccine hesitancy,"" they wrote. Among those reasons, they noted, were ""parental perceptions regarding the risk and severity of vaccine-preventable diseases, the safety and effectiveness of routine immunizations, and confidence in medical professionals, corporations, and the healthcare system.""[byline: Kevin B Atencio]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The JAMA paper [Varun K Phadke, Robert A Bednarczyk, Daniel A Salmon, Saad B Omer.

Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Improved understanding of the association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed.'Objective""To review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine delay, refusal, or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 vaccine-preventable diseases with recent US outbreaks.""Evidence review""Search of PubMed through [30 Nov 2015] for reports of US measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the United States (after [1 Jan 2000]), endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in US pertussis incidence (after [1 Jan 1977]), and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of vaccine delay or exemption.""Findings""We identified 18 published measles studies (9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak reports), which described 1416 measles cases (individual age range, 2 weeks-84 years; 178 cases younger than 12 months) and more than half (56.8 per cent) had no history of measles vaccination. Of the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being vaccine eligible and 405 (70.6 per cent) of these had nonmedical exemptions (for example, exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons, as opposed to medical contraindications; 41.8 per cent of total). Among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks, which included 10Ûø609 individuals for whom vaccination status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years), the 5 largest statewide epidemics had substantial proportions (range, 24-45 per cent) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. However, several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations, indicating waning immunity. Nine reports (describing 12 outbreaks) provided detailed vaccination data on unimmunized cases; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59 per cent through 93 per cent of unvaccinated individuals were intentionally unvaccinated.""Conclusions and relevance""A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some populations.""- Mod.LM]******[4] Canada (Ontario)Date: Sun 20 Mar 2016Source: Northumberland News [edited]<http://www.northumberlandnews.com/news-story/6398564-case-of-measles-confirmed-in-brampton/>Case of measles confirmed in Brampton-------------------------------------Health officials in Brampton, Ontario, are warning that residents may have been exposed to measles between [12 and 17 Mar 2016]. A representative from Peel Public Health says the organization has confirmed that a child in Brampton has measles. They say the child had travelled to a measles-endemic country right before becoming ill.Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads easily to those who are not immune or are vulnerable, but people who have had 2 doses of the measles vaccine are not at risk.Health officials say that anyone who thinks they may have been exposed should watch for a high fever, cold-like symptoms, sore eyes or sensitivity to light, small spots with a white centre on the inside of the mouth, and a red rash that lasts 4 to 7 days. Anyone who shows symptoms should call their health care provider immediately.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>.]******[5] Taiwan ex ChinaDate: Wed 23 Mar 2016Source: Taiwan CDC [in Chinese, machine trans., edited]<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/pda/Info.aspx?treeid=45da8e73a81d495d&nowtreeid=1bd193ed6dabaee6&tid=C6513D873928447A>Measles imported from China---------------------------A woman has contracted measles, the 1st case of this year [2016], which acts as a reminder for people to get measles vaccination in endemic areas or evaluation in the event of developing symptoms.The Disease Control Department announced this year's 1st confirmed cases of measles, a 48 year old woman in Taipei, on 12 Mar [2016] She presented with fever and general weakness in clinic on [14 Mar 2016], and developed rash, conjunctivitis, painful urination. Measles was confirmed on [21 Mar 2016]; she has recovered and is no longer in isolation. Because the case had, from 2 to 5 Mar [2016], traveled to mainland China, it is judged to be [an imported] case.The disease department said health authorities have launched an epidemiological investigation, and identified 231 contacts (54 have been traced, 175 tracked, 2 lost contact), including family members, colleagues and contacts related to the medical treatment, health care workers and patients, who have not yet developed measles symptoms, and are expected to be followed up to [7 Apr 2016]. The case [is likely to have been infectious] between [12 and 20 Mar 2016] and, in addition to attending clinics and hospitals, she took the MRT ""Taipei Metro Line 3"" from home and work [on 14 and 15 Mar 2016] travelling at 8:30 am or so from Nanjing Sanmin station and Zhongshan station and returning at around 18:00 from Zhongshan station to Nanjing Sanmin station.The Disease Control Department [UNDCP} says that measles vaccination is the most effective way of preventing the disease. Children from the age of 1 year old should get vaccinated as soon as possible. There are concerns about whether whether antibodies may decrease with age,  so adults, youth groups, those who visit endemic areas, may be well advised to assess vaccination requirements. Returning from endemic areas, in the event of fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cough, rash and other symptoms, people should seek medical treatment as soon as possible, wear a mask, and inform physicians of travel and contact history.
