Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-traveler-contracts-brucellosis-after-consuming-lamb-soup-57505/>A Hong Kong woman has reportedly contracted the bacterial disease, brucellosis, after traveling to Mainland China, according to Hong Kong officials.On 19 May 2016, the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) recorded a case of brucellosis affecting a 51-year-old woman with underlying illnesses. She presented with on and off abdominal pain and fever since 13 Apr 2016 and was admitted to a public hospital twice from 18 to 20 Apr 2016 and from 12 to 26 May 2016, respectively.Her blood specimen collected on 13 May 2016 yielded _Brucella melitensis_. She was treated with antimicrobials and her condition was stable.She had traveled to Mainland China in mid-March 2016 and had a history of preparing soup with lamb placenta and meat during her stay. She had consumed the soup and lamb meat but not the lamb placenta. Her home contacts were asymptomatic. She had no occupational exposure to animals, their carcasses or internal organs. She reported no history of contact with live animals. Investigation is on-going.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people can get the disease when they are in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacterium. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Brucellosis is zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by direct contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with _B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle) and _B. suis_ (swine).The infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis.Localized infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system (1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). Genitourinary [GU] brucellosis may present identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).References----------1.
