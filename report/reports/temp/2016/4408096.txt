The latest happened in Ingham County just last week.As folks were enjoying the Ingham County Fair Friday [5 Aug 2016] night, one exhibit was off limits. A barn holding dozens of pigs was shut down because of a death [of a pig - Mod.TG]. ""Upon further diagnostic testing of that pig, we learned Friday evening that that pig was positive for influenza A,"" said Dr James Averill, state veterinarian with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. That's a type of flu that can spread to other animals and humans.Hearing about swine flu is concerning for a lot of people. But health officials say it's rare. ""The highest risk was to the exhibitors and their family and friends that were there. If you are among the general public, you are at a lower risk,"" Dr Averill said [especially as the barn was shut down to minimize contact with people - Mod.TG].The state vet's office in Lansing is waiting to hear how that pig died. Testing has to be done and could take several days. ""There could have been other things that led to the death. Like the elements, or if there was some other disease,"" Dr Averill said.An exhibitor who doesn't want to be identified told 6 News that pigs were sick several days before the barn was shut down, and fair officials didn't do anything. ""The protocol was followed. They notified our office, and we were in conversation with them,"" Dr Averill said. Dr Averill said when the pigs left the fairgrounds for processing, none of them had fevers. Even if they did, he added that flu cannot be spread by eating pork.So far, there haven't been any confirmed illnesses [of swine or people? - Mod.TG] from the Ingham County Fair. Last month [July 2016] in Muskegon County, 2 people got the flu from a sick pig. But still, Dr Averill said there's no need to worry about an outbreak. ""Everyone is on alert and trying to watch or encourage the fairs to work with their fair veterinarian and monitor the pigs' health,"" he said.[byline: Aaron Dimick]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This could be H3N2 influenza virus, as was discovered in the previous Michigan county fair [see ProMED-mail posting 20160807.439946: Influenza, swine (02): USA (MI) human case, H3N2V].While no human cases have currently been identified at this particular fair, the issue of sick swine is concerning. It is further disturbing that, allegedly, the swine had evidence of illness for some period of time before the barn was closed. Hopefully, the show veterinarian was involved in the case very early on, but this is not clear.Hopefully the people closest to the animal are being monitored, as the exposure source is again close contact with pigs as previously reported (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794729>). - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
