However, we know in some areas vaccinations rates are dropping and I would urge any parent to prioritise the vaccination for their baby and any other members of the family who may not be protected.""Most measles sufferers develop a fever, cough, red eyes, a blocked nose and a blotchy rash.It is also important if you think you may have measles to phone your GP or local hospital before attending. Those with symptoms are asked not to socialise with children, or other vulnerable individuals including infants, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system for around 10 days after symptoms start.More information about measles is available from the Public Health Wales website: <http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?orgId=457&pid=25444> [including a figure and table of incidence of measles from 1996-2012 by year of occurrence and age of patient - Mod.LK].[Byline: Steffan Thomas]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the United Kingdom may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/281>. - Mod.LK]******[2] USA (North Carolina) ex EuropeDate: Tue 2 Aug 2016Source: WRAL [edited]<http://www.wral.com/wake-investigating-suspected-measles-case/15897366/>After overseas trip [to Europe], Wake [North Carolina] resident could have spread measles at home--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Wake County public health officials said Tue [2 Aug 2016] that a local resident has contracted measles.The unidentified patient showed symptoms of measles after returning from travel in Europe, officials said.Measles is a highly contagious disease that is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
