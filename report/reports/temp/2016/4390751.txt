Symptoms include a headache, fever, and stiff neck. Meningitis, which can be fatal, is spread through respiratory droplets, for example through coughing or sneezing.According to a [1 Aug 2016] statement issued by the Italian bishops' conference, the members of the girl's pilgrimage group have taken prophylaxis as a precaution.The conference advised all World Youth Day pilgrims who passed through the Italian House -- the center in Krakow, which served Italian pilgrims -- to undergo the same prophylaxis, per the advice of the Vienna hospital.Those at risk of exposure who experience a high fever, headache, sore throat, vision problems, or loss of consciousness should go immediately to the hospital, as these symptoms could indicate an infection, the statement advised.The bishops' conference offered its condolences to the girl's family, ""at the conclusion of an experience which was a lesson in fraternity and sharing.""Tens of thousands of Italians were among the many pilgrims to attend World Youth Day in Krakow, which at its peak was attended by as many as 2 million people during its final days.--Communicated by:Zbigniew Halat, MD,Medical Epidemiology ConsultantHealth Risk Management & CommunicationPoland<drhalat@halat.com>******[2]Date: Tue 2 Aug 2016Source: Catholic Herald, Catholic News Service report [edited]<http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/08/02/health-alert-for-italian-wyd-pilgrims-after-young-woman-dies-of-meningitis/>After an Italian pilgrim to World Youth Day in Krakow, Poland, died of meningitis, the Italian bishops' conference advised all pilgrims who visited or attended events at its Casa Italia centre in Krakow to see a doctor, especially if they have a high fever, severe headache, and rash.The young female pilgrim from Rome died on [1 Aug 2016] in Vienna, where her group stopped on the way back from Italy, according to a note from the Italian bishops' conference, which did not release the young woman's name.As a precaution, the bishops' statement said, doctors in Vienna administered the antibiotic ciprofloxacin to all the members of the young woman's group and recommended the same for other pilgrims who stayed at Casa Italia or spent a significant amount of time there.The Casa Italia centre was set up at Krakow's Church of St Bernard of Siena and the adjoining convent.
