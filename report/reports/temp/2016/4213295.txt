Angola Press Agency (Angop) [edited]<http://bit.ly/1Tze8ZH>Due to the emergence of numerous cases of viral conjunctivitis, a highly contagious and some serious, the provincial government of Luanda calls for the population to strengthen preventive measures to avoid its spread.Speaking to Angop, the director of the Provincial Health Office, Rosa Bessa, said conjunctivitis is a seasonal disease, which always takes place in a certain time of year, just after the rainy season.She added that the infected persons must meet some special care with hygiene to help control the spread and evolution of conjunctivitis.Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, transparent and thin membrane covering the front of the eyeball (whites of the eyes) and inner eyelids. In general, it attacks both eyes and can last for a week or to 15 days.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Angola can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/angola.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12461>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Tonga (Tongatapu)Date: Mon 9 May 2016Source: Matangi Tonga Online [edited]<http://matangitonga.to/2016/05/09/conjunctivitis-outbreak-tongatapu>A conjunctivitis (pink eye) outbreak in Tongatapu, has seen 135 people flocking to Vaiola Hospital this morning [9 May 2016] with confirmed symptoms of the virulent eye infection. In the last 5 weeks the hospital has registered more cases of conjunctivitis than for the whole of 2015. Conjunctivitis is a common eye infection that causes redness and inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye (the conjunctiva). Symptoms may include redness, itchiness, watery eyes, sticky yellow eye discharge. It is highly contagious.Savelina Veamatahau, Vaiola Hospital's eye practitioner confirmed that just this morning [9 May 2016] she registered around 135 people who came into the hospital with conjunctivitis. She said this disease can easily spread from the affected person to another person through direct contact by the secretion from the affected eyes, or through sharing things like a towel or pillow. Most of the people who presented with symptoms had contracted conjunctivitis from their families, because they live together making it easier for it to spread, while some are co-workers, she said. The 1st conjunctivitis cases for the year [2016] were reported at the hospital in March, with 44 people. ""This number spiked up to 367 in April alone"" she said. Last [Mon 2 May 2016], the hospital registered more than 50 people with conjunctivitis. ""This number dropped to around 30 on [Fri 6 May 2016], and we thought it had declined, but this morning [9 May 2016] it went up again with more than 100 people turning up with conjunctivitis at the hospital, she said.Conjunctivitis caused by [viruses] can be eliminated through personal hygiene like washing the discharge of eyes, washing face and hands with soap several times a day, avoid touching or rubbing the eye, avoid sharing towels, pillows, or other things that have been used by the affected person. The hospital prescribes eye-drops to help the patient recover faster. Savelina said they confirmed the outbreak when they started getting the 1st cases in March [2016] and held public radio programs to make people aware. This week [week of 9 May 2016], the Ministry of Health is expected to strengthen its public awareness with television public health programs on the outbreak.In 2015 alone, the hospital registered just more than 400 conjunctivitis cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Tonga can be seen at <http://www.infoplease.com/atlas/country/tonga.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25323>. Tongatapu is the main island of the Kingdom of Tonga and the location of its capital Nuku'alofa.Conjunctivitis, also known as ""red"" or ""pink"" eye, is a common, self-limiting condition that is most typically caused by adenoviruses. Other viruses that can be responsible for conjunctival infection include herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), picornavirus (enterovirus 70, coxsackie A24), poxvirus (molluscum contagiosum, vaccinia), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The inflammation is usually accompanied by a discharge of varying viscosity. A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis.Signs and symptoms of viral conjunctivitis may include Itchy eyes, tearing/watering of eyes redness, discharge, and sensitivity to light (with corneal involvement). Generally, a diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis is made on the clinical features alone. Lab tests are typically not necessary, but they may be helpful in some cases.Large outbreaks of conjunctivitis, as are currently occurring in Angola and Tonga, are commonly due to viruses (such as adenoviruses and enteroviruses), adenoviruses being most common (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf>).Conjunctivitis due to adenoviruses is spread through hand-to-eye contact or by contact with objects, such as ophthalmologic equipment contaminated with infectious tears, eye discharge, or respiratory discharges. There may be prolonged shedding of adenovirus; a person can be contagious a few days before developing symptoms up to approximately 14 days after symptom onset (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf>).Treatment of viral conjunctivitis caused by adenoviruses is supportive. Patients should be instructed to use cold compresses and lubricants, such as artificial tears, for comfort. Topical vasoconstrictors and antihistamines may be used for severe itching but generally are not indicated. For patients who may be susceptible, a topical astringent or antibiotic may be used to prevent bacterial superinfection.Patients with conjunctivitis caused by other viruses such as HSV usually are treated with topical antiviral agents, including idoxuridine solution and ointment, vidarabine ointment, and trifluridine solution. Treatment of VZV eye disease includes oral acyclovir to terminate viral replication (<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1191370-overview>).Preventing transmission of viral conjunctivitis is important as it is a highly contagious condition. Both patient and provider should wash hands thoroughly and often, keep hands away from the infected eye, and avoid sharing towels, linens, and cosmetics. Infected patients should be advised to stay home from school and work. Those who wear contact lenses should be instructed to discontinue lens wear until signs and symptoms have resolved. - Mod.UBA]
