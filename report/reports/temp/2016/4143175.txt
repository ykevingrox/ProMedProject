Tucuman Noticias [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.tucumanoticias.com.ar/noticia/salud/piden-ayuda-para-una-tucumana-internada-con-hantavirus-148843.html>A 23-year-old woman from Tucuman [province] was admitted to the Itialano Hospital emergency unit in Buenos Aires some days ago with a diagnosis of [a] hantavirus [infection].Her family members and friends have asked for the help of 80 blood donors. To respond to this request, they can go to any of this hospital's locations in the Federal Capital [instructions for donors are given]. The woman lives in Yerba Buena with her family.Hantaviruses constitute a genus that groups several RNA viruses that are transmitted by infected rodents. In humans, they can produce 2 types of infections: hemorrhagic fever and serious [cardiopulmonary syndrome, HPS].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the environmental conditions under which the woman acquired her infection are not given, nor whether there will be an epidemiological investigation of the area where she worked and resided, Yerba Buena department includes the eastern slopes of the Andes mountains and foothills. Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not stated, given its geographic location and proximity to the mountains, it is likely to be Andes virus. This virus is endemic in western Argentina, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there sporadically.Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. No mention is made of the involvement of her family members. Her infection may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta.ProMED would be interested in receiving information about the environment where the woman worked and lived, her current condition, and whether additional cases have occurred in the general Yerba Buena area.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Yerba Buena is the capital of the Yerba Buena Department in the province of TucumÌÁn, Argentina, and a map showing its locality can be accessed at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_Buena,_TucumÌÁn> and a geographic relief map at <http://www.maplandia.com/argentina/tucuman/capital/san-miguel-de-tucuman/>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4>.]
