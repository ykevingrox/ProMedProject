In mid-2015 and early 2016 there were 2 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Omani nationals hospitalized in Thailand shortly after arrival from Oman (see prior ProMED-mail postings below), suggesting that sporadic transmission was occurring in Oman.According to the 4 Nov 2016 Communicable Disease Threats Report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, as of 4 Nov 2016 there had been a total of 1845 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 704 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 38.2 per cent) reported by countries worldwide. With the addition of this newly confirmed case in Oman, and the 18 cases and 2 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia since 4 Nov 2016, the global tally is 1864 cases, including 706 deaths.Information on the epidemiologic investigation results on this newly confirmed case would be greatly appreciated. We would particularly like to know of possible high risk exposures of this individual in the 14 days preceding the onset of illness.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Oman can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25917>. - Mod.MPP]
