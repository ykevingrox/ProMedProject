Food Poisoning Bulletin [edited]<https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2016/good-vibe-tribe-luau-salmonella-cases-increase-to-15/>The salmonellosis outbreak associated with the 3 Jul 2016 Good Vibe Tribe Luau and recalled Kapowsin Meats pork has now sickened at least 15 people in Washington State. Seattle and King County state that traceback information about the pork came from Kapowsin Meats, which was involved in a large salmonellosis outbreak in 2015.As of 21 Jul 2016, 4 people were confirmed ill with salmonellosis with the same pulsed field-gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genetic fingerprint as the outbreak strain. Another 4 patients have been confirmed with salmonellosis, but the PFGE pattern testing is pending and 7 people have symptoms that are consistent with a salmonellosis, but no testing has been done.Since salmonellosis usually manifests a few days after exposure to the bacterium, if anyone was at that Luau and ate the pork and has not gotten sick, they probably won't. But there may still be ill persons out there who have not gone to a doctor.Food for the Luau was catered by Mojito, a Seattle establishment. Inspectors went to that facility on 13 Jul 2016 to inquire about food sources and preparation methods. There is no word on the results of those inspections.[Byline: Linda Larsen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2] USDADate: Thu 21 Jul 2016Source: Food Safety & Inspection Service [edited] <http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2016/recall-062-2016-release>Kapowsin Meats Inc., a Graham, Wash. establishment, is recalling approximately 11 658 pounds of pork products that may be contaminated with Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:-, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 21 Jul 2016..The whole roaster hogs were produced between 13 Jun 2016 and 15 Jul 2016. The following products are subject to recall: - Varying weights of boxed/bagged Whole Hogs for BarbequeThe products subject to recall bear establishment number ""EST. 1628M"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to various individuals, retail locations, institutions, and distributors in Washington.FSIS was notified of an illness investigation in Washington on 13 Jul 2016. The Washington State Department of Health updated FSIS on 19 Jul 2016 of confirmed case-patients involved in an illness outbreak of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:-. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health, local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FSIS determined that there is a highly probable link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological investigation, 3 _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- case-patients have been identified with illness onset dates ranging from 5 to 7 Jul 2016. Traceback investigation indicated that 3 case-patients consumed whole hog roasters for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats. At this time, it is not known if this outbreak strain has any drug resistance; results are pending.This investigation is ongoing. FSIS continues to work with public health partners at the Washington State Department of Health, local health and the CDC on this investigation.FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at <www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls>.FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145รฅยก deg F (63 deg C) with a 3 minute rest time. The only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, <http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ>. For whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in numerous places, including near the bone. Check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. Remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 1-2 hours.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report underscores that swine can be a significant reservoir for salmonellosis and that restaurants can cross-contaminate meats. The same serotype was responsible for the 2015 outbreak centered in Washington with 182 confirmed cases.The outbreak strain is _Salmonella_ I, 4, 5, 12:i: -, a designation discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control) <http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf>:_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:- the ""I"" reflects subspecies _enterica_;- the ""4, 12"" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>.]
