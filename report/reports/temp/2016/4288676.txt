16 WAPT News [edited]<http://www.wapt.com/news/central-mississippi/prison-botulism-outbreak-linked-to-homemade-alcohol/40033382>Mississippi health officials have confirmed that 17 inmates at the federal prison in Yazoo City have been treated for botulism. At least 1 of the prisoners is in critical condition, authorities said.The outbreak has been linked to a homemade alcoholic drink that was brewed inside the prison and consumed, authorities said. According to 16 WAPT News sources, an inmate said the drink involved orange juice, a tomato paste can, ketchup, and bread that was used as a filter.An anti-toxin has been administered to the sick inmates, authorities said.The CDC has been called in to investigate.[Byline: Scott Simmons]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[One form of prison-brewed alcohol is pruno. Pruno, or prison wine, (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruno>) is an alcoholic liquid variously made from apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, ketchup, sugar, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Bread provides the yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons and jails, where it can be produced cheaply, easily, and discreetly. The concoction can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been colorfully described as a ""vomit-flavored wine-cooler,"" although flavor is often not the primary objective. Depending on the time spent fermenting, the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2 percent (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14 percent (equivalent to a strong wine).The following is from Vugia DJ, Mase SR, Cole B, et al: Botulism from drinking pruno. Emerg Infect Dis 2009; 15(1): 69-71; <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660710/> and describes 2 outbreaks of this in California prisons, one of which was covered by ProMED-mail in 2004 (Botulism, prison brew - USA (CA) 20040806.2155):""In our investigations, the potatoes used in the pruno could have been the source of botulinum toxin. _Clostridium botulinum_ is commonly found in the soil, and its spores have been found on raw potatoes. Several outbreaks of botulism caused by eating potatoes have occurred in the United States, and laboratory studies have shown that _C. botulinum_ spores on the surface of raw potatoes can survive baking and lead to production of botulinum toxin. The warm anaerobic fermentation process of making pruno probably predisposes toward production of botulinum toxin, particularly if any ingredient happens to be contaminated with _C. botulinum_ or its spores, such as the potatoes used in these 2 instances.""Pruno is popular in prisons across the country, and it is somewhat surprising that botulism caused by pruno consumption has not been previously reported. This lack of reporting may be due to the fact that potatoes are not generally used in the making of pruno; recipes for making pruno and references to pruno found on the Internet do not mention potatoes as an ingredient. Occasional crackdowns on making pruno in some prisons could have driven some inmates to look for alternative ingredients, including potatoes. Nonetheless, with more than 2 million inmates in prisons and jails in the United States, this illicit homemade alcoholic drink may put more inmates at risk for botulism. Anecdotally, making pruno has been attempted outside prisons, possibly extending the potential risk for foodborne botulism carried by this novel vehicle beyond the prison walls. Risk for botulism from consuming pruno should be conveyed to inmates, prison staff, the medical community, and the general public. Any inmate with clinical botulism should be examined for an infected wound caused by drug injection and queried about recent drug use and drinking pruno."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53739>.]
