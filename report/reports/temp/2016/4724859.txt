We tested the effect of rVSV-ZEBOV in preventing Ebola virus disease [EVD] in contacts and contacts of contacts of recently confirmed cases in Guinea, West Africa.Interpretation--------------The results add weight to the interim assessment that rVSV-ZEBOV offers substantial protection against EVD, with no cases among vaccinated individuals from day 10 after vaccination in both randomised and non-randomised clusters.[The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was developed over a decade ago by the Public Health Agency of Canada and the United States Army and is now licensed to Merck. According to the New York Times (<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/health/ebola-vaccine.html>), the new vaccine has some flaws, experts said. It appears to work only against one of the 2 most common strains of the Ebola virus, and it may not give long-lasting protection. Some of those who get it report side effects like joint pain and headaches. An ideal vaccine would protect against all Ebola strains and Marburg. However, [Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for health systems and innovation] said, it may not be possible to make a shot effective against several strains if it is t based on the VSV spine because VSV triggers a lot of side effects.Risks that are acceptable in the midst of a deadly epidemic are not acceptable in a preventive vaccine given to healthy children and adults, several experts noted.The new vaccine is ""a step in the right direction but not the ultimate solution,"" said Dr Gary J Nabel, chief scientific officer for global health research at the Sanofi pharmaceutical company, who designed a different Ebola vaccine in the 1990s when he worked at the National Institutes of Health. ...A likely candidate for a routine Ebola vaccine is one now being developed by GSK, Dr Nabel said. It uses 2 shots: the 1st has the Ebola surface protein attached to a chimpanzee adenovirus that can infect humans without harming them; the 2nd uses a weakened pox virus similar to that used in smallpox vaccine. ...more. - Mod.LK]******[2] Research19 Dec 2016: Rapid visual screening and programmable subtype classification of Ebola virus biomarkers<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.201600739/abstract>Ref: Balcioglu M, Rana M, Hizir MS, et al: Rapid visual screening and programmable subtype classification of Ebola virus biomarkers. Adv Healthc Mater. 2016. doi: 10.1002/adhm.201600739.Abstract--------The massive outbreaks of the highly transmissible and lethal Ebola virus disease [EVD] were caused by infection with one of the _Ebolavirus_ species. It is vital to develop cost-effective, highly sensitive and selective multitarget biosensing platforms that allow for both the detection and phenotyping. Here, a highly programmable, cost-efficient and multianalyte sensing approach is reported that enables visual detection and differentiation of conserved oligonucleotide regions of all _Ebolavirus_ subtypes known to infect human primates. This approach enables the detection of as little as 400 amols (24x10^6 molecules) of target sequences with the naked eye. Furthermore, the detection assay can be used to classify 4 virus biomarkers using a single nanoprobe template. This can be achieved by using different combinations of short single stranded initiator molecules, referred to as programming units, which also enable the simultaneous and rapid identification of the four biomarkers in 16 different combinations. The results of 16x5 array studies illustrate that the system is extremely selective with no false-positive or false-negative. Finally, the target strands in liquid biopsy mimics prepared from urine specimens are also able to be identified and classified.20 Dec 2016: Researchers wage war against viral outbreaks <http://www.rdmag.com/article/2016/12/researchers-wage-war-against-viral-outbreaks>[A new method has emerged in understanding and possibly preventing the outbreak of viruses including HIV, SARS, Ebola, H1N1 and Zika.Researchers from Arizona State University have developed a method using a combination of proven complex sociological and statistical mathematic models to tell where a viral outbreak might occur, how it might spread and how it could be rolled back or even eliminated.]Ref: Castillo-Chavez C, Bichara D, Morin BR: Perspectives on the role of mobility, behavior, and time scales in the spread of diseases. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2016; 113(51): 14582-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1604994113Abstract--------The dynamics, control, and evolution of communicable and vector-borne diseases are intimately connected to the joint dynamics of epidemiological, behavioral, and mobility processes that operate across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The identification of a theoretical explanatory framework that accounts for the pattern regularity exhibited by a large number of host-parasite systems, including those sustained by host-vector epidemiological dynamics, is but one of the challenges facing the coevolving fields of computational, evolutionary, and theoretical epidemiology. Host-parasite epidemiological patterns, including epidemic outbreaks and endemic recurrent dynamics, are characteristic to well-identified regions of the world; the result of processes and constraints such as strain competition, host and vector mobility, and population structure operating over multiple scales in response to recurrent disturbances (like El NiÌ±o) and climatological and environmental perturbations over thousands of years. It is therefore important to identify and quantify the processes responsible for observed epidemiological macroscopic patterns: the result of individual interactions in changing social and ecological landscapes. In this perspective, we touch on some of the issues calling for the identification of an encompassing theoretical explanatory framework by identifying some of the limitations of existing theory, in the context of particular epidemiological systems. Fostering the reenergizing of research that aims at disentangling the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics, better understood as complex adaptive systems, is a key aim of this perspective.21 Dec 2016: Uveitis common among Ebola survivors<https://www.aao.org/editors-choice/uveitis-common-among-ebola-survivors>[A team of physicians from Emory University School of Medicine evaluated Ebola virus survivors at a hospital in Liberia and found the prevalence of uveitis was 22 percent, comparable to a previous series from a clinic in Sierra Leone that reported a rate between 18 percent and 34 percent.The high risk of a potentially blinding disease in [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] survivors underscores the importance of ophthalmic screening and treatment in this population. In addition, this study shows that more work needs to be done to determine the appropriate treatment for Ebola-associated uveitis, as well as the appropriate protective equipment for caregivers and family members.][Uveitis is a form of eye inflammation that generally affects the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea). But eye disease is not limited to the uvea. These diseases also affect the lens, retina, optic nerve, and vitreous, producing reduced vision or blindness. It may slightly reduce vision or can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. - Mod.LK]******[3] Non-governmental organization: World Health Organization20 Dec 2016: World Health Organization rethinks its response to disease outbreaks <http://www.nature.com/news/world-health-organization-rethinks-its-response-to-disease-outbreaks-1.21134>[3 years after the start of the world's worst [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] epidemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has created a program to improve its response to disease outbreaks and to prevent another such calamity.In June [2016], WHO director-general Margaret Chan named medical epidemiologist Peter Salama to lead a new health-emergencies program intended to streamline the agency's response to crises. As part of that program, the WHO has launched the Emerging Diseases Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN) to provide guidance on how to care for people during disease outbreaks.Global-health experts say that the changes are a step in the right direction, but both developing and wealthy nations must do much more to avert another devastating epidemic. Some are also concerned the WHO program will have trouble getting the funding it needs to succeed because of a lack of monetary support from member nations.""African countries are still so dependent on international and global outfits that the return of Ebola or any other disease will be another dÌ©jÌÊ vu of national unpreparedness,"" says virologist Oyewale Tomori at Redeemer's University in Ede, Nigeria. Tomori also said many developing nations still do not have sufficient capacity for recognizing and responding to an emerging infectious disease. ...more]******[4] Media26 Dec 2016: Ebola documentary featuring Kent Brantly will revisit outbreak<http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article122750889.html>Dr Kent Brantly's harrowing bout with the Ebola virus will be told again as part of a documentary showing in theaters across the country on [30 Mar 2017].
