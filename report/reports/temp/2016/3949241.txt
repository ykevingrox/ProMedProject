She visited Mpanga forest Reserve on 9 Dec 2015, Entebbe botanical garden and zoo on 17 Dec 2015, Murtchinson Falls and Rhino sanctuary on 22-24 Dec 2015 and Jinja (where she went horse riding) on 28-30 Dec 2015. The rest of the time, she was in Kampala.After the trip to Jinja, she noticed a big bite on her back, a bit painful and itchy. She reported seeing tsetse flies in Murtchinson Falls but also in Jinja. On 4 Jan 2016, she started having generalized weakness and balance problems, even fell over and hit her right eye with her glasses (she has a bruise). She also felt a bit congested in her upper respiratory airways and sinuses. Physical examination and a CBC were normal. She was diagnosed with possible mild labyrinthitis and prescribed nasal drops and spray and cinnarizine.She came back 2 days later with worsening weakness and balance problems, having problems with fine movements, shaking/trembling, febrile, with vague body pains, no dysphagia or diplopia. At examination, she appeared weak, fragile, unable to stand alone, (no vertigo), no nystagmus, normal pupils, coated tongue, chest clear, abdomen soft, index nose test showing bilateral dysmetria, BP 102/64, HR 98, SO2 98 per cent in air, temperature was 37.9 C [102 F], a big hot swelling on her right upper back with an ecchymotic area but no eschar.Laboratory investigations showed raised inflammatory markers but normal-low leucocytes, decreased hemoglobin, significant thrombocytopenia, raised liver enzymes, and borderline kidney function. In the suspect of a rickettsial fever, she was started on doxycycline, IV fluids and Stemetil [prochlorperazine] were also given. On 10 Jan 2016, the clinical symptoms were slightly better, especially the dysmetria and balance, but laboratory tests showed increasing inflammatory markers, decreasing hemoglobin, and increasing bilirubin and creatinine.On 11 Jan 2016, tender hepatomegaly appeared and a right pleural effusion was noted (confirmed echographically). The laboratory tests showed the presence of trypanosomes on the slide (15-20/field), confirming the diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis. History and the clinical features seem to suggest _T. rhodesiensis_. Lumbar puncture was unremarkable, and the patient was transferred to Nairobi for treatment with Suramin and is reportedly improving.--Dr Monica ImiSpecialist in Internal MedicineThe Surgery UgandaMichael Libman MDJ D MacLean Centre for Tropical Diseases (Director)Division of Infectious DiseasesDepartment of MicrobiologyMcGill University Health Centre - Glen CampusRoom E05.18301001 Boul.

Thus, there is a small risk to tourists. Control relies on supressing the vector, the Tse Tse fly, and changing risks to humans probably reflects changing distribution of the vector or cattle. ProMED-mail would welcome an update on the distribution of trypanosomiasis in Uganda from the national authorities. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>.][See Also:2009---Trypanosomiasis - Uganda (02): distribution: 20091217.4272Trypanosomiasis - Poland ex Uganda (Queen Elizabeth NP) 20090810.2844Trypanosomiasis - Uganda: (DO) 20090315.10572008---Trypanosomiasis - Uganda (02): animal reservoir 20080512.1611Trypanosomiasis - Uganda: animal reservoir 20080511.1604Trypanosomiasis, bovine - Uganda (Tororo) 20080410.13162005---Trypanosomiasis - Uganda (Kaberamaido) 20050127.02942003---Trypanosomiasis, vector increase - Uganda (02) 20030506.1132Trypanosomiasis, vector increase - Uganda 20030301.0514].................................................ep/msp/sh"
