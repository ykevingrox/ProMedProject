7WDAM [edited]<http://www.wdam.com/story/32375643/msdh-confirms-vibrio-case-in-hancock-co>An official with the Mississippi State Department of Health just confirmed a Hancock County resident is being treated for _Vibrio vulnificus_. This is the 1st confirmed case of the bacteria in Mississippi this year. Over the years, the University of Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast Research Lab has learned a lot about this bacterium that causes both foodborne and wound-related illnesses.Officials confirm they are seeing the number of _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections as the waters warm. In this case, it is unclear where, when and how the bacterium was contracted, according to the health department. The bacterium is always present in the Gulf waters, and thrives during the warmest months of the year. The organisms generally enter a person's body through open wounds, but you can also contract it by inhaling water or eating raw oysters. Most cases are from people with cuts or open wounds, so those people should avoid the water. Those with a compromised immune system are also at a higher risk of serious complications.On Mon, 4 Jul 2016, we told you about a Louisiana man who is battling a bacterial infection he may have picked up from the water near Bay St. Louis. His right leg was amputated last week, according to family members, but the health department has not confirmed this as a _Vibrio_ case. The man's family members said he was doing much better. They called his recovery ""a miracle"". Medical professionals stress that if you start feeling bad and are running a fever shortly after exposure to saltwater, get to a doctor or the emergency room immediately. Symptoms, like chills, fever, sores, blisters or swelling usually appear in the first 24 hours after contact. Treatment includes receiving antimicrobials and fluids.--Communicated by:ProMED-MENA from HealthMap Alerts<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[The manifestations of _V. vulnificus_ in the Mississippi case are not stated.The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.""The 'primary septicemia' form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. It is not clear that the woman in this post had any well defined risk factors. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/226>.]
