Act Media, Romanian News Agency [edited]<http://actmedia.eu/daily/the-minister-of-agriculture-the-e-coli-bacteria-was-discovered-in-dairy-products-in-arges/62542>The bacterium _Escherichia coli_ was discovered in dairy products in Arges County especially in cottage cheese produced by 'Lactate Bradet' stated on [Mon 29 Feb 2016], by the minister of agriculture Achim Irimescu.At the same time, the National Veterinary Authority for Food Safety (ANSVSA) sent a press release by which they said that on 25 Feb 2016 joint teams made up of inspectors from Arges and Dolj started the action of taking samples which were sent to be analyzed to the Institute for Public Health (IISPV). According to the results of the inquiry, in which 194 samples analyzed up to that date, _E. coli_ O26 was found in a chicken sample taken from the refrigerator of one of the persons under inquiry. The meat came from chickens raised in the household of the respective person (Bacau county). At the same time, the bacterium also was discovered in samples taken from 25 kg [55 lb] of cottage cheese produced by a dairy unit in Arges (Lactate Bradet).At present, in Marie Curie Hospital in Bucharest there are 5 children hospitalized, with hemolytic uremic syndrome due to _E. coli_. Out of these, one is in serious condition in intensive care, after neurological problems have appeared 'which cannot be stopped' said on [Mon 29 Feb 2016] Dr Mihaela Balgradean, the head of the Nephrology department in Marie Curie Hospital.The number of children hospitalized with diarrhea in Arges County on [Mon 29 Feb 2016] reached 51, 43 of whom are younger than 2 years old, Arges Prefecture reports. The Paediatric Hospital of the county seat Pitesti has 42 of them, 35 of whom are younger than 2 years old, while the Emergency County Hospital of Pitesti has 3 infants, all younger than 2 years old. 3 infants younger than 2 years old each are at the pediatric wards of the Campulung Muscel Municipal Hospital and the Curtea de Arges Municipal Hospital. One day previously, the number of children with diarrhea hospitalized in Arges County was 45.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The relationship of the serotype O26 in the chicken sample and the cottage cheese is not clear. Of note, chicken, and fowl in general, are not common sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_.In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups of EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_], it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from the prototypic O157 strain (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (3), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.Clinically, the O157 infections can have a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. 5 (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce HUS, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (4).Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.References----------1.
