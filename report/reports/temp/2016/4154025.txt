Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/romania-e-coli-outbreak-update-two-dozen-affected-linked-to-milk-products-13134/>In a follow-up to the _E. coli_ outbreak in Romania, European health officials report 25 overall Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli or EHEC - Mod.LL], 24 in Romania and one in Italy, which includes 19 hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and 3 fatalities. The outbreak, which started 2 months ago, has primarily affected children (22), ages 5 to 38 months.This is an outbreak of EHEC O26 confirmed through serology. The epidemiological investigation suggests a single source. Following initial environmental investigations, _E. coli_ O26 was identified in soft cheese samples produced by a local company that sells traditional dairy items in Arges district, Romania.The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) announced a voluntary recall of different milk-based food products from the Romanian company SC BRADET. The implicated milk processing establishment exported a particular type of cheese to 4 EU countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and one Italian importer further distributed this product to France and Germany.The last Romanian case associated with this outbreak had onset of symptoms on 14 Mar 2016. The cheese consumed by the Italian case was imported in Italy from Romania on 1 Mar 2016 and had been produced on 18 Feb 2016 with an expiry date of 18 Apr 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The development of HUS in the outbreak is higher than usual, as is the case fatality rate. It would be interesting to know how many of the children had received antimicrobials early in the illness, which is a clear risk factor for the development of HUS. - Mod.LLMaps of Romania can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/51952>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
