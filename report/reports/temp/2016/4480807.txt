He was killed there by US forces in 2011.Despite the attacks, Pakistan hopes to be removed from the list of polio-endemic countries by 2018 by achieving its goal of no fresh cases for a year. It is one of only 2 countries in the world where polio, a crippling childhood disease, remains endemic. [Given the identified circulation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in northern Nigeria ongoing silently since 2011, in a locale also associated with violence directed against polio workers and false rumors of western plots against Nigerian children mediated through vaccinations, one wonders whether Nigeria will maintain its status as ""non-endemic,"" as the circulation has gone on undetected in Borno state for 5 years; see prior ProMED posts on the recent WPV1 cases identified in Borno state. - Mod.MPP].In April [2016] gunmen shot dead 7 policemen guarding a polio vaccination team in Karachi.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Violence against polio workers is both frightening as well as reprehensible, as they are doing admirable work, trying to save future generations of children from poliovirus associated paralytic disease. As a public health worker, it is hard to understand how this continues to happen, other than that the general population in these areas lives under a state of fear of retaliation should they attempt to organize against these groups.Peshawar is the capital of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province and is located near the Khyber Pass (a key route to Afghanistan) as well as the FATA, Federally Administered Tribal Areas region, (see map of provinces available at: <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/maps/pakistan-political-map.jpg>).

Pakistan is among 3 countries in the world where polio is still endemic.An environmental sample taken from the Samanabad area has tested positive for polio virus. The sample had been taken from a sewage drain in a drive carried out in August [2016]. It is the 6th sample that has tested positive for the virus in the province this year [2016]. Two samples each have tested positive in Rawalpindi and Faisalabad and one in Dera Ghazi Khan.At a meeting held on Saturday [10 Sep 2016] to review the polio immunisation strategy in view of the latest finding, the authorities concerned decided to pay special attention to mobile population groups in Lahore and Rawalpindi in the upcoming drive in the last week of September [2016]. The meeting was chaired by Emergency Operation Centre Coordinator Dr Munir Ahmed.Talking to The Express Tribune, Health Department spokesman Akhlaq Ali Khan said an alert had been issued to the staff across the province. He said the next campaign would be more rigorous than the earlier ones this year [2016]. He said the detection of the virus suggested that more efforts were needed to reach children missed out in earlier drives. However, he added that successive immunisation campaigns held recently should ensure that there wouldn't be a lot of damage from the virus. ""There are no reported cases of polio so far. This shows that a high level of immunity against the disease has developed among the population. The circulating virus seems to be a low grade one,"" he said. ""The report shows that the sample is not indigenous. Perhaps it has been brought to the city by those migrating and settling here from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa or Afghanistan,"" he said.Lady Health Workers' Association Lahore president Naureen Rizvi said that detection of virus showed that a large number of children were still out of reach. She said the drain from where the sample had been collected passed through several densely populated neighbourhoods along Multan Road and in Babu Sabu and Sabzazar areas. ""We must improve our campaign in these areas,"" she said. Rizvi said the health workers had not faced any threats in earlier campaigns in these areas.Separately, Advisor to Chief Minister on Health Khwaja Salman Rafiq directed the staff concerned in Rawalpindi and Lahore to make extra efforts in the upcoming immunisation drives. He said samples collected from the drain had tested positive at the National Institute of Health laboratory. He said there was an urgent need to improve immunisation efforts.No polio case has been reported in the province this year [2016]. Pakistan is among 3 countries in the world where polio is still endemic. Nigeria and Afghanistan are the other 2 countries.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Wikipedia describes Samanabad as ""a major residential area and administrative subdivision of Lahore, Pakistan. It is the oldest posh area of Lahore and located in the center of city. It houses about 250 000 people. Lahore's largest market of secondhand/used cars is also in Samanabad. Most of the residential units in the area were built in the 1960-1970s. This area is known for lush green playgrounds, abundant trees and privately maintained green beds."" (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samanabad>).Another media report from the Business Reporter carried on HealthMap alerts from 9 Sep 2016 mentions the locale as Sabzazar, a subdivision of the Samanabad area in Lahore, and mentioned that a wild poliovirus type 1 was isolated but, ""it is too early to tell from where the virus had originated as the genetic sequencing of the collected sample has yet to take place and will take some time... It may be added that some of the people living in the area of Sabzazar are migrants.""

Regional outbreak response across northeastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad sub-region is continuing within the broader humanitarian emergency context. Detection of new cases at this point is not unexpected or unusual, particularly as surveillance is being strengthened (including by conducting retrospective acute flaccid paralysis case searches).- The polio outbreak has been declared a national public health emergency by the Government of Nigeria and a regional public health emergency by the Governments of the Lake Chad sub-region, to ensure all-of-government, all-of-society approaches to the outbreak response.- The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has launched an emergency appeal to respond to the polio outbreak across the region. Against the planned outbreak response budget of USD 116 million, a critical funding gap of USD 33 million must be urgently filled.Afghanistan- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [8 Aug 2016], from Kabul. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 8.- No WPV1 environmental positive samples have been reported in 2016. The most recent environmental positive samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] - one in Jalalabad district of Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) were successfully implemented in August [2016], with further campaigns scheduled for early October [2016] and early November [2016].Pakistan- One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the past week, from South Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), with onset of paralysis on [27 Jul 2016]. It is the most recent case in the country, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 14.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.- An Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) took place from [15-19 Aug 2016], reporting progress whilst emphasizing the work that needs to be done to remove the remaining subnational gaps in surveillance.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type one (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3 in 2016 and 8 in 2015.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.- An Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) took place from [15-19 Aug 2016], reporting progress whilst emphasizing the work that needs to be done to remove the subnational gaps in surveillance that remain.Madagascar- One year has passed since the most recent circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type one (cVDPV1) case, which had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015], from Sud-Ouest region. No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been reported in 2016. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 is 10.- The 3rd Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) in Madagascar found that circulation of cVDPV1 had probably been interrupted, however further improvements in surveillance in high-risk areas were needed for a definitive assessment.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for [9-11 Nov 2016] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). Myanmar- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type two (cVDPV2) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case was isolated from a 16-month old child in Maungdaw district of Rakhine state, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 is 2.Nigeria- One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the past week, from Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno state, with onset of paralysis on [6 Aug 2016]. It is the most recent case in country and brings the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 3.- Detection of new cases at this point is not unexpected or unusual, particularly as surveillance is being strengthened (including by conducting retrospective acute flaccid paralysis case searches).- A full case investigation of the 3rd case is ongoing, however the child had onset of paralysis on [6 Aug 2016] and was detected in an accessible internally-displaced persons camp in Monguno LGA. The child's family had originally arrived from Marte LGA (as had the family of the case from Jere LGA reported in August [2016]).- An emergency regional outbreak response is continuing under the guidance of the Emergency Operations Committee, led by the Government of Nigeria and with support from WHO and GPEI partners, including with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). The outbreak response is being coordinated with neighbouring countries and in the broader humanitarian emergency response context affecting the region. Similar approaches to outbreak response were successfully implemented in previous years in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.Lake Chad sub-region- The recent detection of WPV1 in Borno state, Nigeria, poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad sub-region, and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Health leaders at last month's [August 2016] Regional Committee for Africa declared the situation to be a regional public health emergency for the Lake Chad sub-region.West Africa- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district, with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is 7. The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset in August 2014.- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from [30 Sep 2016 - 3 Oct 2016]; and in Niger, Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) will start on [17 Sep 2016]. NIDs are also planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from [28-31 Oct 2016]. SNIDs are planned in Mauritania from [28-31 Oct 2016], and in Niger starting on [9 Oct 2016] with a subsequent round on [28-31 Oct 2016].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As of 7 Sep 2016, there have been a total of 25 cases of WPV associated polio reported worldwide, compared with 39 cases reported in the same period last year (2015). Cases of WPV associated disease have been reported from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria only during 2016. Only Laos has reported cases of cVDPV during 2016, with the last cases reported in January 2016, associated with an outbreak that began in 2015. But, a concern is (or should be) -- following the identification of 3 cases of WPV1 associated disease in Nigeria after 2 years of no cases identified, and the virus genetically related to a strain that had been circulating in the affected state (Borno) in 2011 -- that there are other areas of the world (including Pakistan and Afghanistan) where there is ongoing civil unrest, and vaccination activities have been sub-optimal due to the civil unrest, and may well have similar ""silent transmission"" of WPV not being detected at present.New information on the cases in Borno state Nigeria includes the mention that 2 of the 3 cases had come to the displaced person's camp from the same LGA - Marte, which is located on the western coast of Lake Chad (see <http://thenigeriangazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BORNO-STATE-MAP.gif> for a map of Borno state). According to media reports, as of August 2016, Marte LGA in Borno state was still under Boko Haram control (<http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/general/relocate-to-idp-camps-borno-orders-council-chairmen/160543.html>), suggestive of continued difficulties in access for vaccination activities.Reading through today's [8 Sep 2016] update with media reports of violence in Pakistan against a lead physician of the FATA vaccination activities and the continued presence of civil unrest in Borno state Nigeria, which also interferes with vaccination activities, it raises serious concerns regarding the realities on the ground with respect to polio eradication efforts in these areas of civil unrest. It's unfortunate that things have changed since polio eradication efforts began back in the 1980s, when both sides of civil unrest activities in Latin America would agree to a cease fire so that vaccination activities could continue to better the lives of the children living in the affected zones. In today's world, children are being held hostage (both literally and figuratively) in areas of civil unrest.Maps showing the distribution of poliovirus isolates (WPV, and cVDPV) can be found at: <http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx>. - Mod.MPP]
