BioBio Chile [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/nacional/region-del-bio-bio/2016/07/21/confirman-nuevo-caso-de-virus-hanta-en-la-region-del-bio-bio-3.shtml>This Thursday morning [21 Jul 2016], a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was confirmed in the Bio Bio region. The affected individual is a 7-year-old boy who is currently attended in the Sanatorio Aleman in ConcepciÌ n. The boy is in critical condition in a coma with mechanical ventilation.The child, together with his family, traveled from Santiago to the Laja rural area community to visit family members. Presumably, he became infected in this place.He was hospitalized in Laja and later taken to Los Angeles. After 5 days without a diagnosis, he arrived at the Sanatorio AlemÌÁn, where [a] hantavirus was detected. The physician who is head of the pediatric critical care unit of the Sanatorio AlemÌÁn in ConcepciÌ n, RaÌ¼l BÌ¼stos, confirmed the diagnosis and mentioned that additionally the boy has respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] which further complicates the situation.The boy was taken to a special unit in the ConcepciÌ n Regional Hospital that offers better conditions to be able to handle the disease.[Published by Claudia MiÌ±o, information from Oscar Valenzuela]--Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The boy is indeed unfortunate in having co-infections by a hantavirus leading to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and RSV. As we have commented before, Andes hantavirus is endemic in Chile and cases of infection are reported every year in the BÌ o BÌ o region. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus infection, some with pulmonary syndrome, occur every year and apparently this is the 9th case in the region this year (2016). Infections are acquired when people are exposed to virus-containing excreta from infected rodents. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be accessed at <http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/chilfung/chile_regions.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/36633>. - Mod.TY]
