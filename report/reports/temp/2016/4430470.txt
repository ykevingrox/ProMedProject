The Sentinel [summ., edited]<http://www.sentinelassam.com/ghy_city/story.php?sec=2&subsec=4&id=278206&dtP=2016-08-19&ppr=1>Japanese encephalitis [JE] and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) have claimed as many as 173 lives [in Assam state] this year till 17 Aug [2016].Of the 173 cases of death, 78 deaths have been confirmed due to Japanese encephalitis, state Health Department sources said.Sources pointed out as many as 1511 cases of AES have been detected, of which 360 cases have been confirmed as JE.Sources further said that these are conservative statistics and the cases are likely to increase.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of fatalities in Assam have increased from 66 as of 2 Aug 2016 to the fatal 78 cases given above. As mentioned in the previous post, Assam is in the midst of its usual JE virus transmission season. JE virus is endemic in northeastern India and more cases can be expected over the remainder of the transmission season. It seems odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination either in the recent past or plans for a campaign, given the concern about a resurgence in vector populations and JE cases, as floodwaters receded earlier in the month.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299>. - Mod.TY]
