The Slovak Spectator [edited]<http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20179834/number-of-people-infected-with-tick-borne-encephalitis-rises.html>The number of people suffering from tick-borne encephalitis in KoÁice increased again on 1 Jun [2016]. So far 27 infected patients have been hospitalised at the Infectology and Travel Medicine Department (KICM) of the Louis Pasteur University Hospital (UNLP) while another 5 are being monitored by doctors at outpatient departments.""This number is not necessarily definitive, as the incubation period of the disease (between 7-14 days - ed. note) has not expired yet,"" said Ladislava ÊustovÌÁ, the hospital's spokesperson, as cited by the SITA newswire.Some patients have been released from the hospital already while doctors have not recorded any complications in treatment so far.Local tick-borne encephalitis broke out in KoÁice last weekend [28-29 May 2016]. Consumption of cheese produced from unpasteurized sheep's milk is said to have caused the infection.Symptoms of this infectious viral disease come in 2 stages:""The 1st presents as a mild flu, including a loss of appetite and intestinal problems,"" explained ÊustovÌÁ. ""After 3 or 4 days these problems fade and the so-called asymptomatic phase occurs, which can last up to 20 days. Then a 2nd phase sets in abruptly, featuring high fever, persistent headaches, vomiting, sensitivity to light, a stiff neck, and other symptoms characteristic of the involvement of the central nervous system.""One of the most serious complications of the disease is meningitis.KICM records 6 cases of tick-borne encephalitis on average per year.""Such a mass outbreak of tick-borne encephalitis has not been recorded at this hospital for the past 5 years,"" said ÊustovÌÁ.In total, Slovak doctors diagnosed 88 cases of tick-borne encephalitis in Slovakia last year [2015], 17 of which were found to be contracted via food. So far this year [2016], except for the local epidemic in KoÁice, 8 people have contracted the disease, none of them via food, Martina MerkovÌÁ from the Public Health Authority (Ì VZ) told the TASR newswire.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus and cases occur yearly there. Although castor bean ticks, _Ixodes ricinus_, are the main vectors that transmit TBE virus to people, individuals can become infected by consumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products coming from infected animals -- goats in the situation above. Presumably, the public will be warned of this risk and advised of measures to avoid tick bites and be vaccinated as people become more active out of doors with the onset of warmer weather.The Standing Commission on Vaccination Recommendations at the Robert Koch Institute recommends vaccination against TBE for people who live or work in areas at risk of TBE and who are at risk of tick bites, and for people in endemic areas for other reasons if they are at risk of tick exposure. - Mod.TYMaps of Slovakia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/europe/Slovakian-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53556>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
