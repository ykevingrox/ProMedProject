CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) News [edited]<http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/flu-yukon-early-season-70-cases-1.3868967>Flu season has arrived with a vengeance in Yukon, with more than 70 confirmed cases as of 24 Nov 2016. Yukon normally averages 5 cases of confirmed influenza by 1 December each year, according to Dr Catherine Elliott, the territory's deputy chief medical officer of health. Of the confirmed cases, 86 per cent have been in Whitehorse. Cases in 3 rural communities have made up the remaining 14 per cent.This surge of flu cases in Yukon is unusual, says Elliott. Most provinces and territories are reporting routine flu activity or no flu activity. Elliott says H3N2 is the strain of influenza being identified in the lab. It typically causes more severe illness.As of 21 Nov 2016, 8 people have required hospitalization . Yukon normally sees an average of 7 flu hospitalizations over the entire 52-week flu season.Dr Elliott is urging Yukoners to get flu shots, as this year's [2016-2017] vaccine protects against H3N2. If you think you have the flu, and you don't have any chronic conditions or risk factors for complications, Elliott advises staying home, and staying away from ""people who might be vulnerable, like the elderly, the very young, people who are pregnant. But if you are in one of those vulnerable categories, then you should seek medical care as soon as possible."" She also recommends washing your hands often and practising good coughing etiquette to keep viruses from spreading.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Canada can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/267>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Reunion: impact in intensive care unitsDate: Wed 24 Nov 2016Source: Eurosurveillance 2016; 21(47) [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22649>[ref: Filleul L, Ranoaritiana DB, Balleydier E, et al. A major impact of the influenza seasonal epidemic on intensive care units, Reunion, April to August 2016. Euro Surveill. 2016; 21(47): pii=30405]---------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------2016 seasonal influenza in Reunion in the southern hemisphere was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (possibly genogroup 6B.1). An estimated 100 500 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) consulted a physician (cumulative attack rate 11.9 per cent). 66 laboratory-confirmed cases (65.7/100 000 ARI consultations) were hospitalised in an intensive care unit, the highest number since 2009. Impact on intensive care units was major. Correlation between severe cases was 0.83 between Reunion and France and good for 2009 to 2015.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>The complete article is available at the source URL above.""Reunion is a southern hemisphere French overseas territory with 843 529 inhabitants (2015 estimate) located in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Mauritius. The island benefits from a healthcare system similar to mainland France. In the 2016 influenza season, lasting from April to August, Reunion experienced a high number of severe influenza cases.""The study reports that an incidence rate of severe cases over the whole season was 65.7 per 100 000 ARI consultations in 2016, higher (1.5 times) than that observed in 2014 (46.0/100 000). The study also reports mainly influenza B virus circulation at the beginning of the epidemic period, and that influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus became the predominantly circulating virus later. Some A(H3N2) viruses were also detected, which accounted for only 20 percent of influenza viruses identified through surveillance. The study explored some common risk factors for influenza, such as chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and cardiac disease, and did not observe any significant differences between previous seasons or type/subtype of viruses. There was low immunization coverage of around 34 percent in Reunion reported in the study.The authors conclude that: ""If a similar situation to that in Reunion happened during the 2016/17 influenza season in mainland France and potentially other European countries, we might observe an increase of severe influenza cases. This information can be useful to strengthen prevention, that is, by improving immunization coverage for the 2016/17 season and to prepare ICUs to be able to care for possibly more influenza patients than usual."" - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Reunion Island can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/531>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] WHO: global updateDate: Mon 28 Nov 2016Source: WHO Surveillance and monitoring, influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update - 277 (based on data up to 13 Nov 2016)--------------------------------------------------------SummaryInfluenza activity in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere has not yet picked up and remained at inter-seasonal levels. Influenza activity in temperate southern hemisphere countries was back at inter-seasonal levels.- In North America and Europe, influenza activity was still low with few influenza virus detections and influenza-like illness (ILI) levels below seasonal thresholds. In the United States, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity continued to be reported.- In East Asia, an increased level of influenza activity was reported in Southern China, influenza A(H3N2) remained the dominant virus circulating.- In Western Asia influenza detections remained low.- In the Caribbean countries, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low. In Central America, there was a slight increase in influenza virus activity but RSV continued to circulate in several countries as the predominant respiratory virus.- In tropical South America, respiratory virus activities remained low with exception of Colombia where RSV activity continued to be reported.- In tropical countries of South Asia, influenza virus detections remained low.- In South East Asia, influenza activity continued to be reported at low levels in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Vietnam with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating. In African region, influenza detections increased in Ghana with B viruses dominating.- In temperate South America, influenza and RSV activity continue to decrease throughout the sub-region.- In Oceania, influenza virus activity was at inter-seasonal levels.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 78 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 31 Oct 2016 to 13 Nov 2016 (data as of 25 Nov 2016 04:15:03 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 75 463 specimens during that time period. 3603 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 3248 (90.1 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 355 (9.9 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 63 (2.5 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2482 (97.5 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 34 (37 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 58 (63 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There is still fairly low influenza activity from most regions and countries despite it being the end of November; the relatively mild weather and delayed winter onset may be an underlying contributor. The frequency of influenza virus detection is approximately 5 per cent (positive samples/total tested) and mainly influenza A/H3N2 subtype has been detected. Some countries have reported RSV activity. - Mod.UBA]
