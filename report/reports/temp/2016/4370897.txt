The Herald, The Associated Press report [edited]<http://www.heraldonline.com/news/article91579082.html>Alaska health officials are investigating a number of salmonella infections in Bethel. KYUK-AM reports (<http://bit.ly/2a7UCF2>) that a team from the Alaska Division of Public Health is now in Bethel to find the source of 6 confirmed cases in the area in 2016.State epidemiologist Louisa Castrodale says 6 infections is a large number for a small area in such a short time. She says the infections may have come from contaminated food or from contact with a person who had salmonellosis. Salmonellosis can cause serious, sometimes fatal, infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy people can experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.More than 50 salmonella cases are confirmed in Alaska each year.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not clear if the isolates are the same serotype and if so, if they have identical genetic patterns to suggest a single source. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206>.]
