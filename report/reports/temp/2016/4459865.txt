[After an] outbreak of anthrax on [25 Jul 2016], quarantine measures were implemented in one of the areas, focus localization started and in the future, large-scale work in the aftermath of the deaths of animals, to prevent the spread of the disease among the indigenous population and the healthy livestock.This week, Dmitry Kobylkin informed government members about the actions taken and the results of the joint work. Today [31 Aug 2016], the lifting of quarantine messages were sent to the federal center.At present, the territory continues its rehabilitation activities. All tundra are traditional places of residence -- in the net of the tundra zone, where the settling of a new life in the nomad camps, where products and necessities, daily groceries, medical kits, and more have been imported. Saved and disinfected wooden products, including a sacred sledge, for many generations of these indigenous people have already been transferred to heads of families. Funds have been allocated and developed options for the acquisition of deer from the affected tundra.The nomad camps are preparing for the new school year. In the Yamal region, as well as in the Arctic tundra County, is collecting school children in boarding schools. Yarsalinskii boarding school, incidentally, is the largest in Russia, it is already taking children. The buildings are fully disinfected and meet the most stringent standards of sanitary inspections.Currently, the hospital in Salekhard has one child patient. According to doctors, the girl is healthy but will remain under supervision until the traces of wounds on the skin have healed. Her parents are waiting for discharge.As of the morning of [31 Aug 2016], according to the District, more than 14 000 people from risk groups had been vaccinated.Number of vaccinated animals is as follows: in the Yamal region, 180 352 head; in Taz, 94 424; in Priuralsky, 55 543; in Nadym, 6205; in Krasnoselkupsky, 1754; in Shuryshkarsky, 20,023; and in Purovsky area, 2486. In the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug a total of 354 346 head of reindeer have been vaccinated against anthrax.--communicated byMichael Owen<owenmp@seanet.com>******[2]Date: Thu 1 Sep 2016Source: Daily Star [edited]<http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/542538/Anthrax-disease-spread-blood-insects-sucking-deadly-zombie-anthrax-virus-death-Siberia>The killer disease [anthrax] has become ""dangerous"" in the Russian Arctic circle with blood-sucking insects carrying the [bacteria]. But now a warning has been issued that the threat is likely to spread to other areas of the region.Northern areas of Russia are normally frozen all year, but this year [2016] an unusually hot summer has melted frost and exposed infected soils.Last month [August 2016] Vladimir Putin ordered Russian biochemical warfare troops to destroy 2349 infected reindeer carcasses -- the 1st casualties of the spreading pathogen. The so-called ""zombie"" anthrax disease led to 25 people being infected, with the death of a 12 year old boy. The blood-sucking flies and mosquitoes have spread the killer-plague by up to 12 miles [19 km] away from the origin.The entire Yamal peninsula region in the Russian Arctic is thought to be a potential hotspot for the deadly illness. Hot summer weather melted more frost, revealing soil which harbours the disease. As more animals become infected, biting insects will catch the [pathogen] and continue to spread it.A report on the current crisis has exposed the looming crisis in Siberia. Leading researcher Dr Oleg Selyaninov said: ""The insects -- and we are mostly speaking about gadflies [horseflies] -- bite infected animals and transmit anthrax spores to another animal. In some cases it can even be corpse flies [blow flies] which transmit the spores from the carcasses of dead animals. A human can also contract anthrax this way, but this time we had no such cases.""Melting ice is thought to have been brought on by climate changes, and if the situation continues we can expect more [pathogens] to be unleashed on the planet.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Wed 31 Aug 2016Source: The Siberian Times [edited]<http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/features/f0253-deadly-anthrax-infection-spread-250-kilometres-in-15-days-due-to-mosquitoes/>Two more outbreaks of anthrax hit northern Siberia due to thawing permafrost. In each case the deadly decades-old 'zombie' disease originated in contaminated soil and was awakened by hot Arctic summer weather. A strong new warning from scientists suggests that there is a 'dangerous' risk of infection across this entire permafrost area.The Yamal-Nenets region has suffered not one but 3 separate outbreaks of lethal anthrax since [7 Jul 2016], with bloodsucking insects -- especially gadflies and mosquitoes -- playing a key role in the spread, we can confirm. A strong new warning from scientists suggests that there is a 'dangerous' risk of infection across this entire permafrost area. There was worldwide coverage last month [July 2016] when Russian bio- and chemical-warfare troops were deployed to deal with the 1st case of the infection since 1941.Now it is clear that there were a total of 2 outbreaks on the Yamal peninsula, and a 3rd east of the Gulf of Ob. Previously, only one focal point was acknowledged, around Lake Yarato.Now scientists say that the epicentre of this initial outbreak was in a privately-owned herd of reindeer at nearby Lake Pisyoto on [7 Jul 2016], while a 2nd outbreak occurred some 100 kilometres or 62 miles southeast at Novy Port, on the Gulf of Ob. The last, where the infection was detected on [3 Aug 2016], was at Pyakyakhinskaya in Tazovsky district, a distance of some 250 km or 155 miles east of the original infection.Officials say that the summer anthrax infections led to one fatality, a 12 year old boy, along with the death of 2349 reindeer and at least 4 dogs.The soil originally became infected because of numerous anthrax outbreaks, specifically in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Crucially, the study also established that the infection started in thawed, contaminated soil, rather than emanating directly from decades-old poisoned reindeer carcasses or even human remains in graveyards, as was earlier believed. This, in turn, means that controlling new outbreaks in a warming climate is virtually impossible, other than by mass vaccinations of people and animals.""Due to the wide spread of anthrax in the past, almost the entire territory of Yamal district is dangerous in terms of anthrax,"" said a report from the All-Russian Research Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, part of the Russian Agricultural Academy.Researchers established that especially around the initial outbreak bloodsucking insects were active in transmitting the disease from animal to animal over a distance of up to 20 km (12 miles). There had been no outbreak of anthrax in Yamal since 1941 before this summer's [2016] outbreak.Vaccination-----------Controlling new outbreaks in a warming climate is virtually impossible, other than by mass vaccinations of people and animals.Dr Oleg Selyaninov, leading researcher at the All-Russian Research Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, told us: ""We see at least 3 different foci -- the 1st near the Lake Pisyoto, next near Novy Port settlement, and the 3rd in Tazovsky district. The animals that contracted the disease near Pisyoto could not get to Novy Port, and then to Tazovsky district. There is no migration between these areas and these foci were activated almost simultaneously.""Researchers established that especially around the initial outbreak bloodsucking insects were active in transmitting the disease from animal to animal over a distance of up to 20 km (12 miles). ""The insects -- and we are mostly speaking about gadflies -- bite infected animals and transmit anthrax spores to another animal. In some cases it can even be corpse flies which transmit the spores from the carcasses of dead animals. A human can also contract anthrax this way, but this time we had no such cases. The insects spread the disease mostly around the first foci.""After the infection on [7 Jul 2016], over the next few days 3 animals a day died here, and [15 and 16 Jul 2016], the number reached 20 per day. Between [17 and 19 Jul 2016], the herders lost 200 deer and 4 dogs, yet it is believed that until this point the disease was contained in this area.Vaccinations of reindeer, begun in Soviet times, were halted in 2007, but now all animals are to be injected. 6 districts of Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region have 59 known burial sites of animals which died of anthrax in 1941 or during earlier decades.Military operation------------------The Russian defence ministry deployed biological and chemical warfare troops to destroying the infected carcasses of reindeer in this summer's [2016] outbreak.But not only these sites are dangerous, the report makes clear. A total of 97 people, including 50 children, were admitted to local hospitals in the wake of the anthrax outbreak. 2 dozen cases of infection in people were confirmed.Deputy prime minister Olga Golodets has demanded that compulsory vaccinations must be introduced for all groups deemed at risk. ""If people work with animals they must be vaccinated against anthrax,"" she said. ""We are dealing now with an outbreak of anthrax [in Yamal] and we have found out that no one was vaccinated in this region."" She said: ""Professional groups can become a source and transmitters of all infectious diseases that occur in this country.""Some teachers and tutors working at childcare centres ""are not even vaccinated against chickenpox and measles. This is outrageous. They become infected together with the children and they transmit the disease. The consequences are dramatic. This must not be tolerated.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The 2nd report is worth accessing to see the pictures of workers covered by insects in daunting numbers. We have seen biting flies involved in wildlife epidemics before; the latest was the decimation of deer in west Texas in 2001, with some ranch mortalities reaching 80-90 per cent. And when the circumstances are right random sporadic outbreaks get to explode thanks to haemophagic and necrophagic fly activity, which are facilitated by rainfall, or in this case widespread tundra thawing. - Mod.MHJMaps of the region can be seen at <http://www.worldatlas.com/img/world-state/yamalo-nenets-autonomous-okrug-autonomous-district-russia.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/428>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
