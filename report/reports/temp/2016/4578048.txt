News10 [edited]<http://news10.com/2016/10/21/four-individuals-at-local-nursing-home-test-positive-for-legionnaires-disease/>A local nursing home is warning the public after 4 people who were at the center developed legionnaires' disease. The 4 people with the disease all spent time at the Wesley Health Care Center in Saratoga Springs [New York]. 3 of them lived on the same floor; however, it is unknown if they caught the disease at the center. ""It's not been identified that Wesley is the source,"" Wesley Community CEO Brian Nealon said.The health care center was 1st alerted on 13 Oct [2016] by Saratoga Hospital. It was told 2 former short-term rehabilitation residents and 1 employee had tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria and were hospitalized. All 3 are currently recuperating at home and are expected to make a full recovery.But on Thursday [20 Oct 2016], the center learned about another case. ""Also was a former resident of the nursing home,"" Nealon said. The elderly man became ill about one week after leaving the center and was hospitalized.""The main way that this disease is caught is by breathing it in through a water droplet,"" Dr. James Saperstone, of CapitalCare Medical Group, said. Dr. Saperstone said the disease is not spread person-to-person, but those with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to the bacteria if they're exposed. ""It's pretty rare, but occasionally, we see it,"" he said. [In addition to acquiring legionnaires' disease by inhaling aerosolized _Legionella_, the disease can be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water and possible person-to-person transmission has been described (Correia AM, GonÌ¤alves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356>).]The center is working with the state and the Saratoga County Health Department on taking precautions. They're also monitoring residents more closely.On Monday [17 Oct 2016], a water testing company took nearly 3 dozen water samples from campus buildings. Also, on Friday [21 Oct 2016], the center implemented a water restriction plan in hopes of preventing a major outbreak in the future. ""Just educate people about what is going on and what isn't going on,"" Nealon said.New York State guidelines require all health facilities to frequently test for _Legionella_. The health center said it's followed the protocols with its most recent test in September [2016?] showing negative results.[Byline: Lauren Linder]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[The news report does not say how the diagnoses of legionnaires' disease were made in the 4 patents, e.g., by culture or urinary antigen assay for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, which could identify the _Legionella_ species involved. The news report says that multiple water samples from the Wesley Health Care Center in Saratoga Springs, New York were being tested, presumably by culturing for _Legionella_. All 4 patients either lived or worked at the Wesley Health Care Center in Saratoga Springs. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information with regard to this outbreak from knowledgeable sources.
