Conserved differences in protein sequence determine the human pathogenicity of Ebolaviruses. Scientific Reports; 6:23743 | DOI: 10.1038/srep23743 <http://www.nature.com/articles/srep23743>.Reston viruses are the only Ebolaviruses that are not pathogenic in humans. We analyzed 196 Ebolavirus genomes and identified specificity, determining positions (SDPs) in all 9 Ebolavirus proteins that distinguish Reston viruses from the 4 human pathogenic Ebolaviruses. A subset of these SDPs will explain the differences in human pathogenicity between Reston and the other 4 Ebolavirus species. Structural analysis was performed to identify those SDPs that are likely to have a functional effect. This analysis revealed novel functional insights in particular for Ebolavirus proteins VP40 and VP24. The VP40 SDP P85T interferes with VP40 function by altering octamer formation. The VP40 SDP Q245P affects the structure and hydrophobic core of the protein and consequently protein function. Three VP24 SDPs (T131S, M136L, Q139R) are likely to impair VP24 binding to human karyopherin alpha5 (KPNA5) and therefore inhibition of interferon signaling. Since VP24 is critical for Ebolavirus adaptation to novel hosts, and only a few SDPs distinguish Reston virus VP24 from VP24 of other Ebolaviruses, human pathogenic Reston viruses may emerge. This is of concern, since Reston viruses circulate in domestic pigs and can infect humans.Discussion---------In this study, we have combined the computational identification of residues that distinguish Reston viruses from human pathogenic Ebolavirus species with protein structural analysis to identify determinants of Ebolavirus pathogenicity. The results from this first comprehensive comparison of all available genomic information on Reston viruses and human pathogenic Ebolaviruses detected SDPs in all proteins but only few of them may be responsible for the lack of Reston virus human pathogenicity.Our analysis mapped 47 of the 189 SDPs onto protein structure, so additional SDPs may be relevant but the structural data needed to reliably identify them is missing. Although it is difficult to conclude the extent to which each individual SDP contributes to the differences in human pathogenicity between Reston viruses and the other Ebolaviruses, we can identify certain SDPs that have a particularly high likelihood to be involved. SDPs present in the oligomer interfaces of VP30, VP35, and VP40 may affect viral protein function. VP24 SDPs may interfere with VP24-KPNA5 binding and affect viral inhibition of the host cell interferon response. These findings suggest that changes in protein-protein interactions represent a central cause for the variations in human pathogenicity observed in Ebolaviruses. VP24 and VP40 in particular contain multiple SDPs that are likely to contribute to differences in human pathogenicity. Where possible the SDPs have been considered collectively, such as for VP24, where most of the SDPs are present on a single face of the protein (Fig. 5a) and 3 of them are present in the interface with KPNA5. Beyond this it is difficult to interpret how any combination of SDPs might be responsible for the differences in human pathogenicity.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Researchers found relatively few differences between Reston and the other Ebola virus strains, but their results pointed to a few changes in one Ebola virus protein (VP24) that may be needed to alter Ebola Reston into a virus that can cause human disease.Ebola Reston was 1st recognized in 1990 in a shipment of 100 macaques from the Philippines brought into a facility in Reston, VA, USA, already housing 500 clean macaques. Ebola Reston is one of 5 known Ebola virus species found to be highly contagious in monkeys but not in humans. The introduction of Ebola Reston in macaaques from the Philippines indicated that the disease was not only found in Africa. It was determined that transmission was particularly quick in a lab setting, because the virus appeared to pass between rooms to infect susceptible monkeys -- but that could have been by fomites, not necessarily airborne.- Mods.LK/JW]******[2] Africa (Tanzania): suspicious deaths with hemorrhagic manifestations RFIDate: Thu 24 Mar 2016Source: The Citizen [edited]<http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Health-authorities-bury-two-killed-by-Ebola-like-illness/-/1840340/3131696/-/1264vhbz/-/index.html>Bodies of 2 people who died recently in the city after suffering an illness likened to Ebola and dengue, were yesterday [23 Mar 2016] interred by health officials under heightened precautions.The Citizen saw health workers wearing personal protective gear aboard a special vehicle carrying 2 caskets bearing the bodies of the deceased headed for burial in the city. The bodies were being transported from the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) to Mwananyamala burial grounds in Konondoni District.This week, health authorities warned the public of diseases prevalent in Tanzania that resemble Ebola. The permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Children and the Elderly, Dr Mpoki Ulisubisya, mentioned the diseases to be dengue, yellow fever and Rift Valley fever (RVF). However, he stressed that other viral infections such as Ebola, Marburg and Zika fever have not been diagnosed in the country.The warning came after 2 people -- one from Iringa and another from Old Moshi -- fell ill and were rushed to MNH with symptoms of high fever and bleeding from body orifices.The reports come at a time when there is an outbreak of yellow fever in neighbouring Kenya.Two people died in Nairobi recently, and the Kenyan ministry of Health issued an alert over the outbreak of the disease that has recently killed over 60 people in Angola, according to international media reports.The case of a person who died in Kenya was reported to have entered the country from Angola.Patients suspected of yellow fever usually have symptoms such as chills, nausea, joint pains and sometimes can bleed from the nose or mouth.Early this week, Health minister Ummy Mwalimu said blood samples of those who died in Dar es Salaam recently had proved negative for Ebola when tests were conducted locally, but there were further efforts to try and confirm with the Kenya Institute for Medical Research in Nairobi.Until yesterday [23 Mar 2016], the results from Kenya hadn't been received, according to the head of the pathology unit at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Dr Praxeda Ogweyo. She noted that there was no other report of a patient who had suffered a similar illness.The bereaved family members were only given a chance to witness the burial, but some of them expressed anger towards the authorities' order even as the procedure was meant for their own safety. Relatives of the dead, who had hired a van to go to the burial grounds, expressed mixed feelings when interviewed at the MNH. ""We were only told at the last minute that we can't bury our sister because she had Ebola-like symptoms. We had insisted that we want to take the body back home, but the doctors said 'No'. There is absolutely nothing we can do now,"" one of the relatives coming from Kilimanjaro, who asked not to be named, told The Citizen.Aboard the hired bus was a man who hails from Iringa, who said loudly that it was okay to listen to the medical authorities because their decisions were geared toward their own safety.[Byline: Syriacus Buguzi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The journalist should have mentioned that a key symptom of yellow fever is the jaundice that gives it its name, but is not always present.

See Rift Valley fever - Uganda: (KA) 20160313.4090478. This etiology was further confirmed by Dr. Julius Lutwama <jjlutwama03@yahoo.com> in a response to a query by Mod.JW in which he wrote: ""It was Rift Valley Fever infection. We got 2 confirmed cases. There was also one suspected case that was buried before a sample was picked. The 2 confirmed cases are still in hospital. There was a confirmed animal sample too.""ProMED thanks Dr. Lutwama for his comment. Dr. Lutwama is an arbovirologist at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).It is not known whether these 2 current cases also are Rift Valley fever. There have been RVF outbreaks in Somalia (2006-2007), Kenya (2006-2007), Tanzania (2007), and Sudan (2007-2008) which showed extension to districts which were not involved before. These outbreaks also demonstrated the changing epidemiology of the disease from being originally associated with livestock to a seemingly highly virulent form infecting humans and causing considerably high-fatality rates.Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important neglected, emerging, mosquito-borne disease with severe negative economic impact as it affects human and animal health. The disease is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) an acute febrile arbovirus in the _Phlebovirus_ genus and Bunyaviridae family. (Excerpted from YE Himeidan et al. 2014. Recent Outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever in East Africa and the Middle East. Front Public Health. 2014; 2: 169 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4186272/>.)However, other possible causes for these cases are dengue hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever, among other less likely possibilities such as Ebola and Marburg viruses.
