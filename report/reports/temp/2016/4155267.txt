Big News Network [edited]<http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/243047873/mysterious-disease-kills-at-least-23-babies-in-kenya>A mysterious disease has claimed the lives of at least 23 infants in Kenya's Nakuru and Baringo counties in the past 4 weeks. Area Senator James Mungai has since called for the intervention of the ministry of health to address the issue.The disease -- which results in symptoms such as high fever, coughing, body weakness and sweating -- was initially thought to be viral pneumonia, but tests by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) were negative.Mungai said that at least 215 cases have so far been confirmed, with babies aged between one day and 11 months being the most affected. KEMRI officers have already started investigating the cases, Daily Nation reports.This is not the 1st epidemic to be reported in the counties. Last year [2015], reports indicated that over 60 people died from a cholera outbreak due to poor hygiene and improper sewerage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The illness is described in the news report above as being febrile with respiratory symptoms in children 11 months of age or less, and the case fatality rate is 10.7%.Acute respiratory infections are common causes of morbidity and mortality in young children throughout the world, especially in developing countries, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most frequent lower respiratory tract pathogen in infants and young children worldwide (<http://www.virologyj.com/content/9/1/78#B43>). RSV is a common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children under one year of age in the United States and is a frequent cause of hospitalization of infants and young children (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14615709>). In the US, RSV infections generally occur during fall, winter, and early spring. In tropical countries, the occurrence of RSV infections has been noted to occur in the rainy and cold season, which has been attributed to overcrowding as a result of populations staying more to their homes (<http://www.virologyj.com/content/9/1/78#B43>).RSV bronchopulmonary infections in hospitalized children can be associated with super-infection in the lower airways with bacteria, commonly due to _Haemophilus influenzae_ and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20700753>).Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) is 2nd only to RSV as a cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children (<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/224708-overview>). Other respiratory viruses include the influenza viruses (ProMED-mail post Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (136): Argentina, pediatric mortality archive no. 20091227.4359), human parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus.Tests for viral causes of pneumonia in the Kenyan outbreak are said to be ""negative"" in the news report above, but we are not told specifically what tests were done. ProMED-mail would appreciate more detailed information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources.Baringo and Nakuru are adjacent counties located in west-central Kenya in the former Rift Valley province, which, as of the March 2013 Kenyan general election, was divided into counties.
