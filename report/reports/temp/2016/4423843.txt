KWCH12 [edited]<http://www.kwch.com/content/news/Wichita-woman-claims-kids-got-hand-foot-and-mouth-at-city-park-390337802.html>A Wichita woman says her 5 kids and 10 other kids she knows, all contracted hand-foot-mouth disease while at a city water park.""I have 5 kids and they all have it. Each and every one of them,"" said [JW]. ""All of a sudden they got a really high fever, that's the 1st stage of it, a super high fever, and they shake like this, really bad, I mean they shake crazy.""She says her doctor confirmed the disease and told her she got it at a water park. She says 10 other kids, her nieces and nephews, and other friends also got it.""Do you see his feet? I mean his skin is peeling. Yeah, this is awful,"" she said talking about her 1-year-old son.She believes they all contracted it at Riverside Park's splash pad.""This is supposed to be a safe place for kids to play. Not just that, but they're playing in the water and then they're going to the playground and stuff and if they're contaminated with it, then they're touching things and they're contaminating the playground as well,"" said [JW].We called the City of Wichita to find out how much it tests and how often it tests the water at Riverside Park. We were told the water is tested every single day and at no time during the time in question was the water anything but safe.""From what we have, the information we have, is the water has been treated and is safe,"" said Troy Houtman, the city's Parks and Rec Director.Houtman says to his knowledge, no one called the city, until we called Tuesday morning [10 Aug 2016], to report a concern.""We don't even know for sure if this is where it came from, but we want to double check and make sure and cross all of our t's and dot all of our ""i's"" and make sure that it's safe,"" said Houtman.And that includes testing the playground equipment as well.[AW] says her kids have had hand-foot-mouth [disease] before, but says she's not worried about the potential disease.""It's too late now. If it is in there, they've already been exposed, so we'll just let them have fun,"" said [AW].But for [JW] and her kids fun is the furthest from their minds. ""They said it has to pass. They don't give you any medicine. It burns. It blisters on the hands feet and mouth, and in the mouth,"" she said.If you have a concern about any of the Wichita parks, contact the Wichita Parks and Recreation Department, by calling (316) 268-4361.[Byline: Scott Evans]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
