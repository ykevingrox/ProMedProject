Star Tribune [edited]<http://www.startribune.com/general-mills-issues-major-flour-recall-linked-with-e-coli-outbreak/381408341/>General Mills, owner of the venerable Gold Medal brand, has recalled over 10 million pounds of flour after 38 people in 20 states got sick from a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_ that may have originated in the company's products. The Golden Valley-based packaged food giant Tue 31 May 2016, announced the voluntary recall of some lots of Gold Medal -- the nation's bestselling retail flour --, as well as flour sold under the Wondra and Signature Kitchens brands. Signature Kitchens is a store brand sold at several major grocery chains including Safeway, Albertsons, Jewel, Vons and Acme. The CDC said Tue 31 May 2016, there have been 10 hospitalizations associated with an outbreak linked to flour. No deaths have been reported.The Minnesota Department of Health confirmed that 3 of the 38 victims lived in the Twin Cities area. All 3, 2 adults and a child, have recovered, and none was hospitalized, said spokesman Doug Schultz._E. coli_ O121, a less common strain of the [enterohemorrhagic group of] _E. coli_, can cause bloody diarrhea, cramps and dehydration. Seniors, very young children and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to such an illness.State and federal health authorities have been investigating a flour-related outbreak of _E. coli_ O121 from 21 Dec 2015 to 3 May 2016, General Mills said in a statement. The Minnesota health department said the cases here occurred in January and March 2016. The CDC has not released information on other states involved in the outbreak.""It must have been substantial contamination for the outbreak to basically go nationwide,"" said Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food safety and suing food companies. Marler noted that Mills made its recall even though the CDC has yet to detail the outbreak on its website. ""I think what General Mills has done here is that they are getting ahead of an obvious problem, which is a positive thing.""The CDC found that about half of the 38 sickened people reported making homemade food with flour before becoming ill, according to General Mills. Some reported using a General Mills brand of flour, and some also might have consumed raw dough or batter. General Mills said it has not found _E. coli_ O121 in any of its products or at its flour facilities, nor has it received any illness reports directly from consumers. The flour involved in the recall was mostly produced at General Mills' plant in Kansas City, MO.Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ outbreaks from flour-related products are not common, but a handful have occurred in recent years. The most well-known was a 2009 outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 linked to NestlÌ©'s Toll House cookie dough. It sickened over 70 people in 30 states, including six in Minnesota. NestlÌ© issued a big recall due to the outbreak. The CDC reported that many victims ate raw Toll House cookie dough; a practice frowned upon by food safety experts. Just as cooking meat properly kills E. coli bacteria, fully cooked baked goods should pose less of a threat.Also, General Mills says that in order to kill bacteria such as _E. coli_, it heat-treats flour used in its Pillsbury refrigerated dough products. However, raw flour sold as an ingredient for baking is not heat-treated, because the process ""would impact its performance such as rising properties,"" the company said in a statement.General Mills said it made the recall out of an ""abundance of caution."" Liz Nordlie, president of General Mills' baking division, said in a statement: ""As a leading provider of flour for 150 years, we felt it was important to not only recall the product and replace it for consumers if there was any doubt, but also to take this opportunity to remind our consumers how to safely handle flour."" The company advises consumers never to eat raw dough or batter.[Byline: Mike Hughlett]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A previous outbreak of _E. coli_ O121 associated with flour was reported in 2013. The products were frozen chicken quesadillas, pizza slices and other snack foods that were commercially prepared.This outbreak once again underscores the relevance of non-O157 strains of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157.If a laboratory is only using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify Enterohaemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) instead of Shiga toxin gene PCR (by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol), the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (1), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (2).Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear. Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in EHEC infections treated with antimicrobials (3), antimicrobials should not be used for known acute cases.References----------1.
