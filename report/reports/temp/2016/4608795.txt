High fever, joint pain, bleeding from the nose and gums are among the symptoms of the disease. A number of KFD cases are reported from Karnataka state every year.Although the formalin inactivated vaccine available has been used for years to control KFD, the increasing trend of the disease in the last few years, irrespective of routine vaccination, requires a comprehensive review of vaccination strategy/formulations. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/307>.]
