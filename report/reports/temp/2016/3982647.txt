As in many other developed countries, Japan has been seeing an increase in notifications of syphilis, particularly since 2010. From around 2010 to 2013, much of this increase was attributed to male cases, and among them, mostly MSM [men who have sex with men]. However, since around 2014, the ongoing increase has been attributed more to heterosexual transmission rather than to MSM, for both men and women. And, from week 1 to 43 in 2015 [29 Dec 2014 to 25 Oct 2015], the reported number of heterosexual cases among men surpassed that of cases in MSM, and for women, the number of reported cases has more than doubled compared to the same period in 2014.Further detailed information is available in English at <http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/survei/2292-idwr/idwr-article-en/6203-idwrc-1544-en.html>, ""Increase in syphilis notifications and characteristics of reported cases, as of October 2015."" In addition, detailed syphilis information (based on the national surveillance data) from 2008-2014 is communicated in English at <http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol36-e/865-iasr/5413-tpc420.html>, ""Syphilis 2008-2014."" Lastly, the earlier MSM increase has been described for Tokyo in the article at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370433>, ""Increase in primary and secondary syphilis notifications in men in Tokyo, 2007-2013."" (Sugishita et al. Jpn J Infect Dis. 2015.)We hope the ProMED-mail readership finds this official information from Japan useful and that the correct information on the Japanese syphilis situation can be shared.We would sincerely appreciate your understanding and posting of the official information above.--communicated by:Tomimasa SunagawaInfectious Disease Surveillance Center,National Institute of Infectious DiseasesJapan<sunatomi@niid.go.jp>[ProMED-mail thanks Tomimasa Sunagawa for the clarification and references to national surveillance data for Japan in English.The following is the report [referenced above] from the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, dated 13 Nov 2015, and entitled:Increase in syphilis notifications and characteristics of reported cases, as of October 2015 (available at <http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/survei/2292-idwr/idwr-article-en/6203-idwrc-1544-en.html>):""From epidemiologic week 1 to 43, 2015 [29 Dec 2014 to 25 Oct 2015], 2037 cases of syphilis were diagnosed and officially reported by physicians according to the Infectious Diseases Control Law (as of 28 Oct 2015). This represents a 1.5-fold increase in notifications compared to the same period in the previous year. 1463 cases were male (1.4-fold increase relative to the same period last year), and 574 cases were female (2 fold increase relative to the same period last year), indicating a substantial increase in female cases.""As for the reported routes of transmission, among male cases, 615 reported heterosexual transmission (1.7-fold increase relative to the same period last year) and 487 reported homosexual transmission (that is, men who have sex with men [MSM]; 1.0-fold increase relative to the same period last year). Among female cases, 405 reported heterosexual transmission (2.1-fold increase relative to the same period last year).""Increase in primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases were observed among both genders. Among male cases, 990 were P&S cases, representing a 1.6-fold increase relative to the same period last year. Among female cases, 323 were P&S cases (2.4-fold increase relative to the same period last year), and 3/4 of these cases were aged 15-35 years. Notably, with 177 cases, those aged 20-24 years made up the largest proportion of the female P&S cases, and represented a 2.7-fold increase relative to the same period last year. Furthermore, 10 cases of congenital syphilis have been reported so far as of October 2015 (9 cases during the same period in the previous year), and warrants careful monitoring of the situation.""In summary, while an increase in reported syphilis cases associated with MSM was observed during 2010-2013 (1-4), 2015 has seen a continuing increase in cases associated with heterosexual transmission (5). The current situation warrants ongoing monitoring of trends in syphilis, and raising awareness among high-risk groups is imperative. Specific messages include the following: having casual sexual contact with multiple partners is a risk factor, and that the risk of syphilis infection can increase without proper use of condoms under those circumstances, that syphilis can be transmitted through oral or anal sex, and that having syphilis once does not prevent reinfection (6, 7).""If signs or symptoms suspicious of syphilis occur, early diagnosis and treatment are important. If a patient is diagnosed with syphilis, the case requires notification under the Infectious Diseases Control Law. And, communication to and testing of sex partners is also important. Further information regarding syphilis such as transmission, signs and symptoms, treatment, and prevention are provided on the ""Syphilis Q&A"" site (<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/seisakunitsuite/ bunya/kenkou_iryou/kenkou/kekkaku-kansenshou/seikansenshou/qanda2.html> [in Japanese]).""References are available at the source URL. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.][See Also:2015---Syphilis - Japan (02): increased incidence 20151229.3899097Syphilis - Japan: increased incidence 20151201.38306722014---Syphilis - Japan: increased incidence, MSM 20140412.2400101].................................................ml/mj/jw"
