Oral/PowerPoint presentation, Study Day ""One Health: Man, Agriculture, Environment"", Agricultural Research Organization - Volcani Center, Beit-Dagan [in Hebrew; trans. & summ. Mod.AS, edited]Ref: Bardenstein S (Kimron Veterinary Institute, Brucellosis laboratory): The epidemiology of brucellosis in the spirit of One Health----------------------------------------------------------------------[The following data have been derived from the PowerPoint presentation]The information presented is based upon the results of tests carried out by the brucellosis laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI), Beit Dagan.Number of _Brucella melitensis_ isolates from samples obtained from human patients throughout the country:2012 - 138;2013 - 132;2014 - 231;2015 - 176;2016 - 258.The 2016 figures include 22 human patients reportedly infected by the consumption of unpasteurized, commercially marketed camel milk supplied by a (named) enterprise.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[While the increase in the number of Brucella isolates from humans since 2012 may reflect a growing health problem, the statistics of human ""Malta fever"" cases as published by the department of epidemiology in the Ministry of Health, which are based upon weekly reports from hospitals, are different:2005 (141); 2006 (138); 2007 (152); 2008 (149); 2009 (136); 2010 (139); 2011 (127); 2012 (183); 2013 (336); 2014 (593); 2015 (411), 2016 (452).This may reflect the fact that the diagnosis ""brucellosis"" might be based, at least in part of the suspected cases, upon clinical, epidemiological, and serological observations, only partially confirmed by bacteriological investigations leading to pathogen isolation.The cases in humans infected from camel milk reflect an event exhaustively discussed during 2016 (6 relevant ProMED-mail's reports available in ""see also""). The presentation mentioned 22 patients from whom the bacterium could be isolated. The actual number of camel-milk-derived human cases may have been higher. Most of the published cases were children.An epidemiological investigation into this serious event, which also had legal ramifications (see previous posts), is said to be ongoing; results and their publication are anticipated.The brucellosis laboratory at the KVI is Israel's national center for brucellosis diagnosis and an FAO/OIE international reference laboratory.The ""One Health"" study day was held under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health, the Koret School of veterinary Medicine (Hebrew University, Jerusalem), and Israel Veterinary Services and Animal Health. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.]
