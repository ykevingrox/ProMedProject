The students fell ill due to having the medicine on empty stomachs, but no one is in danger.With proper treatment and rest, the students will recover quickly, said Dr Tapas Kumar Paul, a residence doctor of the hospital.However, some of the students have already returned home after treatment, he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Bangladesh can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Bangladesh.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13540>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJAccording to the WHO, albendazole and mebendazole tablets are the most commonly used drugs in school deworming programs (<http://www.who.int/intestinal_worms/resources/en/at_a_glance.pdf>).Albendazole and mebendazole should always be taken on a full stomach, or certainly with a meal. Providing it without a meal is likely to cause stomach upset. Severe vomiting and/or prolonged vomiting can lead to dehydration and this may be what the children were treated for, in addition to stopping the vomiting. - Mod.TG]
