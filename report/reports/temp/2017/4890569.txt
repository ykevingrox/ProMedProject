7th Space [edited]<http://7thspace.com/headlines/534237/update_on_cluster_of_coronavirus_cases_in_siu_lam_hospital.html>The following is issued on behalf of the hospital authority:Regarding an earlier announcement on a cluster of patients infected with coronavirus OC43 in a male ward for severe intellectual disability, the spokesperson of Siu Lam Hospital made the following update today [Tue 7 Mar 2017]: ""One more 59 year old male patient in the ward has presented with fever and respiratory symptoms. Appropriate viral tests were arranged for the patient and the test result was positive to coronavirus OC43. The patient concerned is being treated in isolation and is in a stable condition.""Admission to the ward has been suspended and restricted visiting has been imposed. Infection control measures have already been stepped up according to established guidelines. All other patients in the ward are under close surveillance. The case has been reported to the Hospital Authority Head Office and the Centre for Health Protection for necessary follow-up.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The 6 coronaviruses that can infect people are: alpha coronaviruses 229E and NL63, and beta coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV (the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS), and MERS-CoV (the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS), <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/>.HCoV-OC43 is part of the second genetic group of coronaviruses [see: Lai MM and Cavanagh D. The molecular biology of coronaviruses. Adv Virus Res. 1997;48:1-100] and displays higher identity levels with virus strains that belong to this group, including SARS-HCoV.HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were thought to account for 5 to 30 per cent of human respiratory tract infections, and outbreaks due to HCoV-OC43 also have been reported, <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194943/>. Furthermore, the virulence of human CoV-OC43 in elderly populations has been demonstrated in previous studies that also report cross-reactivity to antibody against nucleocapsid proteins in serological tests for SARS-CoV, <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18382647>.The different HCoVs often cocirculate, with 1 or 2 HCoVs being predominant depending on the geographical area and year.From the above report, it is clear that the responsible agent has been identified and that proper precautionary measures have been taken to control further disease transmission. - Mod.UBAIt would be helpful to receive further information about the ""earlier announcement on a cluster of patients"" made by Siu Lam Hospital. This report is written as an update, but ProMED-mail has not seen the earlier report. - Mod.SHA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.]
