Opinion [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2017/0720/noticias.php?id=225174>The Departmental Health Services (SEDES) of La Paz intensified surveillance and strengthened actions against yellow fever in the department due to 2 confirmed cases in Norte de los Yungas.During the current period, 4 yellow fever cases are registered, of which the deaths of 2 were reported -- a 9-year-old girl and a 38-year-old man.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[These 4 yellow fever (YF) cases were doubtless due to spill over of the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission to unvaccinated humans, rather than to _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission. Sporadic human cases occur in the Amazon Basin, including the Bolivian tropics, as spill-over from this sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Although not stated in the above report, these 4 individuals almost certainly had not been vaccinated, a problem in the sparsely populated, rural areas in the Amazon Basin, where health services are not readily available. On [Mon 9 Jan 2017], a Danish tourist who came to Caranavi in the tropical area of La Paz department, Bolivia became infected with the virus [see ProMED-mail post 20170211.4832508 - Mod.JH]. Individuals residing in or traveling to these areas should be vaccinated at least 10 days before possible exposure to the virus.Maps of Bolivia can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg> and a map of La Paz can be seen at<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10123>. - Mod.TY]
