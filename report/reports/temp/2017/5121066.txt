WFAA [edited]<http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/north-texas-2-year-old-on-life-support-fighting-e-coli-infection/450155766>A 2-year-old boy is on life support at Children's Medical Center of Dallas [Texas] while investigators search for the source of the potentially deadly _E. coli_ bacterium that is ravaging the child's body. The boy and his parents returned to their home in Ennis [TX] after a trip to Oklahoma. Within days the young boy was suffering from stomach virus-type symptoms. A fecal test confirmed _E. coli_ and they quickly took him to Children's Medical Center Dallas.The most dangerous forms of _E. coli_ produce a Shiga toxin. In this case, it led to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), the abnormal destruction of red blood cells which leads to kidney failure. 2 surgeries later the child is on life support with his parents hoping that this weekend [24-25 Jun 2017] he will finally be able to breathe on his own. ""We can't hold him. We can't love on him. All we can do is just stand at the bedside,"" said the boy's mom.What they don't know is where the bacteria came from. It is most commonly a foodborne infection. The bacterium is found in the intestines of cattle and other animals. Contaminated and undercooked ground beef is often a culprit: a major outbreak on the west coast of the USA in 1992-93 killed 4 children and sickened more than 800 when _E. coli_ contaminated beef was sold at multiple fast food chain locations. Fecal contamination of crops like sprouts and greens has killed scores of people too. Young children whose immune systems are not fully developed, and the elderly whose immune systems may be compromised, are most at risk.Surveys by the CDC estimate that 100 000 illnesses, 3000 hospitalizations, and 90 deaths a year in the USA are caused by Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ bacteria.""Most parents like us had no idea you know the dangers of something like this. And it's everywhere. _E. coli_ is something that's everywhere,"" said the mother.Investigators will try to backtrack and find out where this _E. coli_ infection came from. Meanwhile his parents pray he survives his encounter with the potentially deadly bacterium. ""I have faith he's gonna come out on top,"" said his dad.The Texas Department of State Health Services confirms to WFAA that they are investigating this case and that they are the lead agency for the investigation. No additional details will be given because of confidentiality. So far there are no other related cases.[Byline: Kevin Reece]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as co-trimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.A number of studies have studied Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).References----------1.
