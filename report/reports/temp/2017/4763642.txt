Hepatitis E illness is usually self-limiting, and severe, prolonged infections are unusual except in immunocompromised patients. We describe HEV infection in a previously healthy man in France who received massive transfusions of blood, plasma, and platelets after a traumatic skiing accident.At hospital admission, the patient was in hemorrhagic shock caused by severe blunt splenic injury. He underwent an immediate splenectomy with massive transfusion: 9 packed red blood cells units, 7 fresh frozen plasma units, and 1 whole blood platelet pool. Because of hemopneumothorax, multiple rib fractures, and pulmonary contusions, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome developed, and the patient was treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 3 days. The patient received another whole blood platelet pool transfusion at day 5 posttrauma and was treated with renal replacement therapy for 6 weeks.On day 15 posttrauma, the patient had icterus, and liver blood tests revealed cholestasis; ultrasound findings showed acalculous cholecystitis. Because bile drainage via percutaneous cholecystectomy was insufficient and led to septic shock (day 18), the patient underwent open cholecystectomy. The diagnosis of ulcerated cholecystitis was confirmed by histologic examination; _Enterococcus faecium_ was isolated from blood and bile samples. Cholestasis, icterus, and cytolysis gradually resolved over the next week postoperatively; however, liver blood test results did not return to normal. Histological examination of the liver tissue from the biopsy performed during cholecystectomy gave normal results, and there was no evidence of drug-induced toxicity.At day 40, liver blood tests indicated a renewed increase in cholestasis and cytolysis. Meanwhile, the patient's clinical condition had improved, renal function had recovered, and the tracheal tube was removed. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed normal findings. Viral serologic tests were negative for Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. However, reverse transcription PCR testing revealed HEV positivity, with HEV viremia reaching 180 000 copies/mL. Serologic tests for HEV IgM (ASSURE HEV IgM Rapid Test; MP Biomedicals, Singapore) and IgG (HEV IgG ELISA; Wantai, Coutaboeuf, France) were negative at that time, but a blood sample taken on day 75 posttrauma showed HEV IgM.The patient was not considered to be immunocompromised. Serologic tests for HIV were negative, leukocyte counts were within reference ranges, and no steroids were given to treat trauma. Neither the patient nor his family reported recent travel to HEV endemic areas or intake of uncooked or poorly cooked pork or game meat in the 3 months before the accident. All transfused blood products were retrospectively tested for HEV, and the blood platelet pool transfused at day 5 was identified as coming from an HEV-infected donor, who had viremia reaching 290 copies/mL. Evidence of direct blood contamination was provided by genotyping, which showed the virus in the donor and blood platelet pool were identical. HEV from the patient and the contaminated platelet pool were both HEV subtype 3f, and a phylogenetic study of the open reading frame 2 coding region by neighbor-joining cluster analysis confirmed the homology.Because the patient was at high risk for severe acute HEV infection, treatment with 800 mg/day of ribavirin was initiated on day 45; the patient experienced severe nausea and vomiting but had no anemia. The course of the HEV infection reflected a slow response to the treatment. At 80 days posttrauma, the patient was still icteric with unchanged liver blood test results; HEV viremia was higher than before (23 400 000). After 2 months on ribavirin treatment (day 110), HEV viremia started to decrease, but 3 months of treatment were needed for viremia levels to reach under 100 copies/mL (day 135).The potential for HEV transmission by contaminated blood product transfusion, attributable to the high prevalence of HEV infection in asymptomatic blood donors, has been reported (1). Prevalence of HEV infection is about 1/1500 blood donations in Europe, and an HEV transmission rate as high as 42% was observed in immunocompromised patients given HEV-positive blood products (2). Chronic liver infections have developed in immunosuppressed patients (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients, patients with HIV infection, and patients with hematological disease) given HEV genotype 3-contaminated products (3,4). A few cases of prolonged HEV viremia in immunocompetent patients have been described (5,6), but none were transfusion-induced HEV infections in patients after trauma.Successful treatments with ribavirin have been reported for transplant patients and patients with leukemia or HIV, including those at high risk for severe HEV infection (7). Treatment with ribavirin is usually characterized by rapid viral clearance (8) and ribavirin-induced anemia. Ribavirin could act by direct inhibition of viral replication or an immunomodulatory effect (9).This case describes HEV infection acquired by an immunocompetent patient through transfusion of a contaminated blood product. Clinicians should consider the risk for HEV infection in trauma patients who receive large transfusions.[Authors: Loyrion E, Trouve-Buisson T, Pouzol P, et al]References---------1.

In Europe, the vast majority of autochthonous HEV infections are caused by HEV genotype 3 (gt-3) and are linked to the consumption of contaminated food. In general, HEV gt-3 infection remains asymptomatic or presents as mild self-limited acute hepatitis [5]. HEV IgG seroprevalence in Europe ranges from 17 percent in Germany to 26 percent in France among the general population, indicating widespread contact with HEV [6,7]. A HEV IgG seroprevalence of 6.8 percent was determined among German blood donors in 2011, and HEV RNA was detected in 0.08 percent of donations [8,9]. Juhl et al. reported an HEV IgG incidence in donors of 0.35 percent per year [9]. A total of 7.4 million blood products were administered in Germany in 2013, and between 1600 and 5900 HEV RNA-positive blood donations could be occurring in Germany per year [8,10]. In the Netherlands, 1 HEV-positive donation per day was reported, which implies that transmission by transfusion could be a likely event in both countries [11].An estimated 30-40 percent of blood products in Germany were transfused to immunocompromised patients and these patients are at risk of developing chronic HEV gt-3 infection with increased mortality [5]. Sequence analysis of HEV strains from the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands showed close homology indicating a geographically confined circulation [8]. This is supported by the high degree of sequence identity of our and recent Czech and Dutch sequences. Zoonotic transmission from pigs to humans seems to be the major mode of infection, but occupational exposure to pigs was not reported in our case [6].Two important observations were made in this study. Firstly, we could show that the infectious dose required for HEV infection seems to be low, that is, HEV RNA concentrations close to the limit of detection of the real-time RT-PCR. Low levels of HEV RNA in asymptomatic donors have already been reported but without evidence for transmission [8,9]. Interestingly, Juhl et al speculated that viremia of around 125 IU/mL in the presence of anti-HEV IgM was not sufficient for transfusion-associated infection [9]. However, it is not clear if HEV antibodies can prevent infection. A recent study showed that infectious HEV could be propagated in cell culture in the presence of HEV-specific antibodies, suggesting that they do not efficiently reduce virus infectivity [12]. In addition, a clinical study demonstrated that anti-HEV IgG did not uniformly protect against re-infection [13].Secondly, the duration of viremia in our asymptomatic donor did not exceed 45 days, based on the time interval between the last and the first HEV RNA-negative donation. The interval of 14 days between 1st and last HEV RNA-positive donation was even shorter than the 27 to 58 days reported by Slot et al., but could be due to the shorter sampling interval in our study [11]. From our and previously published data it is obvious that highly sensitive methods would be required if screening for HEV RNA were to be considered for blood products.To conclude, we could demonstrate that transmission of HEV by asymptomatic donors with low-level viremia is possible. Current German guidelines in transfusion medicine do not recommend testing for HEV. Importantly, with regard to the possible severe consequences of transfusion-associated transmission of HEV, especially in immunocompromised patients, the necessity of screening for HEV RNA needs to be discussed in countries with a high HEV prevalence. However, more data regarding the HEV disease burden due to blood transfusions are needed before recommendations can be made.References----------2.
