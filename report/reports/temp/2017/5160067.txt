EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The national reference laboratory for bacterial enteric diseases in the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine has tested 27 rectal swabs from Medina, Misamis Oriental sent by the regional epidemiology and surveillance unit (RESU) region 10, and 17/27 rectal swabs are positive for _Vibrio cholera_ serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED acknowledges the continued efforts of the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project members in reporting important information regarding outbreaks.As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is ""non-O1""), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the ""classical"" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158>.]
