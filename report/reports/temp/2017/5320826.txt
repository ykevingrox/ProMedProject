Raw milk from the K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas (northwest of Fort Worth), tested positive for a rare but potentially serious bacterium known as _Brucella [abortus_] RB51.CDC advises that people who consumed raw milk or milk products from the K-Bar Dairy between 1 June 2017 and 7 August 2017, should get antimicrobial treatment to avoid the risk of lifelong, chronic infections. Initially, people with brucellosis experience fever, sweats, aches and fatigue. If not treated, _Brucella [abortus_] RB51 infection can result in long-term complications, like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, such as meningitis. RB51 can [also] cause severe illness in people with weakened immune systems and miscarriages in pregnant women.""It's very important for people who drank raw milk from this dairy to seek treatment to prevent infection with _Brucella [abortus_] RB51,"" said William Bower, M.D., team lead for the CDC group that investigates brucellosis. ""Even if people don't have any symptoms now, they can develop a chronic infection that can impact their health for years to come.""Milk from K-Bar dairy is known to have caused _Brucella_ infection in one Texas resident. An illness in a Texas woman has been linked to the dairy. Purchase records and illness reports indicate additional people in Texas and some as far away as California and North Dakota may need antimicrobials to prevent or treat infection. In Texas, raw milk is only allowed to be sold on site at the dairy. According to Texas DHSH, K-Bar dairy has been operating in compliance with state dairy laws and rules and is cooperating fully with the investigation.CDC and Texas health officials have been trying to reach people in more than 800 households known to have purchased K-Bar raw milk. Texas is following up with 170; CDC tried to contact the remaining 672 households but many did not provide contact information. Of the 485 households with contact information, CDC successfully reached 236 households. Among the 236 households, 83 percent of people were exposed to RB51 by drinking the milk. Due to incomplete contact information, CDC staff have been unable to reach about 200 households in which someone bought K-Bar milk. People who sampled the milk at the dairy or got the milk from friends or family also may not be aware of their risk. So far, CDC and Texas health officials have received reports about people who drank K-Bar milk or have symptoms consistent with brucellosis caused by RB51 in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Ohio, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.CDC recommends that anyone who drank raw milk or consumed milk products from K-Bar dairy between 1 June 2017 and 7 August 2017, see their doctor for antimicrobial treatment to prevent infection. Because brucellosis can cause complications during pregnancy, including miscarriage, it is especially important for pregnant women who may have been exposed to seek medical care. RB51 is resistant to some antimicrobials that would normally be used to prevent or treat brucellosis, so people who drank the milk should tell their doctor that they may have been exposed to RB51 and refer their healthcare provider to the CDC website (link below).People who have consumed the milk should also check themselves for fever for 4 weeks after they last drank the milk and watch for other brucellosis symptoms for 6 months. These symptoms include but are not limited to: muscle pain, lasting fatigue, arthritis, depression, and swelling of the testicles.Doctors can find more information about testing patients for RB51 and which antibiotics to use to prevent infection on the CDC website at: <https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html>.About RB51----------RB51 is a weakened strain of _B. abortus_ used to vaccinate young female cattle against infection with more serious strains of _Brucella_. Vaccinating cows with the RB51 vaccine helps prevent abortions in cows and reduces the risk of people coming into contact with cows infected with more severe strains. However, in rare cases, vaccinated cows can shed RB51 in their milk.Testing of milk from the individual cows in the dairy herd revealed 2 cows that were infected with _B. abortus_ RB51, supporting the conclusion that these cows are a source of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. Testing is ongoing by Texas officials to assure that the remaining cows in the herd do not pose an ongoing risk of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. The only way to avoid this potential exposure is to drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill the germs.Brucellosis is rare in the USA, largely due to our vaccination practices in cattle to prevent brucellosis. There are about 120 reported cases in people each year. Most cases of brucellosis in the USA occur in people who traveled to countries where brucellosis is more common and drank contaminated cow, sheep or goat milk or had contact with infected animals. Among cases in the USA who acquired brucellosis here, infections occur from contact with feral swine or, more rarely, dogs, or because of accidental exposure in lab settings.Raw Milk: a Risk for Infections-------------------------------Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs. CDC recommends that people only drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill germs. Even healthy animals may carry germs that can contaminate milk. There is no substitute for pasteurization to assure that milk is safe to drink. The risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.More info on raw milk: <https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-index.html>.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[This CDC report regarding this ongoing investigation indicates that this is likely a widespread cluster of unpasteurized milk associated, _B. abortus_ RB51, a live, attenuated vaccine strain, although ""abortus"" is not mentioned in the report. Additional cases (not previously mentioned) may have occurred in other areas of Texas as well as 6 other states so far. How many more cases in Texas or elsewhere will be found is yet to be determined. It will also be quite interesting to hear how the potentially deadly milk came to these states.This review clearly highlight the risk of unpasteurized dairy milk as a health hazard: Costard S, Espejo L, Groenendaal H, Zagmutt FJ: Outbreak-related disease burden associated with consumption of unpasteurized cow's milk and Cheese, United States, 2009-2014. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017;23(6):957-964 <https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2306.151603>:""In conclusion, outbreaks linked to the consumption of cow's milk and cheese were estimated to cause on average 761 illnesses and 22 hospitalizations per year in the USA. Unpasteurized products are consumed by a small percentage of the US dairy consumers but cause 95 percent of illnesses; the risk for illness was found to be greater than 800 times higher for consumers of unpasteurized milk or cheese than for consumers of pasteurized dairy products. Therefore, outbreak-related illnesses will increase steadily as unpasteurized dairy consumption grows, likely driven largely by salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis.""A previous report from the same journal In the March 2012 issue (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article>), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. A total of 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent). Pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.The statement that ""unpasteurized products are consumed by a small percentage of the US dairy consumers but cause 95 percent of illnesses; the risk for illness was found to be greater than 800 times higher for consumers of unpasteurized milk or cheese than for consumers of pasteurized dairy products"" underscores the need to be critical about attempts by state legislatures to liberalize laws regarding the sale or availability of unpasteurized dairy products as reported, for example, in:Montana-<http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2017/03/30/bill-label-raw-milk-related-products/99845984/>;Rhode Island-<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/03/rhode-island-bill-would-ok-retail-sales-of-unpasteurized-milk/#.WQS9bIWcFPY>; andHawaii-<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/01/hawaii-lawmakers-say-locavores-want-unpasteurized-raw-milk/#.WQS9uIWcFPY>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
