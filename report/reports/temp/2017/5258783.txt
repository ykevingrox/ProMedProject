YubaNet, Nevada County (CA) Public Health Department report [edited]<https://yubanet.com/regional/public-health-department-lake-wildwood-e-coli-update/> As of today [17 Aug 2017], there are 18 cases linked to the recent _E. coli_ O157 outbreak. Of the 18 cases, 12 are children and 6 are adults. All reported illnesses are associated with playing in the water at Commodore Beach in Lake Wildwood [Nevada county] or taking care of someone who is infected. The best method of prevention when caring for an ill person is frequent washing and drying of your hands.There have been a total of 10 hospitalizations and of those, 9 have been discharged home. To date, of those with laboratory-confirmed _E. coli_ O157, the onset of symptoms has ranged from 20-29 Jul 2017. The Public Health Department will continue to follow up on reports of illness received from health care providers.The 5 public beaches at Lake Wildwood remain closed, and the no swimming advisory remains in effect for the lake. The Environmental Health Department continues to take samples from around the lake for testing; however, the cause of the outbreak remains under investigation.The Public Health Department would like to take this opportunity to remind you not to swim in any recreational waters or pools if you are experiencing any gastrointestinal symptoms, until at least 2 weeks after your symptoms are gone. Please consult your private medical provider should you have any concerns about your health.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st report that I have seen that confirms that the _E. coli_ was indeed a enterohemorrhagic (Shiga toxin producing) strain, specifically serotype O157, the prototypic serotype.Although _E. coli_ O157 is most often associated with undercooked ground beef, or contaminated food, the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals. Swimming-associated transmission is illustrated in the references.References----------1. Keene WE, McAnulty JM, Hoesly FC, et al.
