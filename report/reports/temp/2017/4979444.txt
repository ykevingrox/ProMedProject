Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes followed by a rash that typically spreads from the head to the rest of the body.State health officials say the best way to protect yourself and your children from measles is to make sure everyone has been vaccinated with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.Measles is no longer common in the US, but is still common in many other countries and may be brought into the US by unvaccinated travelers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[An earlier report from 15 Apr 2017 on the measles cases in Minnesota stated:""Most people in Minnesota are immune to measles either from having been vaccinated or from having had the disease. However, in recent years immunization rates have declined in some communities and groups - often due to fears related to misinformation about vaccine risks, health officials say.""This decline in immunization rates increases the risk -- not only for those who are unvaccinated by choice, but also for those who cannot be vaccinated due to health status or age. Minnesota's Somali community in particular has struggled with low rates of immunization due in part to misinformation about immunization risks.""This outbreak is about unvaccinated children, not specific communities,"" said Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr Ed Ehlinger. ""Unfortunately, the Minnesota Somali community has been targeted with misinformation about vaccine risks. We're partnering with Somali community leaders and health care providers to counteract that misinformation. We want as many Minnesotans as possible to protect themselves and their families by getting vaccinated."" - Mod.LK]******[3] Nebraska (Lincoln County)Date: Tue 18 Apr 2017Source: Nebraska TV [edited]<http://nebraska.tv/news/local/second-case-of-measles-in-nebraska-confirmed-in-lincoln-county>[A 2nd case of measles in Nebraska] has been confirmed in Lincoln county, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).Measles is a highly contagious disease spread through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. DHHS is working with West Central District Health Department and health care providers to reach Nebraskans at risk for exposure and make sure they receive testing and/or vaccination if appropriate.In late March [2017], DHHS received a report of a confirmed case of measles in eastern Nebraska. State health officials are currently investigating to determine if the case in Lincoln County is linked to the earlier one.DHHS advises that anyone who experiences measles-like symptoms should see a health care provider. Those most at risk of being infected with the measles are people who have had no doses or only one dose of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine or who have not had the measles.According to DHHS, the measles vaccination is highly effective. Studies show more than 97 percent of people who receive 2 doses of vaccine are protected.Measles is not a new disease, but it's something that has not been very common in Nebraska over the last several decades. There were no measles cases in 2016, 3 in 2015, and one measles case in 2014. Prior to that, the last measles case in a Nebraska resident was in the early 1990's.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******Europe[4] PortugalDate: Sun 16 Apr 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/portugal-measles-tally-rises-10-72463/>While parts of Europe have been experiencing a large measles outbreak with thousands of cases, the situation in Portugal is not to date alarming. However, health officials reported an additional 4 cases in the past week [week of 10 Apr 2017] bringing the total cases to 10, according to an RTP Noticias report (computer translated).The newest cases were reported from Lisbon and the Algarve.Most are not vaccinated. Among the hospitalized, there are adults and children under 12 months, the age for the 1st dose of the vaccine. The vaccination coverage rate in Portugal is high, ranging from 95 to 97 percent.Measles is caused by a virus belonging to the paramyxovirus. The disease is one of the most infectious diseases that exists. Measles virus is excreted by breathing the air and spread through air droplets (aerosols). Susceptible people are infected via the respiratory tract or mucous membranes of the eyes.The incubation period is 7-18 days, usually about 10 days. At the onset, measles is acute with rapidly rising fever, eye irritation, and increasingly troublesome dry cough. After a day a red and often confluent rash occurs that is usually only seen in the face and then spreads down the trunk and extremities. Another early symptom of measles is small white spots on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots).Complications are quite common. Toddlers often suffer from respiratory problems and the infected mucous membranes may become secondarily infected with bacteria. Children can then have, for example, otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia, which often requires antibiotic treatment. Measles virus is also capable of causing pneumonia.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] Belgium, Italy, Germany: US travel advisoryDate: Mon 17 Apr 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-prompts-travel-advisory-belgium-italy-germany-71280/>Measles has been reported in increased numbers in several European countries, most notably Romania. In addition to Romania, Belgium, Italy and Germany have been affected by measles into 2017.This has prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue new travel notices for the above countries.Belgium-------Through [31 Mar 2017], Wallonia reported 266 measles cases. The outbreak affects all provinces of Wallonia, with the exception of the province of Luxembourg. All age groups are affected and 53 percent of cases are over 15 years. Most of the cases were not vaccinated or did not know their vaccination status. Nearly 40 percent were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.Italy-----Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 4 Apr 2017, Italy reported 1333 cases of measles, with 131 cases among healthcare workers. The cases are reported from 19 of the 21 regions in Italy. A majority of the cases (93 percent) are from Piedmont, Lazio, Lombardy, Tuscany, Abruzzi, and Sicily. Most of the cases are above 15 years and 88 percent of the cases were not vaccinated.Germany-------According to the German National Public Health Institute, since the beginning of 2017 and as of 12 Mar 2017, Germany reported 272 cases. In the same period in 2016, Germany reported 18 cases.CDC recommends that travelers to Belgium, Italy, and Germany protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles. Getting measles vaccine is particularly important for infants 6-11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 1 year of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of western Europe can be found at <http://bit.ly/2o1FxQs>. - Mod.LK]******Australia[6] New South Wales (Sydney)Date: Tue 18 Apr 2017Source: TEN Eyewitness News [edited]<https://tenplay.com.au/news/national/april-2017/outbreak-fears-in-western-sydney>NSW [New South Wales] Health has confirmed another person has been diagnosed with measles. It is believed he was exposed to the disease in Quakers Hill, in Western Sydney.Unfortunately, he spent time in other locations while infectious so health-care professionals are urging people to be vigilant and seek medical advice if [measles symptoms are observed].The patient was admitted to Blue Mountains Hospital on Good Friday [14 Apr 2017]. While he was infectious he visited [a number of locations listed at the source URL above].Dr Vicky Sheppeard, Director Communicable Diseases, NSW Health, said those who may have been directly exposed are being contacted.""This brings us to 22 cases of measles in NSW residents with onset in 2017. This is now 16 locally acquired cases related to the Western Sydney outbreak,"" Dr Sheppeard said. ""The latest case was exposed to measles by an earlier case at Wyndham College, Quakers Hill.""Professor Robert Booy, Head of the Clinical Research team at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance said, ""Before we had immunisation, we would have major outbreaks of measles every 2 -3 years, in which many thousands of children would be affected.""The World Health Organisation in 2014 officially declared the disease eradicated in Australia but occasionally the infection is brought here from overseas -- sparking fresh outbreaks.Treatment aims to ease symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. Options may include bed rest, plenty of fluids, paracetamol to reduce pain and fever, isolation to reduce the risk of transmission.Occasionally, measles develops into a serious disease that requires urgent treatment and, depending on your circumstances, could be life threatening.Dr Sheppeard also recommends; ""When attending your GP or the emergency department with measles symptoms, please call ahead so arrangements can be made to minimise the risk of spreading the infection to other people.""If you would like more information, please visit the NSW Health website at <http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/Measles_Factsheet.aspx>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Australia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/296>. - Mod.LK]******[7] Global transmission dynamicsDate: Sun 16 Apr 2017Source: Viruses journal [edited]<http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/9/4/82>ref: Furuse Y and Oshitani H: Global transmission dynamics of measles in the measles elimination era. Viruses 2017; 9(4): 82; doi:10.3390/v9040082----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Although there have been many epidemiological reports of the inter-country transmission of measles, systematic analysis of the global transmission dynamics of the measles virus (MV) is limited. In this study, we applied phylogeographic analysis to characterize the global transmission dynamics of the MV using large-scale genetic sequence data (obtained for 7456 sequences) from 115 countries between 1954 and 2015. These analyses reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of global transmission of the virus, especially in Australia, China, India, Japan, the UK, and the USA in the period since 1990. The transmission is frequently observed, not only within the same region but also among distant and frequently visited areas. Frequencies of export from measles-endemic countries, such as China, India, and Japan are high but decreasing, while the frequencies from countries where measles is no longer endemic, such as Australia, the UK, and the USA, are low but slightly increasing. The world is heading toward measles eradication, but the disease is still transmitted regionally and globally. Our analysis reveals that countries wherein measles is endemic and those having eliminated the disease (apart from occasional outbreaks) both remain a source of global transmission in this measles elimination era. It is therefore crucial to maintain vigilance in efforts to monitor and eradicate measles globally.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Each of these reports highlights the risk of infection with measles virus in the absence of the full series of vaccinations, even if living in a country where measles virus has been basically eliminated. Travel of infected individuals from measles-endemic areas creates a risk to all unvaccinated individuals. Because of the infectiousness of the virus and the potential for serious complications, it is crucial to public health to maintain a very high level of immunity in the population. - Mod.LK]
