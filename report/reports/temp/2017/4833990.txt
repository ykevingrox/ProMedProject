In December [2016] alone, China had 106 cases of human infections, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.While South Korea and Japan are battling their own major outbreaks, the current China outbreaks appear isolated.The virus is likely to strike in winter and spring, and farmers have in recent years ramped up measures such as cleaning regimes to prevent the disease.China has confirmed 5 bird flu outbreaks among poultry this winter, which has led to the culling of more than 175 000 birds. The most recent bird flu outbreak in poultry hit a goose farm in China's southern Hunan province, killing 1054 birds, said the Ministry of Agriculture. The local government culled 2067 more birds after the outbreak, the 5th among poultry since [October 2016].China, the world's 3rd-largest producer of broiler chickens and the 2nd-biggest consumer of poultry, has also closed some live poultry markets after people and chickens were infected by the avian flu strains.Widespread infection can lead to severe health risks and big financial losses. The last major outbreak in China was in 2013, killing 36 people and causing more than USD 6 billion in losses for the agricultural sector.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] NationalDate: Fri 10 Feb 2017 20:42 ISTSource: Business Standard [edited]<http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/bird-flu-claims-35-lives-in-chinese-province-117021001087_1.html>At least 35 people have died in China's Jiangsu province due to H7N9 avian flu in the last 3 months, official media said today [10 Feb 2017].Of the 49 people infected with flu, 21 died last month [January 2017], while 14 of the 54 people admitted for treatment in December [2016] have died, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.H7N9 has entered its peak season, and direct contact with live poultry remains the main source of infection, said Bao Changjun with provincial centre for disease control and prevention.Cold weather provides the virus with a better environment and smog makes people vulnerable to infections, Bao added.The public are advised to avoid direct contact with poultry and wear masks when symptoms such as headache, fever, coughing and chest congestion appear, the report said.H7N9 is a bird flu strain first reported to have infected humans in China in March 2013. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A sudden increase in the number of human influenza A(H7N9) cases reported has been observed during December [2016] and January [2017]. However, a greater geographic spread of the virus was observed in this 5th wave, as compared to earlier waves of infection. For cases with available exposure history, most have reported prior exposure to live poultry or potentially contaminated environments, including live poultry markets (LPMs), a feature similar to earlier waves.So far, there has been no indication of significant changes in the epidemiology of the human infections reported, no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, and no significant changes in the clinical presentation or disease outcome.Additional details about the geographical distribution in animals, population immunity, disease severity, virology, antiviral susceptibility, and transmission in animal models are available at<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/riskassessment_AH7N9_201702/en/>. - Mod.UBAMaps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
