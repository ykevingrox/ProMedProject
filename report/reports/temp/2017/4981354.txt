This patient had h/o [a history of] dog bite 1.5 months back at his village by a domestic dog and as per history given by the attendants, the dog expired 4 days after the bite. The patient was not vaccinated at all.Yesterday, 17 Apr 2017, the patient died. All the contacts of the patient and other known persons who came in contact with the dog were vaccinated by the District Health Department. District health teams are in the locality to provide awareness to the general public as well.--Mumtaz A KhanNational Institute of Health Pakistan<drmomi74@hotmail.com>[Presenting to the hospital some 6 weeks post exposure, with advanced rabies symptoms, the death of this unfortunate patient was inevitable.Some background information on the prevailing rabies handling procedures in Pakistan may be retrieved from the following excerpt, derived from a 2016 paper (Ref 1):""Most victims do not report to a health center; nor do they wash the bite wound with soap and water. Instead, they apply home remedies. Even in some large health care centers, the wound severity is not assessed correctly, and hence appropriate decisions about usage of vaccines and RIG [rabies immunoglobulin] are not made, which, in the worst case, causes rabies deaths. Moreover, Pakistan and Myanmar are the only 2 countries in the world where the obsolete nerve tissue vaccine is still produced and provided to government hospitals and clinics. In one study from Pakistan, the nerve tissue vaccine was found to have zero potency. Cell or tissue culture vaccines have long replaced nerve tissue vaccine in almost all countries of the world, as they are proven to be safe and effective. Several imported culture vaccines are available in Pakistan, yet, many institutions do not practice correct PEP either because the staff are not trained, or vaccine and RIG are not provided because they are considered 'unsafe' or 'unaffordable'.""Hopefully, the use of the obsolete nerve tissue vaccine has been discontinued since.For the location of Hassan Abdal in Punjab, Pakistan see map at <http://tinyurl.com/m59p9ub>.
