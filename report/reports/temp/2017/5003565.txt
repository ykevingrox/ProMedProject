STV [edited]<https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1387143-hepatitis-a-outbreak-allegedly-linked-to-airdrie-bakery/>An outbreak of hepatitis A in North Lanarkshire has been potentially linked to JB Christie's bakery in Airdrie. NHS Lanarkshire are currently investigating 9 confirmed cases and 9 suspected cases, where initial suggestions lead them back to the shop. Environmental health and public health staff are working with the bakery to carry out further investigations.Dr Josephine Pravinkumar, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in Public Health Medicine said: ""Our initial investigations have indicated that there may be a link between these cases and the bakery.""While the risk is very low, if anyone does experience a flu-like illness, loss of appetite, nausea, fever, abdominal pains or jaundice (a yellowing of the eyes or skin), they should contact NHS24 on 111 or their GP in the usual way.""Dr Pravinkumar continued: ""We would like to thank everyone at the bakery for helping us with the investigation to identify any possible source.""Once informed of the matter, the bakery owners took the decision to temporarily close their bakery and their 2 retail outlets in Airdrie and Coatbridge immediately and are fully cooperating with environmental health officers and public health staff. All staff at the bakery are being provided with information and support and necessary actions are being taken to prevent any further infection"".[Byline: Emma O'Neill]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The method of contamination of the bakery goods has not been established as yet. One can think that bakeries, where cooked goods are sold, would not be a source for hepatitis A but no. One report (1) with its abstract below reported transmission of HAV from someone icing pastries after they were cooked and cooled:""In a community hepatitis A outbreak in the Rochester, New York area, 64 of 79 (81 percent) people with anti-hepatitis A IgM-antibodies and onset of symptoms from 9 April-31 May 1994, recalled eating food obtained from a retail buyer's club. Eleven (65 percent) of 17 households with cases contained club members compared with 7 (21 percent) of 34 neighborhood-matched control households (matched odds ratio 8&5; 95 percent CI 1-7-41-6). Club employees who ate sugar-glazed baked goods were at fourfold increased risk for hepatitis. The source of infection was an IgM-positive baker who contaminated baked goods while applying sugar glaze. Computer-generated purchase lists implicated 11-12 March and 21-24 March as the most likely dates when contamination occurred. This investigation demonstrates the importance of food workers adhering to established hygiene practices. Computer-generated commercial datasets can be useful in epidemiologic investigations.""This paper references the classic bakery-associated HAV outbreak occurred in 1968, in West Branch, Michigan, which was traced to a baker's assistant who contaminated doughnuts while applying a sugar glaze (2). The West Branch outbreak was popularly described by Berton Roueche and later was turned into a widely used epidemiology teaching exercise (3).1.

A part of this report is reproduced below as an excellent discussion related to foodborne HAV (references can be found in the original URL):""Food items that have been described or assumed to have caused HA outbreaks include mussels, oysters, vegetables and salad fertilized with feces [5,6], fruits including raw blueberries [7], frozen raspberries [8], frozen strawberries [9], green onions [10] and shellfish [11]. Contamination of food by infected food handlers in restaurants has also been described [12]. Several HA outbreaks have been associated with bakeries [13]. In an outbreak observed in 1968 in Michigan, United States (USA), the vehicle of infection was pastries covered with glaze or icing [14]. In an outbreak in New York, US, HA was associated with sugar-glazed baked goods [15]. An HA outbreak took place in Germany in 2004 where a bakery employee most probably contaminated the products that caused the outbreak [13].The tenacity of HAV is higher than of other non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. The ability of HAV to survive on hands and on inanimate surfaces plays an important role for HAV transfer from hands of infectious persons to food items and from contaminated surfaces to fingertips [16,17]. Disinfection with alcohol and hydrogen peroxide (3 percent and 6 percent concentration) has been found ineffective against HAV on surfaces [18]. According to Mbithi, unmedicated liquid soap was ineffective for reducing virus titer on hands [18], indicating that hand washing with ordinary soap is not sufficient to prevent HAV transmission. HAV is acid-stable [19] and seems to remain viable while passing through the stomach [1]. The minimum infectious dose is estimated to be very low with 10-100 virus particles. The amount of HAV shed by infected humans ranges from 1 million to 100 million virus particles per 1 gram of stool [20,21].""Hepatitis A virus immunization for all food handlers would minimize any risk to consumers. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4097>.]
