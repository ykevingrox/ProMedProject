The establishment of the CDC is to ensure that ""we are more prepared, in terms of early detection, epidemic surveillance, training of our staff and upgrading their capacity and research so we can combat diseases of the nature of Ebola,"" Dr. Xavier Crespin, Director-General of the West Africa Health Organization, told President Akufo-Addo during a meeting at the Flagstaff House in Accra. He also said Ghana is serving as the platform for training of staff as the University of Ghana has been chosen for its Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP)].10 Mar 2017 Superspreaders are local and disproportionate<http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6329/1036.1>[Citation.

Superspreaders are local and disproportionate. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.10.1073/pnas.1614595114 (2017)Summary. Certain individuals, known as superspreaders, disproportionately infect more people with disease-causing organisms than the average infectious case. Lau et al. identified key drivers of Ebola virus (EBOV) superspreading during the 2014 West Africa outbreak. Unexpectedly, secondary cases largely did not transmit tertiary cases; thus, epidemic growth was fueled and sustained by a few superspreaders, and transmission occurred locally, within 2.5 km of the source. Community-based EBOV cases progressed more rapidly than those identified in clinical care settings. The most infectious age groups tended to be the young or people over 45 years old, which may reflect social structure, such as the intimacy of care needs, or immunological factors. This work helps to identify the most vulnerable groups and provide parameters for control efforts in future outbreaks of EBOV.]9 Mar 2017: Nova program on ""Surviving Ebola""<http://whro.org/tv/46618-nva-srvng-ebl>[Wed 22 Mar 2017: Ebola is one of the most deadly viruses on earth, but that didn't stop relief workers on the frontlines.

To protect nonhuman primates, and to prevent EVD from spilling over into human populations, scientists have now developed an oral vaccine to combat EVD in the wild. While it appears to be promising, the researchers have run into legal, political, and ethical obstacles that could make it difficult to push the research further.Ingestible vaccines are nothing new, but this marks the 1st time that scientists have developed one specifically for the purpose of protecting and preserving wild nonhuman primates. This new vaccine, should it ever be put to use, would indirectly help humans by reducing the risk of EVD taking root in nonhuman primate populations, from where it could spread to humans.[Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Thomas Jefferson University embarked on a project to evaluate] a promising Ebola vaccine called filorab1. By combining it with an inactive version of the rabies virus, the researchers were able to create an oral version of the vaccine. The disabled rabies virus allows the Ebola vaccine to pass more easily into the bloodstream when ingested, triggering a robust immune response.Over the past 3 decades, EVD has killed about 1/3rd of the world's gorillas and countless chimpanzees. EVD threatens wild nonhuman primates that are already at risk, be it from habitat loss or rampant poaching.][The major hurdle to the project is conducting field trials in the NHP with Ebola challenge to test the efficacy of the approach. - Mod.LK]12 Mar 2017: Ebola vaccines provide immune responses after 1 year: JAMA <http://speciality.medicaldialogues.in/ebola-vaccines-provide-immune-responses-after-1-year/>[Immune responses to Ebola vaccines at one year after vaccination are examined in a new study appearing in the 14 Mar 2017 JAMA][The Ebola virus vaccine strategies evaluated by the World Health Organization in response to the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa included a heterologous primary and booster vaccination schedule of the adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Tai Forest viruses nucleoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo). These vaccines both used a ""viral-vector"" approach, where a benign virus is modified to safely express key proteins of the target virus, in this case Ebola. This schedule has been shown to induce immune responses that persist for 8 months after primary immunization, with 100 percent of vaccine recipients retaining Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific antibodies. A vaccine that provides durable immune responses is important in maintaining sustained protection against disease, both during outbreaks and outside of an outbreak for at-risk populations.]Research-------Feb 2017 West Africa: West African Ebola Virus Strains: Unstable and Ready to Invade? <http://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/pdf/S1931-3128(17)30079-3.pdf>[Citation.

Ordaz-Nemeth I., Arandjelovic M., Boesch l., et al. (10 Mar 2017). The socio-economic drivers of bushmeat consumption during the West African Ebola crisis. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005450>Abstract. Bushmeat represents an important source of animal protein for humans in tropical Africa. Unsustainable bushmeat hunting is a major threat to wildlife, and its consumption is associated with an increased risk of acquiring zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola virus disease (EVD). During the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa, it is likely that human dietary behavior and local attitudes toward bushmeat consumption changed in response to the crisis, and that the rate of change depended on prevailing socio-economic conditions, including wealth and education. In this study, we therefore investigated the effects of income, education, and literacy on changes in bushmeat consumption during the crisis, as well as complementary changes in daily meal frequency, food diversity and bushmeat preference. More specifically, we tested whether wealthier households with more educated household heads decreased their consumption of bushmeat during the EVD crisis, and whether their daily meal frequency and food diversity remained constant. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyze interview data from two nationwide household surveys across Liberia. We found an overall decrease in bushmeat consumption during the crisis across all income levels. However, the rate of bushmeat consumption in high-income households decreased less than in low-income households. Daily meal frequency decreased during the crisis, and the diversity of food items and preferences for bushmeat species remained constant. Our multidisciplinary approach to study the impact of EVD can be applied to assess how other disasters affect social-ecological systems and improve our understanding and the management of future crises.]11 Mar 2017: Aerial medical evacuation of health workers with suspected Ebola virus disease in Guinea Conakry - interest of a negative pressure isolation pod - a case series<http://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12873-017-0121-x>[Citation.

BMC Emergency Medicine, DOI: 10.1186/s12873-017-0121-xAbstract. We report 4 cases of Health Workers (HW) suspected of having contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD), transported from the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in N'Zerekore, Guinea to the Treatment Center for Carers run by the medical corps of the French army in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, which was established on 17 Jan 2015 and closed on 7 Jul 2015. In total, more than 500 HWs have died from EVD since the epidemic began. This mortality has had significant effects on the ability of local services to respond appropriately to the disaster. The HWs were transported by air in the ""Human Stretcher Transit Isolator-Total Containment (Oxford) Limited"" (HSTI-TCOL) negative-pressure isolation pod. Medical evacuation of patients with suspected, potentially fatal, infectious diseases is feasible with the use of a light isolator for patients without critical dysfunctions.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map showing the distribution of EVD cases as of 27 Mar 2016 can be seen at <http://apps.who.int/ebola/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sitrep_casecount_40.png>. - Mod.LKProMED HealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>][See Also:Ebola update (10): news, research 20170305.4881172Ebola update (09): news, research, funding 20170226.4866142Ebola update (08): news, research, vaccine 20170219.4850524Ebola update (07): research, economy 20170213.4836546Ebola update (06): research, treatment, funding 20170206.4819835Ebola update (05): news, vaccine, funding, documentary films 20170129.4801064Ebola update (04): research 20170123.4786222Ebola update (03): news, research 20170115.4767977Ebola update (02): news, research, vaccine, comment 20170108.4750411Ebola update (01): News, research, vaccine 20170103.47380602016----Ebola update (72): vaccine, research, NGO, media 20161226.4724859Ebola update (71): research, economy 20161218.4706276Ebola update (70): news, research, economy, funding 20161211.4690740Ebola update (69): news, NGO, research, economy, funding, vaccine 20161204.4675615Ebola update (68): news, economy 20161127.4657148Ebola update (67): news, research, funding 20161120.4642402Ebola update (66): news, research, funding, economy 20161115.4629793Ebola update (65): news, research, commentary, economy, funding, vaccine 20161106.4609611Ebola update (64): news, research 20161030.4595759Ebola update (63): news, research 20161023.4579436Ebola update (62): news, research, treatment, funding 20161017.4564066Ebola update (61): news, funding, economy 20161009.4547627Ebola update (60): news, research, economy 20161002.4531285Ebola update (59): news, research, funding 20160925.4514591Ebola update (58): news, research, funding, vaccine 20160918.4497393Ebola update (57): news, research, funding 20160911.4481043Ebola update (56): news, vaccine, research 20160904.4465145Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266].................................................lk/msp/dk"
