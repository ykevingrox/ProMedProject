According to the Health ministry, the officers are said to have been infected after taking meals at the Nairobi Area Police Canteen.On [Sun 3 Sep 2017], some 59 officers were hospitalised in various hospitals in Nairobi with another 36 admitted [Mon 4 Sep 2017], after contracting the disease. They were part of a group of 430 officers deployed to Nairobi ahead of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential poll petition on [Fri 1 Sep 2017]. They were residing at the Multimedia University Hotel in Rongai, about 17 kilometers [10.6 mi] south of the capital.""Those infected did not get the disease from the Multimedia University since they had their lunch away from the institution. Investigations show that the source is the Nairobi Area Police Canteen,"" said Dr Ralph Muli, the Nairobi County head of Diseases Surveillance. Consequently, the City has temporarily closed the canteen.The Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the officers were in stable condition. Dr Mailu said investigations were underway to establish whether the canteen had outsourced services to cater for the large number of officers. He said the ministry was concerned that instead of eliminating cholera, new cases were emerging.Nairobi was first hit by the outbreak on 19 May 2017, with 56 cases having been reported.One of the police officers who requested anonymity said they ate ugali (a Kenyan staple made of maize flour) and meat stew at the canteen on [Sat 2 Sep 2017].

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.""The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).""In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).""References-----------57.
