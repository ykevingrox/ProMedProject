CNN [edited]<http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/08/health/fresh-express-salad-bat-cdc/index.html>Two people were recommended for post-exposure rabies treatment after a consumer in Florida reported finding a dead bat in a packaged salad mix, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said [on Sat 8 Apr 2017]. The bat was sent to CDC after it was found in a bag of Fresh Express Organic Marketside Spring Mix.""The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies,"" the Atlanta-based agency said. CDC said the risk of rabies transmission was extremely low but not zero, so the 2 people who ate salad mix were recommended for treatment as a precaution. They are fine and show no signs of having rabies, said CDC.Fresh Express has recalled packages of the salad mix that were sold at Walmarts in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The affected product has the production code G089B19 and best-if-used-by date of [14 Apr 2017] on the front label, and UPC code 6 8113132897 5 on the bottom of the container.""Upon receiving notification, both Walmart and Fresh Express food safety and rapid response teams, in close coordination with regulatory authorities, acted immediately to review all relevant records, launch an intensive investigation, and initiate product removal and recall procedures,"" Fresh Express said.There have been no other reports of animal matter. The Florida Department of Health, US Food and Drug Administration and CDC are part of the investigation into the dead bat.[byline: Steve Almasy]--communicated by:Dee Hadorn<bluemohair@gmail.com>[An abundance of caution clearly indicates post exposure prophylaxis is recommended. A bat in the salad is beyond the so called 'yuck' factor. It is positively nauseating!A recall of the product is completely warranted and understandable as is an investigation into how a bat could have gotten into the package. It calls into question the sanitation of the prepackaged food. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.].................................................tg/mj/sh"
