and- environmental exposure.Challenges----------- Establishing a full list of all attendees from outside and within Sinoe county who participated in the funeral events.- Further laboratory testing is still ongoing to identify other potential causative agents of event.- Inadequate disclosure of information related to the funeral event by family members and residents in Sinoe county.- Lack of motivational package for community health volunteers (CHVs) involved with contact tracing & interpersonal communication.Public health actions---------------------Coordination- the national level National Epidemic Preparedness and Response Committee meets regularly to provide guidance and support to Sinoe CHT [County Health Team];- the national level team is coordinating with the Montserrado CHT on follow up of people who participated at the funeral in Greenville;- the health system remains resilient as people are still visiting the hospital normally to receive care; and- in addition, all clinics remain opened with encouraging turn out while the implementation of African vaccines campaign ongoing.Surveillance and contact tracing- active case search ongoing in the affected and circumscribed communities in Sinoe county and follow of people who participated in the funeral in other counties;- outbreak case definition developed to facilitate active case search;- data from field investigations being analyzed to inform further laboratory tests;- investigation and compilation of outbreak line list for all cases including contacts; and- surveillance has been heightened at district and community levels including community engagement and sensitization.Case management- case management of patients currently admitted at the FJ Grante Hospital is ongoing;

3 urine specimens were tested at Redemption Hospital laboratory, the results were variable and therefore it was not possible to deduce any pattern; 1 rectal swab testing ongoing, preliminary results to be shared as soon as available;- toxicological investigations: aliquots 11 specimens shipped to CDC-Atlanta for toxicological testing; efforts continuing to send samples to South Africa (WHO) and France (MSF) for further testing;- water (tested in-country, in Sinoe): water samples tested negative for coliforms; and- food sampling: food (cake, sugar, seasons, powder milk, garlic, pepper) samples collected and preserved at National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for further analysis.Dead body management- except for the corpse in Monrovia, all dead bodies were safely disposed by the burial team in Sinoe county;

The good news is that there have been no new cases, suggesting that the disease is not transmissible. It will be interesting to learn what the toxicological tests done at CDC might reveal. Those results are awaited with interest.Maps of Liberia can be accessed at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/liberia/li2r765a/liberia_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41137>. - Mod.TY]
