Fields related to the final status of the case are updated as information is available.NA = Not availableDate of notification to WHO / Reporting country / City of residence / Age / Sex / Health care worker / Comorbidities / Exposure to camels / Camel milk consumption / Exposure to MERS-CoV cases / Date of symptoms onset / Date of 1st hospitalization / Date of laboratory confirmation / Status29 Jul 2017 / United Arab Emirates / Al Ain / 54 / M / No / No / NA / NA / No / 11 Jul 2017 / 25 Jul 2017 / AliveThe patient, who lives and works in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, presented at a hospital in Al Ain on [16 Jul 2017]. On [16 Jul 2017], a chest X-ray showed pneumonia and he was treated with antibiotics and non-invasive ventilation. On [25 Jul 2017], his symptoms worsened and a sputum sample was collected and tested for MERS-CoV and influenza. On [26 Jul 2017], showing no signs of improvement, the patient was transferred to a 2nd hospital in Al Ain and placed in an intensive care unit.A 2nd sputum sample was collected on [26 Jul 2017] and both samples tested positive for MERS-CoV on [27 Jul 2017]. The patient is currently in ICU on mechanical ventilation. Investigations into the source of infection are ongoing. At the time of writing the results of the investigation were not yet provided to WHO.Globally, 2067 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 720 related deaths have been reported to WHO.Public health response----------------------The Ministry of Health in Abu Dhabi carried out contact tracing and followed up 89 health care workers and 95 contacts at his place of employment. All identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure. No additional cases were detected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[I have been unable to find additional information on both official sources as well as unofficial sources of information related to the case described in the UAE in the above WHO report. Of note is that the event (identification of a MERS-CoV infected individual) actually occurred a month ago -- the date of report of this case to WHO was 29 Jul 2017, with the date of onset of symptoms 11 Jul 2017 and date of positive laboratory testing for MERS-CoV of 25 Jul 2017. Information on results of contact tracing continuing until 14 days following last known contact with the case (one incubation period) was available for all contacts. Hence, this is a nice historical archive of identification of a sporadic case of MERS-CoV infection, although the information on the investigation of possible high risk exposures of the actual case is not available at present.This is now the 5th case of MERS-CoV infection identified in the UAE this year, with 2 previous cases in May 2017 from Al Ain, and 2 additional previous cases from Abu Dhabi reported in April 2017, bringing the total number of cases reported by the UAE since 2012 up to 84.Al Ain is a major inland city of the UAE, belonging to the Abu Dhabi emirate (see <https://www.mapsofworld.com/united-arab-emirates/maps/united-arab-emirates-cities-map.jpg>).The HealthMap/ProMED map of the United Arab Emirates is available at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/132>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia, 7 new cases - Saudi MOH 19-29 Aug 2017Date: Tue 29 Aug 2017Source: Saudi MOH 19-29 Aug 2017 [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx?PageIndex=1>As of [Tue 29 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:1708 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including688 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.3 percent],997 recoveries, and22 currently active cases/infections.[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections.

Note that there was a recovery reported in a 44-year-old expat female on 15 Aug 2017, suggesting either this is a duplicate report or there was a 2nd 44 year old expat female from Jeddah reported that did not appear on the newly confirmed case reports on the Saudi MOH website. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the 11 day period since the last update, there have been 7 newly confirmed cases reported of whom 5 were from Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region), the location that had nosocomial transmission identified since the beginning of this past month [July 2017]. Clearly transmission is continuing in this area, with 3 newly confirmed secondary cases in household contacts - at least 2 of whom were identified through screening of asymptomatic household contacts, and 2 additional cases in which high risk exposures are still under investigation. We do not know if these household contacts are associated with the earlier identified transmission chain in Dawmat Aljandal or if these are newly identified chains of transmission. The other 2 newly confirmed cases involve ""sporadic"" cases - an individual in Hail whose high risk exposure history is still under investigation, and an individual from Alaflaj (Riyadh region) with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.As to be expected, concern is being voiced on the international level with the upcoming Hajj and this recent increase in cases reported both in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE. We now have gone through 5 Hajj periods since the identification of the MERS-CoV and to date there have been no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in returning Hajjis. The case in the UAE (see section [1] above) actually had onset of illness over 1 month ago with no secondary cases/infections identified among known contacts of this case. As for the cases in Saudi Arabia, and more specifically the Hajj, population movement is very well defined during the Hajj, no camels are permitted in the areas where Hajjis are congregated, and there are Hajj specific health services that are separate from those that are available for the general Saudi population, all factors that are reducing the likelihood of Hajjis having inadvertent (or intentional) high risk exposures. Hopefully my optimism is well placed and we will pass through a 6th Hajj period without impact on international transmission of the MERS-CoV associated with this Hajj.Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the reported cases, fatality and recoveries  can be found at the given URL's.
