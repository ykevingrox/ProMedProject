Bangs <mbangs@fmi.com> [edited]It stands to reason that the presence of _Anopheles farauti_ as the new entrant into New Caledonia is presumably recent. The nearest neighbor is Vanuatu, a malaria-endemic country that has but one anopheline species present in that island group, _Anopheles farauti_ sensu stricto, an effective malaria vector provided you add _Plasmodium_ to the mix._Anopheles farauti_ is one member of 8 known sibling species in the _Farauti_ Complex (closely related species that are morphologically identical, thus confounding accurate identification without the use of molecular techniques). It is by far the most widely distributed species in the complex in the southwest Pacific region (Maluku island group, eastern Indonesia to northern Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). The species' ability to inhabit brackish water environments (predominantly a coastal inhabitant) has aided in its dispersal throughout the region.The origin of the anopheline population in New Caledonia might remain a mystery, but this discovery is of concern. If the area of establishment is relatively confined, it might be possible to eliminate this species before it extends further into the country. Foremost, identify the species.--Michael J.

One hopes that the area of discovery is small enough to permit control.Maps of New Caledonia can be accessed at <https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/93/3293-004-8AA31F9B.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/459>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Invasive mosquito - New Caledonia 20170830.5283276].................................................dk/ty/msp/dk"
