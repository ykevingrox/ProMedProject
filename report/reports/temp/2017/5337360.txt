They said Shah had complained of a fever and headache and initially avoidedgetting treated, but was compelled to get admitted at the LNH when his condition worsened.Sindh Health Department officials confirmed that Congo fever had claimed 6 lives in the country this year [2017]: up to 4 Quetta residents died at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) and one Karachi resident each at the South City Hospital and the LNH.This September [2017] has proved to be the deadliest month of the year as regards Congo fever: up to 2 Karachi residents and one from Quetta died at hospitals in the city, while around a dozen more were admitted to different health facilities after testing positive for the CCHF virus.A couple of days ago a 30-year-old man, a resident of Adam Town in DHA Phase-I near Azam Basti, had died at the South City Hospital due to Congo fever after contracting the CCHF virus from a goat brought to Karachi from Hub tehsil of Balochistan's Lasbela district.[AK] from Quetta died at the AKUH on [Wed 13 Sep 2017], 60-year-old [PMG] from Quetta's Satellite Town on [Sun 13 Sep 2017], 25-year-old [NM] on Sat 13 May 2017] and 15-year-old [SAK] from Satellite Town on [Sun 9 Apr 2017].Congo fever is a highly contagious disease with a mortality rate of at least 40 percent. The CCHF bug often infects people who deal with livestock and cattle, as the tick carrying the deadly bug is often found on such animals.The health department's official record states that around 50 people tested positive for CCHF this year [2017] after they were brought to various hospitals in the metropolis, of which 6 died and the remaining were discharged following full recovery.The health authorities said that majority of the Congo fever cases were brought in from Quetta and most of the patients were Satellite Townresidents, adding that all of them were engaged in trade, transportation, slaughtering and dealing of cattle in Balochistan and Karachi.Gastroenterologist Dr Shahid Ahmed explains that CCHF is caused by a tick that is locally known as ""chichri"", which attaches itself to the bodies of cattle and dogs. ""When a healthy person comes into contact with the infected animal, its blood or any other secretion, the virus infects the healthy person and makes him sick.""Ahmed says CCHF is a highly lethal and contagious disease that causes high-grade fever, extreme headaches and bleeding from the nose, gums and internal organs and in urine, as the platelets of the affected persons drop rapidly.""Awareness is the key to prevent contracting this disease, and people should be made aware that this disease can be avoided by adopting some precautionary measures. ""The government should arrange spraying pesticides for sacrificial and other cattle so that lives of people dealing with livestock could be saved.""The province's health authorities have also been focusing on counseling for family members of people who have fallen victim to Congo fever. Following the death of [NK] in DHA Phase 1, a team of the Sindh health department led by District Officer (Preventive) Dr Kamran Rizvi had visited the family of the victim to inquire about their health and to verify whether any of them were developing symptoms associated with the deadly disease.[Byline: M. Waqar Bhatti]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 2nd fatal case of CCHF from Karachi Sindh in 2017, while in 2016, there were 11 reported deaths in the province [Promed Mail post; Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (25): (SD) new case 20161101.4598918]. CCHF is essentially spread through direct contact with blood or body fluids from infected animals and human cases as well as through bites from infected ticks. Therefore public education about preventive measures must be emphasized to reduce risky exposures and practices. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/707>.]
