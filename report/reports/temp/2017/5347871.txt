It is called Safe Contained Poultry Slaughter (SCOPS) and uses large pots or a bucket to capture the viral plume during the death struggle of the bird so that virus-laden aerosols are greatly reduced or eliminated. The program is designed for outreach to village-level women who do home slaughter and the outreach tool is easily altered to fit whatever area or culture is being addressed.By using schools and teaching children who then take home [a flyer given to them at school], to teach their mothers, rapid dissemination of the [guidelines addressing] slaughter was accomplished. Additionally there were more than 1000 meetings and seminars held for adult attendees.The 2 published posters/flyers illustrate the slaughter technique (11 panels) and then reiterate the most important steps (5 panels). For the flyers, the 2 illustrations were printed back-to-back on one sheet so that what is taken home has both sets of illustrations.The posters are very visual in design and meant for limited literacy audiences so that the technique is clear to everyone regardless of educational background, i.e. there is no writing on the 11-step (although there is a version with writing available) and writing on the 5-step (and there is a version with no writing available).Implementation of this outreach program is very straightforward and the posters can be easily translated where writing is needed or wanted. Also, clothing, facial features, and skin color can be altered to fit the nation/area and culture.--Andrew A. Clark, DVMInternational Veterinary ConsultantPendleton, OR 97801 U.S.A.<andrewaclark1940@gmail.com>[Dr Clark is acknowledged for his observations and for the examples of public education in Egypt concerning preventive measures during traditional home-slaughter of poultry.FAO Regional Office for Near East and North Africa, situated in Cairo, published on 1 Feb 2016 a description of its anti-Avian influenza outreach campaign (see at <http://www.fao.org/neareast/news/view/en/c/386133/>). It is herewith summarized:""Launched by the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) in November 2015, the Exposure Reduction Program (ERP) has proved a tangible success, raising awareness among households regarding the risks linked to the traditional Egyptian household poultry-slaughter and promoting safer manual bird-slaughter steps across Egypt.The launched ERP encourages safe/contained poultry slaughter in covered pots (Halla). The objective is to protect individuals who slaughter poultry in the household sector and also to protect the people around them, who are usually women and children, from exposure to the high pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI), which can be transmitted during the manual slaughter of an apparently healthy but infected bird that is not yet showing symptoms.Sohair Abel Kader, National Consultant to the program, commented: ""We researched the fact that women and children were the categories most affected by avian flu in Egypt and found that traditional manual slaughter as practiced in Egyptian homes is a main risk factor."" She added: ""The scientific research conducted on this issue proved that containing the bird in a covered pot for a few minutes immediately after slaughter, specifically till the completion of death struggle, protects those who carry out the slaughter and others around them."" Abel Kader said the 10 steps recommended by the FAO program require no special skills and are not costly, as every house has a Halla (pot) with cover, which can be washed with soap and water and is the main instrument needed for safe slaughter. She expressed optimism about the initial response to the campaign by Egyptian citizens.The campaign's outreach field staff is formed from rural community health care workers (Raidat Reefiat) from the Ministry of Health and Population and the awareness campaign's professional veterinarians from both extension vets and community animal health and outreach (CAHO) vets, from the General Organization of Veterinary Services, representing the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation.""HPAI H5N1 circulation in Egypt reportedly started in March 2006; it was declared endemic in poultry since 2008 while human cases have been reported yearly. As of March 2017 a total of 359 human infections with, at least, 123 deaths have been registered. The disease, in both poultry and in humans, peaks during the cold season (November-March). Last human case was observed on 9 Apr 2017 in Cairo Governorate.Indonesia reported, between 2005 and 2015, 199 human HPAI H5N1 cases, of which 167 were fatal. No human case has been reported between 2015 and the single fatal case reported recently, which brings the total to 200 cases, 168 of them fatal. The country is endemic for the disease in poultry and, so far, in 2017, 115 H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in poultry were detected in 17 provinces. It may be assumed that the number of human cases in Indonesia is under reported. It is less likely, though not excluded, that human fatalities remain unnoticed.Information on the measures undertaken in Indonesia to reduce human infection with HPAI H5N1, on top of the vaccination of poultry, from FAO, WHO and/or other, national or international agencies and NGO's, is anticipated.Globally, from January 2003 to September 2017, there were 859 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus reported from 16 countries worldwide, led by Egypt and Indonesia. Of these cases, 453 were fatal, resulting in a global CFR of 52.7 percent. - Mod.AS][Even though human cases of avian influenza A/H5N1 have been consistently reported since 1997 when it first surfaced, the pandemic potential and its impending threat are compounded by the opportunities for circulation and re-assortment in human hosts leading to a virus that can transmit robustly between humans. So far that has not happened, but the continued and perhaps unnoticed cases in humans require vigilance, ongoing surveillance, and capacity for laboratory diagnosis. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/184>.][See Also:2016----Avian influenza, human (63): Egypt, H5N1 20161013.4554039Avian influenza, human (62): Indonesia, H5N1 sero-prevalence 20161009.4547262Avian influenza, human (56): Egypt, H5N1 20160727.4370398 Avian influenza, human (40): Egypt (FY), H5N1, comments 20170402.4939591Avian influenza, human (27): Egypt (Fayoum) H5N1, RFI 20170227.4866795 2015----Avian influenza, human (94): Egypt, FAO update H5N1 20150421.3310680Avian influenza, human (89): WHO update, Egypt, H5N1 20150409.3287821Avian influenza, human (79): Egypt FAO update, Indonesia (BT) H5N1 20150330.3265901Avian influenza, human (78): Indonesia (BT) RFI, Egypt (SJ) H5N1 20150329.3263924Avian influenza, human (71): Egypt, ECDC update, H5N1 20150314.32308122013----Avian influenza, human (49): Egypt (DK) H5N1, fatal 20130417.1652529].................................................arn/ec/ml/uba/ml"
