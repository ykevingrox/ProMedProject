The China Post [edited]<http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2017/06/07/498417/get-vaccinated!.htm>Health authorities have confirmed this year's [2017] 1st case of German measles [rubella] in Taiwan.According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), a 34-year-old man from Northern Taiwan complained of headaches, coughing, and rashes after returning from a language course from the Philippines on [4 Jun 2017].Doctors later diagnosed the man with German measles.Authorities are now contacting over 60 people that the man may have come into contact with, including friends, family members, and passengers aboard the Eva Air flight (BR-272) he took to return to Taiwan.Currently none of those contacted have developed symptoms of the virus.CDC officials say that the man traveled to the Philippines on 11 Mar [2017] and started to experience coughing on 27 May [2017], while experiencing headaches and rashes 2 days later. Local doctors diagnosed the man with measles.The man boarded the flight bound for Taiwan believing he was no longer ill, but chose to wear a surgical mask as a precaution.Health authorities say that because the [German] measles' infection period (22 May-5 Jun 2017) had almost run its course and that the man had worn a surgical mask, the possibility of further infection in Taiwan was remote.The CDC will continue monitoring the man's health conditions until [25 Jun 2017].The CDC said that over 95 percent of Taiwanese citizens are immune to German measles through previous infection or vaccinations, and that most physical reactions to the virus are mild.But the measles are a threat to unborn babies when they are contracted by the mother.Possible side effects in fetuses include deafness, glaucoma, cataracts, other congenital defects, stillbirths, and spontaneous abortion.Authorities issued a reminder that women of childbearing age should be vaccinated against the [German] measles. Local clinics offer vaccines free of charge for German measles, measles and mumps.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Rubella (German measles) is a contagious disease caused by a virus [family Togaviridae, genus _Rubivirus_]. Most people who get rubella usually have a mild illness, with symptoms that can include a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Rubella can cause a miscarriage or serious birth defects in an developing baby if a woman is infected while she is pregnant. The best protection against rubella is MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine.The virus continues to circulate widely, especially in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Southeast Asian regions. Last year (2016), a cumulative total of 4 rubella cases were confirmed in Taiwan, including 1 indigenous case and 3 imported cases from India, Hong Kong and China.(Excerpted from <http://outbreaknewstoday.com/taiwan-reports-imported-rubella-case-traveler-philippines-16406/> which contains a good map of Taiwan.) - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>.]
