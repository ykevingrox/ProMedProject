The full report and then a comment:""Police in Sinoe County, southeastern Liberia, are investigation the mysterious death of 9 persons after a repass of one late Edwin Dunbar, former Proprietor of One Family Entertainment Center who died a few weeks ago in Greenville following a 2-night wake keeping.""According to our contact, those who died mysteriously include 5 females and 4 males, our contact said specimens from the 9 deceased have been taken to Buchanan, Grand Bassa County for testing to establish the actual cause of death.""As a result of this terrible incident, officers of the Liberia National Police have been deployed in the streets of Greenville using megaphones and requesting those who ate [attended?] the repass to report themselves.""Our contact said the strange and disturbing situation has created panic among citizens of the County, with others leaving for their towns and villages for fear of the unexpected.""County Health Officer John Logan when asked by our contact to speak on this prevailing situation, as to what is responsible for the mysterious deaths declined to comment on the issue.""At the same time according to our contact, the Police are encouraging citizens not to panic because many believe it is the return of the deadly Ebola virus disease. The dead have been deposited at the Francis J Grant Memorial Hospital in Greenville. ""When contacted, Sinoe Superintendent Prosperous Browne told our reporter that he was in a tight meeting and could not comment on the report, but promised to speak subsequently with GNN-Liberia.""""Repass"" sounds like a misspelling of ""repast,"" a meal. If all the cases had attended a funeral meal for Mr. Dunbar, that suggests food poisoning. But if this was a traditional West African funeral, with touching and kissing of the corpse, the possibility of a new Ebola outbreak can't be ruled out.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall*******[2]Date: Wed 26 Apr 2017, 10:55 AM EDTSource: Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-liberia-idUSKBN17S22R>Liberian health authorities are taking rapid precautionary steps after 8 people died of a mystery illness, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Wed 26 Apr 2017], 10 months after the end of a catastrophic 2-year Ebola virus outbreak.Liberian authorities said initial scientific investigations ruled out Ebola as the cause of the deaths.""Yesterday WHO received a report from Liberia health authorities about a cluster of unexplained illness and deaths in the southern part of the country - Sinoe County,"" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in emailed comments.""According to this report, since [Mon 24 Apr 2017], 14 people have fallen sick; 8 people have died and 6 are seriously ill and still in the hospital.""He gave no indication of what might have caused the deaths but said specimens from 7 bodies had been sent to the national laboratory for testing.

It is a relief to learn that Ebola virus disease has been ruled out in preliminary tests. This report and others that have come to ProMED-mail do not provide sufficient information on case histories and symptoms to permit speculation about the possible etiological agent and its possible transmissibility responsible for these fatalities. ProMED would welcome addition information about these cases, and any new ones, as it become available.Similar reports have been received from ProMED-mail Corr.
