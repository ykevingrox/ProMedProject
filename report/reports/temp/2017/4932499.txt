The Villager [edited]<http://www.thevillager.co.uk/ news/15185151.Toxic_algae_ invades_the_Queen_s_lakes/>Dog owners are being advised not to let their animals jump into the lakes and ponds at Windsor Great Park after a toxic blue-green algae started to appear.A spokesperson for Windsor Great Park said: ""Blue-green algae is a toxic, but naturally occurring algae, which blooms in warm, dry weather. It presents a danger when ingested. Following the recent milder weather, Windsor Great Park has been affected by blue-green algae in Obelisk Pond (Englefield Green), Wick Pond (Egham) and, now also, Virginia Water Lake.""The spokesman said that signs had been put up in affected areas warning visitors about the algae and advising them not to allow their dogs to enter the water. He said measures had been implemented, including the use of barley straw extract to break down the algae.He added: ""We continue to monitor the waters. However, the most effective treatment for the removal of blue-green algae is a period of cold or wet weather.""[Byline: Francis Batt]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Blue-green algae or cyanobacteria are a type of microscopic, algae-like bacteria that inhabit freshwater, coastal, and marine waters.Facts about cyanobacteria:- the algae occur naturally but can increase rapidly during warmer months;- if the water is cloudy, discoloured, or has small globules suspended in it, avoid all contact;- not all cyanobacterial blooms are visible to the naked eye, and toxins can persist after the blooms disappear;- cyanobacterial concentrations can change quickly with changing environmental conditions (such as wind). A health warning is in place; contact with the water should be avoided.The main effects of blue-green algae blooms are deterioration of water quality and production of toxins by some species. Exposure to algal toxins has been linked to fatalities of livestock, wildlife and pets.The toxins most frequently cause liver damage, and recreational use of the water should be suspended, as liver damage in human beings is also a consequence of toxic algae.Generally, dilution from the rain will cause the nutrient level to drop and return the body of water to normal. The algae will persist until the nutrient levels drop, either from rain, or until the nutrients are consumed. This has been known to last for long periods, months sometimes. Authorities should sample and the test the water for the presence of algae and toxins regularly. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279>.]
