StarrFM Online [edited]<http://starrfmonline.com/2017/04/05/meningitis-cause-of-kumaca-deaths-not-food-poisoning-reg-minister/>The Ashanti regional Minister, Simon Osei Mensah has revealed that the 4 students who died at the Kumasi Academy in the Ashanti region died from meningitis and not food poisoning. The 4 students died over a 10-day period with colleague students and parents of the deceased suspecting the cause of death to be food poisoning. Terrified students abandoned academic work and fled the campus for fear of suffering a similar fate. But after an autopsy conducted on the bodies of the students, it has been revealed that they did not die from food poisoning.Addressing a press conference [Wed 5 Apr 2017], Mr. Osei stated that through collaboration between the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and doctors from the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, ""the cause of the deaths has been identified as meningitis"". He added that 26 more cases have been identified and health officials have intensified surveillance to contain the disease and prevent further outbreak.Authorities of the school are currently putting in place measures to decongest some of the dormitories in order to contain the spread of the disease.Meningitis is usually caused by bacteria or viruses, but can be a result of injury, cancer, or certain drugs. The type of meningitis is, however, yet to be identified as the doctors conduct further tests.[Byline: Kobina Welsing]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2]Date: 7 Apr 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [Edited]Meningitis outbreak in Ghana is not only in the Ashanti region, rather also in Upper East region of Ghana that 58 people have dies within 13 weeks.

No case has been detected after the 31 March 2017. The Ashanti Region, where the outbreak has occurred, is outside the Africa meningitis belt and thus there is low index of suspicion among attending clinicians. The last two outbreaks in this region occurred in 2008 and 2011. Authorities believe there could be more undetected cases and thus surveillance activities have been intensified. Authorities have warned of possible misdiagnosis of meningitis cases as upper respiratory tract infection or malaria. The immediate setting of the outbreak (boarding high school) presents many surveillance challenges: High School sick bays do not usually have the capacity to handle such cases and therefore refer them. However, referrals are to parents/guardians and not health facilities. Information on the causative pathogen will be available in 2 - 3 days time. The Ghana EPI routinely vaccinates against _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib). Routine vaccination with _Neisseria meningitidis_ (MenAfriVac) was scheduled to start in November, 2016. The EPI has vaccinated high risk population with MenAfriVac in the past.--EpiCore Global Surveillance MemberDaniel Amoako-SakyiSenior LecturerSchool of Medical SciencesUniversity Cape Coast, Ghana[Maps of Ghana can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Ghana.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/50377>. The Ashanti Region is located in south Ghana and is 3rd largest of 10 administrative regions, with a population of about 3.6 million residents in 2000, accounting for 19.1 percent of Ghana's total population (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region>). The capital city is Kumasi, where Kumasi Academy, a high school and site of the meningitis outbreak, is located (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region>).The northern region of Ghana lies within the African meningitis belt where outbreaks of meningitis, usually due to _Neisseria meningitidis_, occur during the dry season, between December and May. The African meningitis belt is sub-Saharan and extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. A map can be seen at <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/pdf/yellowbook-2012-map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis.pdf>. However, several studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may also cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha> and <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>). In fact, ProMED-mail posted on an outbreak of pneumococcal meningitis in Ghana in 2016 (see also's below). Information from knowledgeable sources on this outbreak in Ghana would be welcomed. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2900>.]
