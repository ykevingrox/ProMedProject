Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy (CIDRAP) News [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/01/studies-show-spread-mcr-1-gene-china>Two studies [1,2] today [27 Jan 2017] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases indicate that a gene that can confer resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin has spread widely in clinical settings in China.The gene, known as _MCR-1_, was 1st identified in China in November 2015 in _Escherichia coli_ samples from pigs, pork products, and a handful of human cases. It has since been detected in more than 30 countries, including the United States. The emergence of the resistance gene was believed to be connected to widespread use of colistin in Chinese agriculture. China banned use of the drug in animal feed in 2016, based in part on the findings of that study.Though there have been few cases so far of human infections involving the gene -- which has mostly been found in animals -- _MCR-1_ has become a significant public health concern because colistin is one of the few antibiotics left that can be used to treat multidrug-resistant infections. And because the gene is carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids, it can be passed not only to different strains within a single family of bacteria -- such as _E coli_ -- but also to different types of bacteria.Among the most worrisome scenarios is the emergence of bacteria that harbor the _MCR-1_ gene along with other antibiotic-resistance genes. If the superbug carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were to acquire the gene, for example, it could present clinicians with infections that are nearly impossible to treat with current antibiotics.In the 1st study [1], led by members of the team that initially identified the _MCR-1_ gene, investigators from the United Kingdom and China tested more than 21 000 Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected at 2 hospitals in China's Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces from 2007 to 2015.Of the more than 17 000 isolates that were associated with infection, _MCR-1_ was detected in 76 of 5332 _E coli_ isolates (1.4%), 13 of 3480 _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolates (0.4%), 1 of 890 _Enterobacter cloacae_ isolates (0.1%), and 1 of 162 _Enterobacter aerogenes_ isolates (0.6%). The researchers noted an increase in the prevalence of _MCR-1_-positive _E coli_ in both hospitals over the sampling period.The team then did a retrospective case-control study to determine the risk factors for infection with _MCR-1_-positive _E coli_, comparing 76 _MCR-1_-positive _E coli_ isolates with 508 _MCR-1_-negative isolates. Their findings indicated that colistin-resistant infections tended to occur more among men who were immunosuppressed and had used antibiotics, particularly carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, in the previous 3 months.The researchers were also interested in risk factors for colonization with _MCR-1_-positive _E coli_. When they screened a mix of infected patients and healthy volunteers, they discovered that while antibiotic use was a major risk factor, living near a farm was not. This was something of a surprise, given that the initial _MCR-1_ study had linked the emergence of the gene to animal husbandry and use of colistin in livestock. This suggests, the authors note, that the gene could be spreading through environmental exposure.In the 2nd study [2], a team of Chinese scientists screened more than 2000 _E coli_ and _K pneumoniae_ isolates collected from patients with bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China from 2013 through 2014. They detected _MCR-1_ in 20 of the 1495 E coli isolates (1.3%), and only 1 of the 571 _K pneumoniae_ isolates (0.2%).The fact that both studies detected _MCR-1_ in several different pathogenic _E coli_ strains from hospitals in several provinces is a sign that the gene has spread widely in community and healthcare settings throughout the country. One of the strains, ST131, ""has long been recognized as the virulent global epidemic strain associated with human disease,"" the authors of the 1st study write. The strain, which has exhibited multidrug resistance, has become a major source of urinary tract infections throughout the world.The good news from both studies was that the overall prevalence of colistin-resistant isolates from infections was low, and neither team found many instances in which _MCR-1_-positive bacteria were also carbapenem resistant. In the 1st study, only 5 _MCR-1_ -positive _E coli_ isolates were resistant to carbapenems, although resistance to other antibiotics was common.The 2nd study [2] found only one isolate that was also carrying the NDM-5 enzyme, which enables bacteria to neutralize carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition, the _MCR-1_-positive isolates were found to be susceptible to several other antibiotics. None of the patients with colistin-resistant bloodstream infections died.""Therefore, at this stage, we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via MCR-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China,"" infectious disease experts David Paterson, MBBS, PhD, and David van Duin, MD, PhD, write in an accompanying commentary.But what's concerning is that colistin will soon be introduced into clinical settings in China. And if the _MCR-1_ gene has been spreading in China because of selection pressure caused by the use of colistin in agriculture, it could potentially take off when hospitals start using the drug, especially if use of other antibiotics is a risk factor.""The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily,"" Timothy Walsh, DSc, lead author of the 1st study and a professor at Cardiff University in Wales, said in a journal press release. ""The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans.""To date, _MCR-1_ has been detected in 5 human isolates in the United States. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it has increased surveillance for the gene in healthcare settings.[1. Wang, Yang et al.

Because the _mcr-1_ gene is located on a plasmid, it is capable of horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria of the same or even different species and is frequently linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other antibiotics. It has been identified worldwide and in current isolates, as well as in stored samples of _E. coli_ collected several years ago.The news report above mentions that both studies detected _MCR-1_ in several different pathogenic _E coli_ strains, one of which was sequence type ST131. This _E coli_ clone is increasingly reported worldwide as a significant pathogen causing community-associated infections such as urinary tract infection and bacteremia. It produces a CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), is resistant to fluoroquinolone and many other antimicrobial drugs, and has a large number of virulence-associated genes (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/51/3/286/307240/Escherichia-coli-Sequence-Type-ST131-as-the-Major>). The isolates remain susceptible to the carbapenem group of beta-lactams such as ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem. However, the concern is that the _mcr-1_ gene could readily transfer colistin resistance to bacteria that produce a carbapenemase, resulting in resistance to most, if not, all beta-lactams. The 1st study found carbapenem resistance in 5 of the 76 (6.6%) clinical _mcr-1_-positive _E coli_ isolates, and the 2nd study found carbapenem resistance in 1 of the 20 (5.0%) clinical _mcr-1_-positive _E coli_ isolates.See my moderator comments on the _mcr-1 gene_ in the prior ProMED-mail posts Antibiotic resistance - Denmark: colistin, MCR-1, salmonella, human, chicken, RFI 20151206.3844715 and Antibiotic resistance - China: colistin, plasmid-encoded, humans, animals 20151122.3810204. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
