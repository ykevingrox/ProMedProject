Journalist Osman Hashim told Radio Dabanga that 3 deaths have been reported in the city's districts on Monday and Tuesday, 18-19 Sep 2017, while 3 more people were in hospital on Wed 20 Sep 2017. He said that the residents throughout the city have launched clean-up and spraying campaigns to reduce the incidences of the disease. He attributed the emergence of cholera cases in Sinkat to water pollution.The Sudanese government continues to refer to ""acute watery diarrhea"" although multiple independent tests according to WHO standards confirm it is cholera. The National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not to make mention of cholera. The National Epidemiological Corporation, however, reported in July 2017 that nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera patients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in Blue Nile state in August 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Sudan can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Sudan> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] Cholera - Chad (Sila, Salamat regions)Date: Thu 21 Sep 2017Source: Medical Xpress [edited]<https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-people-died-chad-cholera-outbreak.html>The Chadian government said Thu 21 Sep 2017, that more than 50 people have died of cholera in Chad where authorities have since declared an outbreak. ""We count 312 cases, including 52 deaths,"" said health ministry secretary-general Hamid Djabar.Authorities declared a cholera outbreak on Mon 19 Sep 2017, which put in place a ""crisis committee"" to monitor the situation and to strengthen cooperation with partners such as medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the UN children's agency UNICEF.For the time being, the outbreak is confined to the region of Sila near the borders with Sudan and the Central African Republic, said Djabar. In the neighboring region of Salamat, 19 cases and 2 deaths were recorded, but the health ministry said the situation is ""under control"".Cholera regularly affects the east and the Lake Chad basin, the least developed areas of the country where half the population lives below the poverty threshold. ""In 2011, Chad, along with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, was affected by a large-scale cholera outbreak. More than 450 deaths and a total of 17 200 cases of the disease were reported,"" MSF said on its website.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case fatality rates in the 2 regions of Chad as reported here is substantially above the ""acceptable"" 1 percent level, with Sila having 52 deaths in 312 cases (16.6 percent) and Salamat 2 deaths in 19 cases (10.5 percent). - Mod.LLMaps of Chad can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/chad.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Borno state)Date: Tue 19 Sep 2017Source: Naija News, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report [edited]<https://www.naijanews.com/news/21846-cholera-outbreak-48-die-borno>48 persons have died of cholera since the outbreak of the deadly disease in August 2017, in Borno state, a humanitarian medical organization, MÌ©decins Sans FrontiÌ¬res (MSF) has said. The organization also known as Doctors without Borders, said that 2627 cases of the disease have been recorded by the state ministry of health. Anna Cilliers, MSF's Medical Coordinator said that the organization had scaled up its campaign to contain the cholera outbreak in Maiduguri, Monguno, and Dikwa local government areas of the state.""As new cases of cholera emerged from Monguno, Dikwa, and other parts of Maiduguri, MSF continues to scale up its response in the state. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 2627 cholera cases and 48 deaths were reported by the Borno State Ministry of Health. The state capital Maiduguri alone has witnessed 1425 cases, while 600 cases in Dikwa and 602 cases in Monguno have so far been reported.""Early diagnosis and treatment is vital to tackle cholera outbreak. As cases of the disease increased in Maiduguri, we rapidly set up a 100-bed capacity cholera Treatment Center (CTU) at Dala area of Maiduguri."" Cilliers disclosed in a statement that since 16 Aug 16, some 491 patients were admitted and 475 discharged at the center. She added that the organization had also set up another 50-bed capacity CTUcenter at the Muna Garage Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in the outskirts of Maiduguri, adding that the center would be upgraded to 100-bed capacity in the coming days, if the conditions warranted it.The medical coordinator lamented that the disease has begun to spread to other camps in the surrounding area and into the city. To contain the situation, Cilliers said, MSF operated an Oral Rehydration Point (ORT), where patients could access sugar and salt solution to help them to overcome severe dehydration. ""Patients arriving here in critical condition are taken directly in our ambulances to the cholera treatment centers.""The statement also quoted Dr Felix Kouassi, another MSF's Medical Coordinator, as saying that a 110-bed capacity treatment center was established at Monguno to combat the disease. Kouassi noted that patients with suspected cholera cases were isolated to curtail spread of the disease. ""We are worried that the number of beds currently planned may not be enough as cases continue to rise in the town.""The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the state government has commenced a 5-day cholera immunization campaign in the affected communities. About 900 000 persons were targeted for vaccination against the disease in the exercise while community sensitization on environment, sanitation and hygiene has also been conducted to control the disease.[Byline: Ibukun Josephine Bankole]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Nigeria can be seen at <http://www.ephotopix.com/image/africa/nigeria_political_map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[5] Cholera - South Sudan (Jonglei state)Date: Sun 24 Sep 2017Source: Radio Tamazuj [edited]<https://radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/suspected-cholera-cases-reported-in-duk-jonglei>At least 3 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in Duk county of Jonglei since 18 Sep 2017, a health official said.

In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
