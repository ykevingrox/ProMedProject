Cases have been observed at the Geosentinel site in Brescia and at 12 other infectious diseases and internal medicine centers located in several Italian cities (Negrar, Verona, Firenze, Mineo, Pavia, Reggio Emilia, Milan, Bologna).A total of 48 cases were observed, mainly young males (22.4 å± 5.8 years). All patients had fever and very intense muscle aches with inability to stand and walk. CPK, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values were always abnormal. Rhabdomyolysis was believed to be related to an infective agent in 16 (33.3percent) cases. In detail EBV-DNA was detected in 8 of 32 patients that were tested, IgM for Coxsackie virus in 5 of 27 and IgM for Cytomegalovirus in 3 of 29. In the remaining cases, the etiology was undefined. Four out of 7 patients tested for abnormal haemoglobins had sickle cell trait and one patient had hemophilia A. No seawater ingestion has been reported. In these cases the long incubation period does not support a mechanical cause of rhabdomyolysis. Otherwise, common viral infections like Epstein-Barr or Coxsackie virus are hardly associated with such severe clinical presentation. It is speculated that other predisposing conditions, in particular genetic factors considering the common area of origin, or unknown viral infections, may be involved. Targeted surveillance of rhabdomyolysis cases is warranted.If you have seen similar presentations at your site, please reply all and share your experience.--Patricia SchlagenhaufChair GeoSentinel Tracking and Communications<patricia.schlagenhauf@uzh.ch>David HamerPI GeoSentinel<dhamer@bu.edu>on behalf of GeoSentinel<http://www.istm.org/geosentinel>[Muscle damage causing elevated levels of CPK and myoglobin can be caused by a host of infectious and non-infectious etiologies.The following is a publication from Brescia that parallels these cases without a definitive etiology. All 4 cases presented with febrile rhabdomyolysis and subsequently recovered. No uniform diagnosis was made.Sabatini T, Begni A, Belli D, Fillipini A: Febrile rhabdomyolysis in African migrants coming to Italy through the Mediterranean Sea: A report of 4 cases. Case Rep Intern Med 2016;3: 36-37 URL: <http://dx.doi.org/10.5430/crim.v3n1p36>ABSTRACTIntroduction: In the last years many migrants, mostly from Africa and Middle East, are trying to reach Europe through the Mediterranean Sea. The crossing of the sea is usually associated to several problems, as overcrowding, promiscuous contacts with other people, physical and psychological distresses, malnutrition, dehydration and prolonged sunshine exposure.Case presentation: We report the cases of 4 young people (3 males and one female) African refugees presenting, after about 4 weeks from arrival in Europe, a febrile illness with high fever, severe prostration and very intense muscle aches with impossibility to stand and walk. Viral serology was not univocal. The patients recovered completely in almost a week.Conclusions: We think that migrants of Refugees Centers should undergo medical visits to check their clinical status and, in case of febrile illnesses, evaluated to understand the causes and the pathophysiology of these febrile diseases. It is also important to collect and register, from different European Refugee Centers through an International Organization, similar cases to prevent, in case of contagious diseases, the possible diffusion inside the Centers but also in the Community. - Mod.LLOther information about cases and potential etiologies would be welcome. - Mod.LMA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>.].................................................ep/ll/ec/lxl/lm"
