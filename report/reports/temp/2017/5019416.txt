The WHO team arrived in Karachi to provide assistance to the health authorities fighting the spread of chikungunya disease in the metropolis.The government of Sindh had sought WHO assistance to fight chikungunya disease in Karachi, where it is rapidly spreading, particularly in the city's areas of Orangi Town, Malir, Bin Qasim, Ibrahim Hyderi, Korangi, Lyari, Surjani Town, and Keamari. According to reports, medical tests have confirmed 39 new cases of chikungunya at Sindh Government Hospital Ibrahim Haidery and 18 positive cases at Saudabad Hospital.The blood samples of these patients were sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad to test for chikungunya infection, which were found positive, hospital officials said. Blood samples of more patients will be sent to NIH Islamabad to diagnose the disease, AMS Ibrahim Haidery hospital said.Previously, WHO -- in collaboration with the ministry of national health services, regulations and coordination of Pakistan -- had conducted an intensive house-to-house investigation over a few weeks to probe for the causes of the chikungunya fever outbreak in Balochistan. The investigation was carried out in Gwadar city in Balochistan. The number of suspected chikungunya cases reported in Balochistan as of 19 Apr 2017 stands at 1962. A total of 28 blood samples have tested positive for chikungunya.In Sindh, despite the precautionary steps taken to counter the viral infection from spreading, a rise has been noted, catching the provincial government's attention, which then sought the assistance of the international health organization.In light of samples collected from different hospitals and medical centres for testing, the doctors have concluded that the symptoms are of a mosquitoborne viral disease that causes fever and severe joint pain, which needs to be controlled.--communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[As Pakistan is already endemic for dengue, and since chikungunya was reported in December 2017, the number of cases is likely to increase, as the vector distribution and dynamics essentially remain unchanged. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.]
