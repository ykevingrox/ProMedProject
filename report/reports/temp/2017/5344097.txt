UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, MÌ©decins Sans FrontiÌ¬res report [edited]<http://tinyurl.com/y989nv2t>Since the cholera epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was declared on [9 Sep 2017], MÌ©decins Sans FrontiÌ¬res/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has treated 17 000 people after setting up around 30 units and treatment centers. The outbreak has already spread across 20 provinces, representing one of the largest cholera outbreaks seen in DRC, and has not yet been brought under control. MSF is urging for increased prevention and awareness-raising activities, and for more organizations to respond in tackling the epidemic.The outbreak erupted in June 2017 in North Kivu province and has so far spread to 20 of the country's 26 provinces, reaching epidemic proportions in 11. More than 24 000 people have been affected and 500 deaths have been reported. Cholera is endemic in 6 provinces of the country, but the drought of recent months and the high mobility of the population in certain areas have resulted in a faster spread and a greater impact, with 28 per cent more cases than in 2016.""We are carrying out a wide response to cover the most affected areas of the country, and the number of patients in our centers has declined in recent weeks"", says Cisco Otero, MSF head of mission in DRC. ""However, what has become evident is the urgent need to develop prevention measures, like vaccination and water sanitation in the areas where cholera is endemic, to avoid outbreaks of this magnitude and prevent their spread.""Since the beginning of the year [2017], MSF's response has been focused in establishing cholera treatment units and centers [CTC], and making donations of material in the provinces where cholera is endemic as well as those where the disease has spread. MSF is present in the provinces of Kwilu, Haut-Lomami, Central Kongo, Tanganyika, North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Bas UÌ©lÌ©, and Maniema. In recent days, new activities have also started in Haut-Lomami and extended in South Kivu.""Containing the epidemic is the main priority"", said Otero. ""The rainy season is coming and that can spread the virus even faster and lead to a critical situation.""South Kivu province-------------------South Kivu province has been the most affected in the last week. There, MSF has received an unusually high number of patients in endemic areas and in its permanent structures in the capital, Bukavu, in Baraka and Sebele, as well as in smaller places like Minova, Kabare, Katana, Idjwi-Kihumba, Lulimba, Missi, and Nyange. In all of these locations, the risk of disease spread is enormous, due to the large concentration of people and its geography, which almost forces people to obtain non-potable water from the lake. Minova is the town most affected, with more than 1400 people treated.North Kivu province-------------------In Goma, North Kivu, where cholera is endemic, MSF has a permanent project running 2 cholera treatment centers. Since the beginning of the outbreak, MSF has opened another 6 CTCs in the city, accompanied by community health promotion, multiple rehydration points and assuring water treatment. The size of the current outbreak in this location is partly due to a long dry season and technical problems with water supply, on top of pre-existing poor sewage facilities and a deficient water supply system. These elements combine with poverty and lack of community information make an epidemic more likely. The city is also on the shores of Lake Kivu, and a majority of the population is obliged to take water directly from the lake, despite the pollution by human waste. Between 26 Jun 2017 and 21 Sep 2017, 6287 patients have been treated and 18 people have died in the worst epidemic that the region has seen since 2012.Haut-Lomami province--------------------Since early September 2017, MSF has also intervened in the health area of Mulongo, after the epidemic arrived in August 2017. Mulongo is located in the province of Haut-Lomami, where the epidemic began in May 2017 in the lake areas, and then spread along the Lulaba River until reaching the city. On 15 Aug 2017, the Mulongo cholera treatment centre opened. MSF teams support the treatment center and have also provided five additional oral rehydration points, in addition to the provision of safe drinkable water. In Mulongo, 844 patients have been treated, and 15 fatalities reported. MSF has also built chlorination points along the lake and conducts surveillance and awareness activities.Tanganyika province-------------------In Tanganyika, cholera is endemic and the current number of cases corresponds to levels seen in past years. However, the rainy season has not yet begun and with around 100 000 displaced people living in makeshift camps and schoolyards in and around Kalemie, there is a very high risk that the disease will spread rapidly if conditions deteriorate. In the last week, 84 cases of cholera were reported and are being treated by the Ministry of Health in Kalemie general hospital, which MSF supports with rehabilitation, training and donations. MSF teams in the Kalemie area are preparing a vaccination campaign with local authorities and they will increase their sanitation activities. Other teams are evaluating the situation at Manono, Ankoro and Kongolo, along the Lualaba River.Kongo Central province----------------------In February and March 2017, MSF treated 332 cholera patients in Matadi and Kimpese (Kongo Central) before transferring their activities. Unfortunately, some actors didn't respect their commitments and the outbreak returned again a few weeks later, spreading on a regional level and MSF teams had to return to Kimpese. Nearly 1700 people were hospitalized in the treatment center and 897 consultations were carried out.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the provinces of Congo DR can be found at <http://goo.gl/DM2AT8> and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the country at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>. - Mod.

Amhara regional state had the highest number of infected people with 3000, followed by Tigray regional state at 1200, and Afar regional state at 300.Speaking to reporters on [Fri 15 Sep 2017], health minister Yifru Berhan said the diarrhea outbreaks are being controlled through collaboration of his ministry and regional health bureaus. The ministry in particular is working on eradicating possible acute watery diarrhea breeding grounds by treating unhygienic conditions in mining areas, agricultural areas and factories. Berhan also said educational programs on the cause of AWD are being taught in addition to monetary assistance being given to regional health bureaus to deal with diarrhea outbreaks.With Ethiopia's rainy season stretching from late June to September already underway, the ministry has urged community members to stay vigilant to avoid the spread of infectious diarrhea.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In some countries, acute watery diarrhea is used as a euphemism for cholera.The location of the states noted can be found on a map of Ethiopia at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Ethiopia> and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the country at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/95>. - Mod.LL]******[5] Diarrhea - Philippines (Palawan province)Date: Sat 23 Sep 2017 12:35 PM PHTSource: Philippine News Agency [edited]<http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1010395>The municipality of Quezon in southern Palawan is now under a ""state of emergency"" due to the diarrhea outbreak brought about by contaminated drinking water sources. Dr Allan Paciones, of the Quezon Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMO), confirmed to the Philippine News Agency on [Fri 22 Sep 2017], the death of 4 people due to the outbreak. He said 2 of the fatalities are from Barangay Malatgao, and 1 each from Barangays Alfonso XIII and Pinaglabanan.Paciones cited that per water sampling tests conducted by the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU) of the Department of Health (DOH), the 4 Quezon residents succumbed to severe gastroenteritis. In Barangay Pinaglabanan, where the outbreak supposedly started, the cases recorded were minor compared to Alfonso XIII and Malatgao, where 2 had died, Paciones said. He said this is due to person-to-person transfer of bacteria in Pinaglabanan unlike in the other 2 barangays, where residents may have defecated near the water sources.""Residents may have discharged waste matter near the water sources, and because it is raining, the bacteria flowed to our water system,"" he said.""Although we now have less recorded cases compared in July and August 2017 due to the conduct of mass treatment, we continue to warn residents of Quezon against drinking water without boiling it first or treating with Aquatabs,"" he said. Paciones added even their purified water refilling stations have been found to be contaminated by a bacteria whose kind will still be identified by the RESU with the help of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). ""The RESU will send samples to the RITM to determine what type of bacteria it is, and after a week we will know,"" Paciones said.Aside from the mass treatment, which involves the decontamination of water sources and distribution of purification tablets like Aquatabs, the municipal government is now conducting information awareness and daily monitoring of cases. As of 8 Sep 2017, cases have gone down from 727 to 199, and if the downtrend does not continue, Quezon town will have to elevate the declaration from state of emergency to calamity, he said. ""Since the declaration of state of emergency last week, a fund of PHP 250 000 [about US 4900] had been released for our use to solve the health issue. If the downtrend doesn't remain that way, we will declare a state of calamity as we were told the only solution for now is to have residents drink bottled water,"" the MDRRMO chief said.[Byline: Celeste Anna Formoso]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the Philippines can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63167>.

Health officials found that another member of the group, a woman in her 20s, also had nausea and diarrhea and was later diagnosed with the disease. The 2 were quoted by the agency as saying that they ate mostly well-cooked food during the trip, but ate seafood at a restaurant that appeared to have poor sanitary conditions. The centers determined the case to be a clustered outbreak and collected samples from 13 other members of the group.As of [Sun 24 Sep 2017], a total of 120 bacillary dysentery cases have been reported in 2017, including 44 travelers, with Indonesia being the largest source of infections at 39, CDC statistics showed. The disease has an incubation period of 12 to 96 hours, but it can take as much as a week for symptoms to develop, Huang said, adding that the bacteria often spreads through food or water contaminated by infected human feces, flying insects, or cutting board cross contamination.The agency urged people to be especially cautious about food hygiene when traveling abroad, try to eat only well-cooked food, avoid beverages or iced desserts that are not properly packaged, frequently wash their hands and maintain good personal hygiene at all times.[Byline: Lee I-chia]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Taiwan can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193> and of Indonesia at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/556>.Bacterial dysentery is caused by _Shigella_, which was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL]
