Express Newsline [edited]<http://expressnewsline.com/2017/08/26/mosquito-capable-of-spreading-zika-virus-found-in-livonia.html>A type of mosquito that can spread the Zika virus has been found in the Metro Detroit area.""Finding Asian tiger mosquitoes in Michigan is no reason for great concern."" However, it is always a good idea to take precautions against all mosquito bites since they can carry a number of diseases, such as the Zika and West Nile viruses.Efforts to investigate the spread of Asian tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_] in Wayne County are ongoing. Preventative measures include eliminating sources of standing water such as wading pools, old tires, buckets, and containers; wearing long-sleeved shirts, trousers, and socks when outside; applying insect repellent; and making sure doors and windows have tight-fitting screens.They say the species has been extending its known range and recently was found in Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Connecticut.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The appearance of _Aedes albopictus_ in southeastern Michigan is not surprising. This mosquito has been found recently in areas near to Michigan, in the Upper Midwest USA and in southern Ontario province, Canada. The local health authorities are correct in that there are not sufficiently abundant populations of _Ae. aegypti_ in Michigan to permit ongoing transmission of Zika, dengue, or chikungunya viruses. Although this species can go into diapause to survive the winter, it seems unlikely that significant populations of the mosquito will develop in Michigan. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2281>.]
