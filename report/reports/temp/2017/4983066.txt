AllAfrica, The Herald report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201704200175.html>A total of 9 people from Binga District, Matabeleland North, are being treated for anthrax after consuming meat from infected hippos that died a fortnight ago. Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals, especially ruminants. Speaking to The Herald yesterday [19 Apr 2017], Matabeleland North provincial medical director Dr Nyasha Masuka said the 9, who included 3 children, were among 58 others whom health workers were following up for possible infection.""We have so far treated 9 people, 5 males and 3 females, from Siansundu village for anthrax and our teams are closely monitoring 58 others who also ate the dead hippos for any signs or symptoms of the disease,"" said Dr Masuka. He said of the 9 infected, 8 had [subcutaneous] anthrax which affects the skin and manifests in the form of ulcers, while one was complaining of headache, which is synonymous with meningeal anthrax.Dr Masuka said meningeal anthrax affected mainly the brain and its symptoms included headaches. Other forms of anthrax include intestinal, whose symptoms are normally vomiting, and pulmonary anthrax, which affects the lungs.2 weeks ago, 16 hippos were found dead along the Zambezi river in Binga. Although initial suspicion of the cause of the animal's death was poisoning, the Department of Veterinary Services under the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development confirmed that anthrax had caused the death.According to the department, Binga was an anthrax hot spot and this was not the 1st time that hippos had died from the disease in the area.[Byline: Paidamoyo Chipunza, Elita Chikwati]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 19 Apr 2017 15:28 CATSource: Bulawayo 24 News, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) News report [edited] <http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-108652.html>The Ministry of Health and Child Care has recorded 9 cases of suspected human anthrax from the individuals who ate meat from dead hippos at Mlibizi in Binga [Matabeleland North]. The ministry has been carrying out investigations in Mlibizi from [15 Apr 2017] and found that there are 58 villagers from Saba Village who ate meat from the dead hippos.The samples have been sent to the National Reference Laboratory in Harare for confirmation.An awareness programme has been held at Chief Saba Village with more than 400 villagers to sensitise them on the dangers of eating meat from animal carcases whose cause of death is unknown. Matabeleland North provincial medical director Dr Nyasha Masuka says 1.5 kilogrammes [3.3 lb] of hippo meat was found mixed with 45 kilogrammes [99 lb] of goat meat on sale in a butchery at Binga Centre and has been destroyed to eliminate human contact with the infected meat.""The suspected cases were showing symptoms of what is called a cutaneous form of anthrax, which affects the skin and that one is not fatal but people can also get the gastro-intestinal one that affects the gastrointestinal system which is your stomach and the intestines. They can also get the pulmonary one which affects the lungs and they can also get what is called the meningeal form, which affects the brain and those 3 forms can be fatal,"" said Dr Masuka. [Pneumonic anthrax should not be expected in these circumstances. - Mod.MHJ]The ministry is now ensuring that there is the destruction of any carcasses and biltong [aka jerky] because the bacteria from anthrax can survive in the same environment for 30 to 90 years. ""It means that even when we think the outbreak is over if people happen to go around where it was buried or was not disinfected properly, it survives for a long time, this is what people when they do bio-terrorism, it's very resistant,"" added Dr Masuka.The 9 suspected cases and the rest of the villagers who ate the meat are now undergoing treatment which will take 14 days.The hippos carcases were first discovered on [27 Mar 2017] and villagers were eating the meat despite the fact the cause of death was unknown to them.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Zimbabwe can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/zimbabwe.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2956>.For a description of Matabeleland North on the western border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matabeleland_North_Province>.

Cutaneous anthrax responds well to antibiotic treatment. Anthrax meningitis is frequently under-reported but if the medics have caught it early, it should work out fine. So far, so good. The hippos loses have been modest and there were few human cases probably just from handling the contaminated hippo meat. - Mod.MHJ]
