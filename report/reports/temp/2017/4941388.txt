Fox47 News [edited]<http://www.fox47news.com/yes/yestohealth/officials-confirm-1st-measles-case-in-michigan-this-year>The Michigan Department of Health and Human services is confirming the 1st case of measles in the state this year [2017].The state announced [Wed 29 Mar 2017] that a person in southeastern Michigan is being hospitalized after recently traveling internationally and getting sick.There was one confirmed case last year [2016] of measles in Michigan. Nationally in 2014 there were 667 cases, including 5 in Michigan. A majority of those cases involved people who were not vaccinated.The state notes that measles is a highly contagious illness and vaccinations are an effective way to prevent it. Measles typically will start with a high fever, red eyes, runny nose, sensitivity to light, and eventually rashes on the face and head that progress to other parts of the body.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[While the country where this individual traveled and was assumed to have been exposed to measles virus is not identified, this report once again points to the problem of exposure during travel to regions where measles has not been controlled even though measles in one's country of origin may be essentially eliminated. Thus, it remains important to maintain a high level of vaccine immunity in the population.A healthmap showing the location of Michigan in the United States can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>. - Mod.LK]******[2] TaiwanDate: Thu 30 Mar 2017Source: Taipei Times [edited]<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/03/30/2003667753>A 27-year-old Taiwanese man has been confirmed to have the nation's 3rd case of imported measles this year [2017], the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on [Tue 28 Mar 2017], adding that the man became infected while on vacation in Europe.The man, who lives in northern Taiwan, visited France, Belgium and the Netherlands as a member of a tour group from [7 Mar--15 Mar 2017]. He transferred flights in Bangkok before returning to Taiwan, CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said.The man 1st went to a clinic complaining of a fever on [Sun 19 Mar 2017], then returned on [Thu 23 Mar 2017] last week when his symptoms persisted, Lo said, adding that the next day [Fri 24 Mar 2017], after developing a rash, he sought treatment at a hospital.The hospital reported the case and asked the man to quarantine himself at home, Lo said, adding that test results on [Tue 28 Mar 2017] confirmed that he has measles.""Measles can easily be misdiagnosed as hives, which is caused by an allergic reaction,"" Lo said. ""Measles has an incubation period of about 7 days and the man was likely infected during his vacation in Europe.""Outbreaks of measles have been reported in European countries and in Thailand, so the centers are unable to specify the exact location where he became infected, but it is monitoring the condition of 166 people who came into direct contact with the man after his return to Taiwan, he said.A unique feature of measles is that a rash usually appears on the head and neck that then spreads to the rest of the body, Lo said. ""All 3 cases of measles reported this year [2017] were imported from abroad,"" he said, adding that of other nations in the region, China has reported the most measles cases -- about 1200 -- this year [2017].The prevalence of the disease in Europe seems to be increasing, with Romania bearing the brunt of infections, reporting about 3800 cases this year [2017], he said.
