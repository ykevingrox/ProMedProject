According to the information provided by the department store concerned, the sale of the product has ceased since the end of June this year [2017].""The spokesman further said, ""The CFS has also followed up with Addison Industrial (Group) Limited, the importer and packer of the product concerned. The investigation showed that the affected batch of product was only for sale at the above-mentioned department store. The Centre has requested the importer concerned to stop sales and initiate a recall of the affected batch of the product. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2418 2016 during office hours for inquiries about the recall."" The CFS appealed to members of the public who have purchased and still possess the affected batch of the product to stop consuming it, and to seek medical advice immediately if symptoms develop after consuming the food. The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing.Mushroom poisoning is generally acute and manifested by a variety of symptoms, depending on the species and amount consumed. The incubation period is usually short. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are the commonest symptoms. Sometimes distinguishing features such as extreme thirst, profuse sweating, hallucination, coma and other neurological symptoms may occur. Furthermore, consumers are advised to heed the following points when buying and eating fresh mushrooms:- Do not buy mushroom products which are suspected to include a mix of unknown species;- Do not buy mushrooms which look unhygienic (with growing substrates left with the product) or show signs of spoilage (with coloured spots/abnormal smell/slime, etc);- Wash and cook mushrooms thoroughly before consumption; and- Seek medical treatment immediately if mushroom poisoning is suspected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Porcini mushrooms are a much flavored mushroom with a big global market; see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus_edulis> and <http://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/porcini-mushrooms.html#sthash.muejVDqk.dpbs>. So the attraction is obvious. But it sometimes happens with recalls that fearing financial loss ""recalled"" products are redirected outwards. So if you see Chinese mushrooms in your local supermarket, it might be wise to forego their purchase and consumption for the while. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.]
