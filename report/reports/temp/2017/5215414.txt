UNICEF [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/cholera-outbreaks-central-and-west-africa-2017-regional-update-10>With 15 456 suspected cases including 441 deaths (CFR of 2.85%) reported as per W27, the cholera epidemiological situation in DR Congo is greatly serious and worrisome. An impressive outbreak has started in North Kivu province, affecting mainly Goma, Karisimbi, Nyirango and Binza. Based on this specific situation, the regional cholera platform has looked for additional information and found out that 1464 cumulated cases including 12 deaths were reported in a 4-week time (between W24 and W28) in the sole North Kivu province. Data show that a high proportion of deaths are children (3 out of 5, and 1 pregnant woman). The overall cost for the response plan from the provincial government is estimated at USD 532 345, with a funding gap of USD 490 623 (92%).Nigeria------In the reporting week ending on 2 Jul 2017, 186 suspected cholera cases including 10 deaths were reported over all of Nigeria: 110 including 10 deaths (CFR=9.1%) from Zamfara state (neighboring the country of Niger), 61 from Kwara state, 10 from Jigawa state and 5 from Kaduna state. The regional cholera platform joins the Nigeria Center for Disease Control's call for multi-sectoral collaboration between states and relevant ministries, agencies, and departments (MDAs) and partner agencies in ensuring that a holistic approach is taken during preparation and response to outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases and public health events of concern. Out of the 28 LGA affected so far, 19 had been identified and recognized from the previous epidemiological studies as cholera hotspots. We thus insist on calling partners to support local, state and federal authorities in implementing effective and efficient controlling measures to prevent any further expansion. We also call on those sharing the same epidemiological basins, i.e. neighboring states (northeast states such as Borno and Yobe) and countries (Benin, Niger, Cameroon) to increase their vigilance and, should any suspected cases be reported, initiate immediate action to prevent any additional outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - SomaliaDate: Sat 29 Jul 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/somalia-cholera-cases-rise-1000/>The Ministry of Health of Somalia has reported 1068 acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/cholera cases and 3 deaths for week 28 (10-16 Jul 2017) with a case-fatality rate of 0.3%. Of these, the highest number of cases (286/27%) was reported in Middle Shebelle region, followed by Mudug, Sool and Banadir. The cumulative number of cases stands at 58 524, including 812 deaths, in 15 regions across the country. The overall case-fatality rate of 1.4% remains above the emergency threshold of 1%.The cholera outbreak which started in January 2017 is slowing down, thanks to timely interventions by WHO, national health authorities and health partners. WHO and health partners have been working in partnership with the Ministry of Health and local authorities to bring much needed relief to the population.Cholera response and prevention efforts are being continued throughout the country. With improvements to the surveillance systems in the country, a total of 265 sentinel health facilities are now able to report on health alerts, in addition to existing reporting mechanisms. Chlorination of water sources was conducted in selected villages and IDP camps in Lower Jubba among returnees.Community sensitization was conducted in IDP camps in Kismayo. Nearly 60 tons of essential medical supplies have been distributed to all regions since the start of the outbreak. Somalia has been experiencing a severe drought due to lack of rains for consecutive seasons and poor rainfall. With livestock and crops destroyed and hundreds of thousands of Somalis displaced, around 6.7 out of 12.3 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Nearly 5.5 million people are at risk of contracting water-borne diseases like cholera.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
