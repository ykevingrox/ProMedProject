WTOL-11 [edited]<http://www.wtol.com/story/36180908/invasive-mosquito-found-in-toledo-could-be-potential-carrier-of-zika-virus>The Toledo Area Sanitary District has discovered a breeding population of Asian tiger mosquitoes, or _Aedes albopictus_. The mosquitoes were found in the area of Dorr Street and Westwood on [Fri 18 Aug 2017]. Asian Tiger mosquitoes are typically daytime biting mosquitoes that are associated with being potential carriers for several mosquitoborne diseases of concern, such as the Zika virus.The mosquitoes are the 1st documented population of the invasive species within Lucas County. They breed in cryptic water-holding containers commonly found around homes. Officials say that it's very important that homeowners look for potential mosquito breeding locations around their homes to help contain and prevent the spread of this mosquito. To reduce mosquito breeding, empty standing water from flowerpots, gutters, buckets, pool covers, birdbaths and other containers that hold water.If homeowners have containers that are too big to empty, officials say products that contain BTI, or _Bacillus thuringiensis_ serotype israelensis, work to control mosquito larvae and can be purchased from home improvement stores. Officials say these products can be very effective is used according to the manufacturer's instructions and individual product label.Residents at Ottawa Park say they wonder how the first documented Asian tiger mosquitos made its way to the area, but they are not intimidated by these day biting invasive mosquitoes.Toledo Area Sanitary District employees will canvass area neighborhoods looking for mosquito breeding locations over the next few days. Control efforts have been increased in the area and surveillance will be ongoing to determine the extent of the mosquitoes' establishment. ""We have the mosquito here we don't know if we have the disease here, it doesn't appear we do,"" said Eric Zgodzinski, health commissioner. ""So the concept is that we can now focus in on that we have the mosquito so we know it's here now we need to treat it like any other mosquito and not get bitten."" If you notice anything out of the ordinary after a bite, the health department encourages you to contact your doctor.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Finding _Aedes albopictus_ in Ohio this year (2017) is not surprising. This mosquito was found in Clark county last year (2016) as well. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's map of geographic areas suitable for this mosquito includes all of Ohio <http://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/range.html>. As noted in earlier comments, although most of the new localities in which _Aedes albopictus_ has been detected have been in California, the species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. However, as University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out, viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states.While most reports identify _A. albopictus_ as vectors of dangerous tropical and subtropical viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, no mention is made about their potential role as vectors of viruses that are of public health concern in temperate zones in the eastern USA -- La Crosse and Jamestown Canyon. It has been shown in the laboratory that this mosquito species is susceptible to infection by both of these orthobunyaviruses. Dual infections by both of these viruses can result in reassortment of the 3 RNA strands, with all 6 reassortants produced. These 2 viruses can co-circulate in the same woodlands in places like the Upper Midwest of the USA. Should _A. albopictus_ become established in ecosystems where these 2 viruses are endemic, the emergence of new, reassorted viruses is possible. - Mod.TYA map showing the location of Lucas and Clark counties can be accessed at: <http://geology.com/county-map/ohio.shtml> and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail of the USA showing the location of Ohio at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237>.]
