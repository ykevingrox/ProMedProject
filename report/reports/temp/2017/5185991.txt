The Daily Star [edited]<http://www.thedailystar.net/country/bangladesh-dead-sitakunda-kids-were-suffering-from-measles-say-health-experts-after-laboratory-tests-1434499>The total of 9 children, who died showing similar symptoms in Sitakunda of Chittagong recently, were suffering from measles, according to Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).The assertion came today [Mon 17 Jul 2017] after a medical team from Dhaka collected blood and serum samples from the affected children, and conducted laboratory tests.""The disease spread out through measles virus. But it won't further spread,"" Prof Dr Abul Kalam Azad, director general of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), told The Daily Star following the tests.Last reported, at least 87 children were also suffering from the same disease in a remote hilly village of Tripura Para area. Many of them were being treated at Chittagong Medical College Hospital while the rest at Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease in Fouzderhat.Children aged between 1 and 12 started having fever a week ago. The other symptoms include body rash, breathing problems, vomiting and blood in stool, say locals and doctors.Citing malnutrition of the children as one of the reasons for the disease, Prof Dr Abul Kalam Azad also said that no one will likely to be infected with the virus. ""Treatment of the victims is underway,"" he said asking the guardians not to panic over it.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Severe measles: causes and responseDate: Tue 18 Jul 2017, 12:00 AMSource: The Daily Star [edited]<http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/measles-neglect-killed-the-9-sitakunda-kids-1434724>Medical examinations have confirmed measles as the cause of death of 9 children at Tripura Para in Sitakunda upazila of Chittagong. The children were never vaccinated, and people of the area have not received any health service whatsoever from the government, said officials of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at a press conference yesterday [Mon 17 Jul 2017].Prof Abul Kalam Azad, director general of the DGHS, said the authorities became certain by the test results of blood and serum samples from the affected children that they had been infected by measles. ""They [the deceased children] were suffering from malnutrition too, which caused the disease to take a serious turn,"" he said at the conference held at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). The deaths could have been prevented if the children were given proper treatment, he said, apologising for the sad and irreversible event. Meanwhile, one more child, from Sonachori union, was hospitalised yesterday [Mon 17 Jul 2017], reports our correspondent from Chittagong. With the latest one, the number of hospitalised children having similar symptoms rose to 88. Of them, 53 have been receiving treatment at Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH) while the rest at Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease (BITID) in Fouzderhat. A medical team from Dhaka went there and collected blood and serum samples from the affected children.At the press conference, the director general, accompanied by a WHO medical officer, assured that no one else would be infected with the virus since a temporary centre had been set up in the affected area to conduct an immunisation programme.About Tripura Para having been left out of the government's vaccination campaign, Prof Azad said the vaccination programme was on as per a ""micro plan"" at the ward level, but somehow Tripura Para, a small area resided by 85 families, remained out of the coverage. ""Now we have decided to overhaul the whole micro-plan system at the village level,"" to check if any small area is out of the immunisation programme, he said, adding that a committee would be formed to find out the people responsible for the exclusion of the area.All the children receiving treatment now are between 1 and 12 years. The symptoms include fever, rash, breathing problems, vomiting, and blood in stool, said Azizur Rahman Siddique, civil surgeon of Chittagong.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED is grateful to the Epicore member who submitted report [2] as a response to ""Undiagnosed illness - Bangladesh: (CG) fatal, children, RFI 20170713.5172943"", in such a timely manner.It is sad to learn the children still die from a vaccine-preventable disease. Certainly, malnutrition and reduced access to health care services contributed to the severity of the disease presentation. Case fatality rates of 5 to 25 percent are common in developing countries in contrast to the less than 1 percent case fatality rate in the United States during the epidemic of 1989 -- 1990. In the developing world, epidemiologic factors associated with severe measles include younger age, overcrowding, poor access to care, pre-existing medical conditions, and malnutrition. Because these factors frequently coexist in the developing world, the relative contribution of each to measles morbidity is unclear. However, malnutrition has been implicated in increased morbidity and mortality of childhood measles most markedly and repeatedly.Responding to malnutrition is imperative. The ability to treat and prevent malnutrition has been transformed in recent years by strategies relying on ready-to-use therapeutic and supplementary foods. Most children with severe malnutrition can now be treated by caregivers at home.Furthermore, lack of access to health care and limited medical capacity dramatically reduces the chances for treatment once the disease is apparent. It appears from the report that vaccination and access to medical care are being addressed by the government in this remote area now.References----------1. Cabrol JC.
