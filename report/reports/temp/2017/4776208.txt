According to the details from the Biobio Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; local ministerial administrative unit], the fatal case was infected 20 days ago while collecting colihue [a bamboo native to the Valdivian rainforests, humid temperate forests of Chile. - Mod.TY] when he went into thick vegetation.Another case in this region is a 41 year old man from the TomÌ© community, who is currently hospitalized in a stable condition, without the need of respiratory assistance. His infection occurred about the time of the Christmas celebrations, while the individual carried out activity in the forest.In the Biobio region alone, during 2016, there were 10 cases of hantavirus infections, 1 of which was fatal. In 2017 there have been 5 cases related to the virus that is transmitted by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and this only occurs with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57414>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54750>.]
