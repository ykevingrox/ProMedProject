Associated Press [edited]<http://wtop.com/virginia/2017/07/rise-in-hepatitis-c-cases-leads-to-arrests-of-tattooists/>A rise in hepatitis C cases has led to the arrests of tattoo artists in southwest Virginia. The Roanoke Times reported [Sun 2 Jul 2017] that more people could be charged as the investigation continues. Police in Pulaski, Virginia, arrested 4 men in June 2017 for unlicensed tattooing, a misdemeanor offense. Hepatitis is a viral infection that can damage people's livers, sometimes fatally.Police Chief Gary Roche and attorneys working on the cases said they could not recall similar charges in the region's courts.Pulaski police issued a warning in May 2017 that hepatitis C had been spread by unclean and unlicensed tattooing. It is illegal in Virginia to charge money for tattoos without a license and health departments are required to inspect tattoo parlors.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It would be interesting to know if data was available in these Virginia cases or elsewhere to demonstrate genetic identity of HCV between recipients of tattoo recipients in a look back program or with a tattooist who is infected.Certainly tattooing is a risk factor for the acquisition of hepatitis C, even in persons with a history of injection drug use, as demonstrated in the publication below. Most studies do not have data on the licensure status of the tattooist.Carney K, Dhalla S, Aytaman A, Tenner CT, Francois F: Association of tattooing and hepatitis C virus infection: a multicenter case-control study. Hepatology. 2013;57: 2117-2123.Abstract--------""Although injection drug use (IDU) and blood transfusions prior to 1992 are well-accepted risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, many studies that evaluated tattooing as a risk factor for HCV infection did not control for a history of IDU or transfusion prior to 1992. In this large, multicenter, case-control study, we analyzed demographic and HCV risk factor exposure history data from 3871 patients, including 1930 with chronic HCV infection (HCV RNA-positive) and 1941 HCV-negative (HCV antibody-negative) controls. Crude and fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of tattoo exposure by multivariate logistic regression in HCV-infected versus controls were determined. As expected, IDU (65.9 percent versus 17.8 percent; P < 0.001), blood transfusion prior to 1992 (22.3 percent versus 11.1 percent; P < 0.001), and history of having one or more tattoos (OR, 3.81; 95 percent CI, 3.23-4.49; P < 0.001) were more common in HCV-infected patients than in control subjects. After excluding all patients with a history of ever injecting drugs and those who had a blood transfusion prior to 1992, a total of 1886 subjects remained for analysis (465 HCV-positive patients and 1421 controls). Among these individuals without traditional risk factors, HCV-positive patients remained significantly more likely to have a history of one or more tattoos after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (OR, 5.17; 95 percent CI, 3.75-7.11; P < 0.001). Tattooing is associated with HCV infection, even among those without traditional HCV risk factors such as IDU and blood transfusion prior to 1992"" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/247>.]
