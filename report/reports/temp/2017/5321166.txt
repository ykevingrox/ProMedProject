In contrast with Japan, The Republic of Korea has experienced a dramatic increase in rates since the disease was 1st reported.Reference:1. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1vlA_wi2xo>--Prof. Steve BergerGeographic MedicineTel Aviv Medical CenterIsrael<mberger@post.tau.ac.il>[Unfortunately, ProMED-mail is unable to post the graph, but the link in the text will bring it up. The graph clearly shows the difference in incidences of SFTS per 100 000 for Japan and the higher and increasing rate for South Korea. The reference given demonstrates how Gideon can produce comparative graphs. ProMED thanks Dr. Steve Berger for this comment and links with demonstrations.A note in the comment on the previous post, SFTS virus is endemic in East Asia, including Korea. The virus is transmitted by the scrub or bush tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, which was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago. With no vaccine available, avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure available.Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick can be seen at <http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm>.Maps of South Korea can be accessed at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/korea-south-admin-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195> and Japan at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12782>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Severe fever with thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (03) 20170914.5317501Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (02): (HN) 20170803.5223983Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (KW) 20170618.51137862014----Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia syndrome - China, South Korea 20140705.2589725Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (02): (HN) clarification 20140622.2558325Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea: (HN) 20140525.24969062013----Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (05): additional fatalities 20130706.1810682Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (04): update 20130531.1748057Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (03): conf 20130529.1744411Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (02): (HB) susp 20130528.1739822Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - Japan, South Korea: update 20130526.1738022Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea: suspected 20130521.1729124].................................................jh/ty/ec/jh"
