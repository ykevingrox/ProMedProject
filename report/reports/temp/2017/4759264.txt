He was diagnosed and treated for a hantavirus [infection] in SK. Routine laboratory investigations were found within normal reference range.So far, a definitive diagnosis (lab confirmation) of Hantavirus has not been established in Nepal, though patients having clinical symptoms similar to a hantavirus [infections] are frequently encountered in clinical practice. More than 5000 Nepali migrant workers are employed in Korea annually, and the absence of hantavirus in Nepal, therefore, cannot be ruled out until they get tested for the virus.--Dr.Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research Unit, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease HospitalKathmanduNepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[It is not clear if the patient's diagnosis in South Korea was laboratory confirmed. It has not been confirmed in Nepal. Clinically, it is not stated if the patient suffered from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or had a different set of symptoms, nor if he was hospitalized in South Korea. One wonders if severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome was ruled out in South Korea. The results of the laboratory investigations are indicated as within normal range, but the parameters measured are not given. Obviously, the patient was well enough to have traveled from South Korea to Nepal. If it was HFRS, the viruses possibly involved could be Seoul, Hantaan or Puumala viruses.Dr Sher Bahadur Pun is thanked for sending in this report.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Nepal can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/139> and of South Korea at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195>.- Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/139>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195>.][See Also:2013----Seoul virus - Sweden: pet rat, 1st detection 20130705.1809509Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - Japan, South Korea: update 20130526.17380222008----Undiagnosed hemorrhagic disease - China: (Shandong), RFI 20080727.2300].................................................dk/ty/mj/ao/dk"
