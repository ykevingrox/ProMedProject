DÌ a a DÌ a [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.diaadia.com.pa/el-pais/detectan-nuevo-caso-de-fiebre-de-hantavirus-en-tonosi-322871>The Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud; MINSA) in Los Santos province confirmed a new case of hantavirus fever from TonosÌ . The epidemiologist Carlos MuÌ±oz stated that the case is a 7 year old child, who was hospitalized in the TonosÌ  Rural Hospital and today [21 Aug 2017] was moved to the JoaquÌ n Pablo Franco Hospital where he is in a stable condition.MuÌ±oz indicated that this is the 3rd case of a child [infected] by the virus in TonosÌ , which has led to initiating a clean up of the primary school, which will be done today and tomorrow [21, 22 Aug 2017], where classes have been suspended for these 2 days.With this case, the Los Santos province has registered 9 cases of fever and 2 of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.[byline: Zenaida Vasquez]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Apparently, the primary school is the site where the child is suspected to have acquired a hantavirus infection. The school clean-up is prudent, but no mention is made about the presence of rodent hosts there. One presumes that the school grounds will also be cleaned up.There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this case or previous cases. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55286>. - Mod.TY]
