Texas Department of State Health Services [edited]<http://www.dshs.texas.gov/news/releases/2017/20170814.aspx>Unpasteurized milk recall from Wise County dairy------------------------------------------------The Texas Department of State Health Services [DSHS] is working with a specific raw milk dairy in Wise County to recall raw, or unpasteurized, milk due to laboratory evidence that it contains harmful bacteria. DSHS is investigating additional illnesses that may be connected to this product and advising people who consumed milk from this dairy since 1 Jun 2017 to consult with their health care provider.A person who drank milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas has been hospitalized for an infection of a strain of the _Brucella_ bacterium. The patient's only known exposure is through the raw milk, and milk samples taken at that dairy have also tested positive for _Brucella_. The dairy, which is cooperating fully with the investigation, is contacting customers and telling them to discard any milk they have on hand. Because the dairy does not have record of all customers, DSHS is alerting the public about the recall. The department has also issued a health alert asking health care providers to be aware of possible _Brucella_ infections in patients, ask about the consumption of raw milk if considering a _Brucella_ diagnosis, and order appropriate diagnostic testing._Brucella_ can cause a range of symptoms including fever, sweats, headache, muscle and joint pain, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Symptoms can persist for a long time or may come and go repeatedly. Less common symptoms include inflammation of the heart, swelling of the liver and spleen, neurologic symptoms, and in pregnant women, miscarriage. Pregnant women, very young children, older adults, and people with suppressed immune systems are at an increased risk of serious illness due to _Brucella_.People who consumed milk from K-Bar Dairy since 1 Jun 2017 are considered to be at high risk of brucellosis and should contact their health care provider and explain the situation. DSHS recommends testing people with symptoms who consumed the product and treating those who test positive. People who consumed milk from this dairy but have no symptoms should discuss the issue with their provider and monitor themselves for fever and other symptoms.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/36946>. Wise County in north central Texas can be seen on the map at <http://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThis 2nd release from Texas Department of State Health Services underscores the relationship of the dairy's unpasteurized milk and the illness by stating that milk samples also yielded _Brucella_(the ""smoking"" gun). Additionally, additional illnesses are also being evaluated.The species of _Brucella_ identified has not been stated. Classically, _B. abortus_ is associated with cattle but campaigns to eradicate _B. abortus_ from cattle in the USA which began in 1934 have been quite successful. In 2011, commenting on a cluster of _B. abortus_ in cattle in Starr County, Texas (<http://www.southwestfarmpress.com/livestock/texas-discovers-cattle-brucellosis-infected-herd>) it was stated that, ""Currently, the only known reservoir for bovine brucellosis in the United States is in elk and bison in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) located in parts of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming."" With that in mind, ProMED would like confirmation of the species of brucellosis identified and whether goat's milk was the source rather than cow's milk as _B. melitensis_ could be the organism. In a past report of brucellosis from cow's milk in the USA (Brucellosis, human - USA (03): (MA), unpasteurized milk, NOT 20120128.1024159), further evaluation of the organism revealed it not to be _Brucella_ at all. - Mod.LLWhile the species of _Brucella_ has not been released, it is not necessarily _B. abortus_. This would have other serious animal impacts regarding movement of beef and/or dairy animals. Texas Animal Health Commission has not released a statement regarding _B. abortus_ infected animals. They are usually very quick to make an announcement. However, it is possible the _Brucella_ species in the milk may be _B. suis_. While _B. suis_ is generally thought to infect pigs, it has been shown to infect cattle as well. This occurs especially as the wild hogs circulate through grazing pastures and may come in contact with cattle. Other states have also had issues with _B. suis_ appearing in bovines. - Mod.TG]
