Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-yellowfever-monkeys-idUSKBN15N1W9>An outbreak of yellow fever has claimed the lives of more than 600 monkeys and dozens of humans in Brazil's Atlantic rainforest region, threatening the survival of rare South American primates, a zoologist said on Wednesday [8 Feb 2017].The monkeys, mostly brown howlers and masked titis, are falling out of trees and dying on the ground in the forests of Espirito Santo state in Brazil's southeast.""The number of dead monkeys increases every day,"" said Sergio Lucena of the impact of the disease's spread in his state, ""We now know that the rare buffy-headed marmoset is also threatened by the yellow fever virus and is dying.""The howler's sounds closely resemble grunts or barks. It was the silence that fell on the forests that 1st alerted farmers that something was amiss, sparking specialists to investigate.The masked titi is considered as ""vulnerable"" by the Swiss-based International Union for Conservation of Nature, which has placed it on its Red List of Threatened Species.No evidence has so far surfaced of the affliction felling woolly spider monkeys, considered one of the world's most endangered by the IUCN.Brazil is suffering the worst yellow fever outbreak in decades that has killed at least 69 humans, nearly all in central state of Minas Gerais, where the problems began.Most people recover from yellow fever after the 1st phase of infection, which usually involves fever, headache, shivers, loss of appetite and nausea or vomiting, according to the World Health Organization.Millions of Brazilians have been vaccinated as health authorities scramble to prevent the outbreak from turning into an epidemic. There is no such protection available for monkeys.Yellow fever is a viral disease found in tropical regions of Africa and the Americas that mainly affects humans and monkeys and is transmitted by the same type of mosquito that spreads dengue and the Zika virus.Hundreds of thousands of people died from it in the Americas before a vaccine was developed in 1938.Brazil's federal health officials are investigating whether the latest outbreak is linked to a tailings dam collapse last year [2016] in Minas Gerais at the Samarco iron ore mine co-owned by BHP Billiton and Vale SA.The dam accident, which polluted the Rio Doce river, is regarded as the country's worst environmental disaster.Some scientists have said that the calamity may have made the monkeys more susceptible to contracting yellow fever by decimating their habitat and food supplies.[Byline: Anthony Boadle]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The concern for adverse effects on monkey populations due to the yellow fever outbreak is serious. An earlier report indicated that 400 monkeys have been found dead in the forest in EspÌ rito Santo state (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20170201.4806487). Now, the estimate is 600 dead monkeys. That earlier report stated that the greatest risk for adverse population effects is the muriqui monkey, Brazil's largest primate and one of the planet's 25 most-endangered species of primates. The comment following stated that there are 2 species of muriqui monkey in Brazil: the northern muriqui (_Brachyteles hypoxanthus_) that has been on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Critically Endangered list for more than 25 years, and the southern muriqui (_Brachyteles arachnoides_), which has been placed on that list more recently. The above report indicates that brown howler monkeys (_(Alouatta guariba_) and masked titis (_Callicebus personatus_) are the non-human primates most affected in this outbreak. However, the buffy-headed marmoset (_Callithrix flaviceps_) is also mentioned. It is a rare species of marmoset endemic to the rainforests of south-eastern Brazil and occurs in southern EspÌ rito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro, and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais, the very areas where yellow fever is occurring.Images of brown howler monkeys can be accessed at <http://www.walkingtheamazon.com/conserving-monkeys-to-save-humans> and masked titis at <http://www.birdholidays.co.uk/BRAZIL%20pix/2013%20SE%20Brazil/DSC04826%20Masked%20Titi%20Monkey.JPG>.
