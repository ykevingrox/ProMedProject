Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/germany-hantavirus-increase-reported-baden-wurttemberg-19772/>Health officials in Baden-WÌ rttemberg state in southwest Germany are reporting an increase in hantavirus cases this year, especially since March 2017, according to a Stuttgarter-Nachrichten report.A total of 441 hantavirus cases have been reported to date, which is higher than in the past 4 years.Rodents like the RÌ¦telmaus [bank vole, _Myodes glareolus_], carry the hantavirus in itself, the report notes. Through contact with infected animals or their feces and urine excretions, the viruses enter the human organism.According to the state health authority, the Swabian Alb, the Albvorland, the NeckargÌ u and Tauber plateaus, as well as Odenwald and Oberschwaben, have the highest rates of disease.Landesgesundheitsamt, or the National Health Office say those at most risk include those cleaning cellars and roofs, forestry workers and gardeners.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although not stated in the above report, the hantavirus most likely involved in these cases is Puumala virus, with the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_) as the rodent reservoir host. Puumala virus is endemic to south western and western Germany. The Puumala virus (PUUV) outbreaks in the past have been related to increases in the bank vole population. The vole population increases are due in large part to increases in beech tree mast (tree seeds) abundance, with PUUV outbreaks occurring a year after peak mast production. Bank voles are widely distributed across Europe.An image of _Myodes glareolus_, the Puumala virus host, can be accessed at <http://grzanka.pl/2010/03/03/nornica-ruda-myodes-glareolus/>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/61077>.]
