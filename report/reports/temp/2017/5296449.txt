The Times of Israel [edited]<https://www.timesofisrael.com/public-urged-to-trash-eggs-after-salmonella-found/>The health and agriculture ministries on [Tue 5 Sep 2017] called on the public not to buy or use eggs sold by ""Yesh Maof"" that bear a sell-by date of up to and including [20 Oct 2017], following the discovery of salmonella in a part of the company's laying sheds at Moshav Goren in the northern Israeli Galilee.Some 11 million suspect eggs have already reached the market.Eggs already at home should be thrown into the trash and not returned to the retailer, the Health Ministry said.The salmonella came to light during a routine inspection of sheds at Moshav Goren carried out by Agriculture Ministry inspectors. One shed was definitely infected by salmonella, the Hebrew-language The Marker news site said. Another was clean, and a further 2 were still being inspected.According to the Health Ministry, inspectors have already checked 60 percent of laying sheds in the country as part of a rolling program to control salmonella, but have found the bacteria in less than 3 percent of them.In May [2017], the Health Ministry announced a recent rise in salmonella poisoning in Israel and in 14 European countries. Eggs are suspected as the source of the poisoning, whose symptoms include stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea.The bacteria enter the food chain in 2 ways: from outside, when laying hens come into contact with dead birds, excrement or other pollutants; and internally, when the bacteria pass from the hens' reproductive systems straight to the eggs.Children, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems are particularly susceptible.[Byline: Sue Surkes]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Tue 5 Sep 2017Source: Haaretz daily [edited]<http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.810694>The Israeli Health and Agriculture Ministries are calling on members of the public not to consume a record 11 million eggs on the market that have been tainted with a virulent strain of salmonella.The eggs were sold through a firm called Yesh Maof, government sources said. The 2 Ministries are calling on the public not to consume any of the company's eggs that are stamped for consumption up to and including [20 Oct 2017].In an effort to avoid secondary infection, members of the public are being asked not to return any affected eggs to food retailers and to instead simply destroy them. Salmonella can be present on egg cartons, and the government is concerned that returning them to the distributor could simply encourage further spread of the bacteria.The salmonella contamination - of the Enteritidis strain - was discovered through routine Agriculture Ministry inspections conducted in recent months. It coincided with Health Ministry findings of an increase in the incidence of salmonella in the country.The infected eggs apparently came from chicken coops at Moshav Goren in Western Galilee. It has been confirmed that 1 coop has definitely been affected, and 2 others in the vicinity are being checked.The Agriculture Ministry has banned the sale of eggs produced in 4 coops there and plans to destroy the chickens as well.The ministry has inspected about 60 percent of all egg farms in the country and found that about 3 percent of them were infected with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis, which it said has a lower rate of contamination than is found in Europe and the United States.Although the general approach of the Agriculture Ministry is that salmonella bacteria are destroyed by heat and therefore it recommends that all eggs be thoroughly cooked, in this case the Health Ministry has ordered the eggs be destroyed and has informed Agriculture Ministry staff there are no grounds for compromise.The farmers whose chickens are to be destroyed will receive compensation from a special fund. It is not yet clear if and how consumers will be compensated.[Byline:  Ora Coren]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is, to the best of our knowledge, the 1st time an official large-scale recall of marketed table-eggs is applied in Israel. So far, a recall of table eggs in Israel has been regarded as infeasible because the eggs cannot be traced back to the producer's site. Eggs are stamped in the ""egg collection centers"" (ECC, ""egg sorting centers"" or ""packing centers""), as prescribed by the existing Ministry of Health legislation. The stamp includes dates and the name (in Hebrew) and license number of the ECC, but there is no requirement for the identification of the producer (namely the farm/village where the eggs originate from). The dates relate to the day the egg was produced and recommended final dates for their consumption.The name of the ECC involved in the current event is ""Yesh Maof"" (license number 559), situated in Moshav Goren in the Western Galilee. This ECC is included among the 27 nationally licensed ECC's, specified in the list as no 18. The updated list is available at <https://foodinspection.org/establishmentTypereport.aspx> (in Hebrew).From a reliable, unofficial source we have learned that the discovery of the source of human infection with _S._ Enteritidis by contaminated eggs became possible during a recent epidemiological investigation of the Ministry of Health, addressing several diagnosed human cases. Visits to the kitchens/refrigerators of the victims discovered in all, or most of them, eggs bearing the name of ECC ""Yesh Maof"". This led to visits, cooperatively performed with the Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture), to the named ECC and to its suppliers. _S._ Enteritidis was detected on the premises of one of the country's largest laying farms, a supplier of Yesh Maof. In the absence of identification of the farm on the marketed eggs, the huge (in Israeli terms) recall had to be applied, affecting eggs from all suppliers of the involved ECC.An official confirmation of the above information (or a corrective, detailed, professional, firsthand report) from the Ministry of Health will be much appreciated.Adult chickens carry salmonella, including _S._ Enteritidis and other serotypes which may be of significant pathogenicity for humans, without -- in the majority of cases -- any disease in the animals. The animal health may remain unaffected: no morbidity/mortality, no direct losses to the owners. Disease in young chicks, however, may occur (there are no chicks on laying farms). It is indeed this situation which leads to difficulties in the implementation of control measures on the farm, since such measures, while requiring the cooperation (and financial participation) of the owner, are meant to protect public health, not animal health. Since March 2003, vaccination against _S._ Enteritidis, of pullets bred for the egg laying industry, has become compulsory in Israel. Its wide application since is believed to have reduced the incidence of this pathogen. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.]
