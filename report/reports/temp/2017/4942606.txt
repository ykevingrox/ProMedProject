Association of acute toxic encephalopathy with litchi consumption in an outbreak in Muzaffarpur, India, 2014: a case-control study.---------------------------------------------------SummaryBackgroundOutbreaks of unexplained illness frequently remain under-investigated. In India, outbreaks of an acute neurological illness with high mortality among children occur annually in Muzaffarpur, the country's largest litchi cultivation region. In 2014, we aimed to investigate the cause and risk factors for this illness.MethodsIn this hospital-based surveillance and nested age-matched case-control study, we did laboratory investigations to assess potential infectious and non-infectious causes of this acute neurological illness. Cases were children aged 15 years or younger who were admitted to 2 hospitals in Muzaffarpur with new-onset seizures or altered sensorium. Age-matched controls were residents of Muzaffarpur who were admitted to the same 2 hospitals for a non-neurologic illness within 7 days of the date of admission of the case. Clinical specimens (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine) and environmental specimens (litchis) were tested for evidence of infectious pathogens, pesticides, toxic metals, and other non-infectious causes, including presence of hypoglycin A or methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), naturally-occurring fruit-based toxins that cause hypoglycaemia and metabolic derangement. Matched and unmatched (controlling for age) bivariate analyses were done and risk factors for illness were expressed as matched odds ratios and odds ratios (unmatched analyses).FindingsBetween 26 May-17 Jul 2014, 390 patients meeting the case definition were admitted to the 2 referral hospitals in Muzaffarpur, of whom 122 (31 percent) died. On admission, 204 (62 percent) of 327 had blood glucose concentration of 70 mg/dL or less. 104 cases were compared with 104 age-matched hospital controls. Litchi consumption (matched odds ratio [mOR] 9.6 [95 percent CI 3.6 - 24]) and absence of an evening meal (2.2 [1.2-4.3]) in the 24 [hours] preceding illness onset were associated with illness. The absence of an evening meal significantly modified the effect of eating litchis on illness (odds ratio [OR] 7.8 [95 percent CI 3.3-18.8], without evening meal; OR 3.6 [1.1-11.1] with an evening meal). Tests for infectious agents and pesticides were negative. Metabolites of hypoglycin A, MCPG, or both were detected in 48 [66 percent] of 73 urine specimens from case-patients and none from 15 controls; 72 (90 percent) of 80 case-patient specimens had abnormal plasma acylcarnitine profiles, consistent with severe disruption of fatty acid metabolism. In 36 litchi arils tested from Muzaffarpur, hypoglycin A concentrations ranged from 12.4 ug/g to 152.0 ug/g and MCPG ranged from 44.9 ug/g to 220.0 ug/g.InterpretationOur investigation suggests an outbreak of acute encephalopathy in Muzaffarpur associated with both hypoglycin A and MCPG toxicity. To prevent illness and reduce mortality in the region, we recommended minimising litchi consumption, ensuring receipt of an evening meal and implementing rapid glucose correction for suspected illness. A comprehensive investigative approach in Muzaffarpur led to timely public health recommendations, underscoring the importance of using systematic methods in other unexplained illness outbreaks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[At last, we have a convincing diagnosis, lychee fruit intoxication, for some of the previously undiagnosed cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) not attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE). Cases of JE, as well as the undetermined AES, occur in Behar and northeastern India every year, mainly from March-August.AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus ( _O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. One hopes that the information in the above report will be widely disseminated among health care professionals so that timely diagnosis and effective treatment can be provided and many children's lives saved.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299>, and a district map of Bihar can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/bihar/bihar-district.htm>. - Mod.TY]
