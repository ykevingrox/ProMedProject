HBV is also commonly transmitted perinatally, HCV much less so. Both HBV and HCV remain significant causes of chronic liver disease manifested by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. Preventing these diseases relates to prevention of primary infection via the HBV vaccine and strong efforts to minimize transmission by safe sexual practices, and prevention of injection-associated transmission, and treatment, which is most useful at this point in HCV.Maps of Pakistan can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>. - Mod.LL]
