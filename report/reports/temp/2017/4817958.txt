Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/nepal-13-leprosy-cases-reported-palpa-25247/>The Palpa District [Province Five] Public Health Office (DPHO) reported this week [week of 30 Jan 2017] on 13 new leprosy cases in the central Nepal district, according to a Kathmandu Post report. About 16 cases are reported annually in the district.The number of leprosy patients taking drugs has reached 13 in the district so far and of them 8 patients have completed drugs, the DPHO said.According to the WHO, there were more than 200 000 new cases reported globally in 2015.Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae._ The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Leprosy is curable and treatment provided in the early stages averts disability. Multidrug therapy, made available by WHO free of charge to all patients worldwide since 1995, provides a simple yet highly effective cure for all types of leprosy.The Nepalese government has the aim to eliminate the disease by 2020 and has launched a campaign to seek and treat patients of leprosy in various districts in the country.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The 13 new cases of leprosy in the Palpa district is likely the result of more intensive case finding. Nepal achieved what WHO refers to as ""the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem"" (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in 2010, after achieving a prevalence rate of 0.89 per 10 000 people nationally. However, leprosy has obviously not been completely eradicated in Nepal. In 2015, Nepal reported a prevalence of 2427 cases of leprosy in a national population of about 28 million residents (a prevalence rate of 0.87 per 10 0000) (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/249601/1/WER9135.pdf>).Nepal was among the 14 countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in 2015 (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/249601/1/WER9135.pdf>). However, the number of new cases has gradually fallen over a 10-year period from the 6150 cases reported in 2005 (1) to 2751 new cases in 2015. Of the 2751 new cases in 2015, 1487 (54 percent) had multibacillary leprosy, which is an indication of the proportion of new cases with contagious disease in the community; 197 (7.2 percent) occurred in children, which is an indication of ongoing disease transmission; and 119 (4.3 percent) had chronic deformities and disability, which reflects problems in case finding (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/249601/1/WER9135.pdf>).Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_. This disease is still a major health problem in the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Western Pacific region. Transmission is thought to occur following close, prolonged contact with a case of lepromatous (multibacillary) leprosy, usually within a household setting. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease.A newly described leprosy agent, named _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_, was discovered in 2008 in patients who died of diffuse lepromatous leprosy (DLL) (see <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19019760> and ProMED-mail post Leprosy, new species - USA, Mexico, Singapore 20081126.3723). DLL is a unique severe form of leprosy that has been endemic in Mexico and Costa Rica for more than a century.Because lepromatous patients excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions, the mode of spread is likely respiratory or nasal discharge. As the organism is also present in skin lesions of patients with lepromatous leprosy, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Fomites are an additional potential source of infection. _M. leprae_ can persist on surfaces in the environment (2), and _M. leprae_ from the environment and the patients have been found to exhibit the same genotype (3).References----------1.

Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months, and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.
