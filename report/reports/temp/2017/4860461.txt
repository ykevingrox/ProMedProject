Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mumps-reported-penn-state-campus-advised-30144/>Penn State University Health Services (UHS) is reporting that 2 cases of mumps have been confirmed on the University Park campus.The students were isolated in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Pennsylvania Department of Health protocols and recommendations, and UHS staff have been in touch with those who have been in close contact with the individuals. The Pennsylvania Department of Health is monitoring the situation.Mumps is a highly infectious disease passed through saliva and respiratory secretions. Symptoms often include tender swollen glands below the ear or along the jawline on one or both sides of the face and neck, headache, fever and cold-like symptoms. People with mumps are considered infectious from 2 days before swelling begins through 5 days after the start of swelling. For most people, 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine provide adequate immunity to the infection.University Health Services, a unit of Penn State Student Affairs, advises the following:All students, faculty and staff should check with their health care providers to confirm receipt of 2 doses of the MMR vaccine after their 1st birthday. Anyone who does not have immunity to mumps either through receipt of the 2-dose MMR vaccine or a previous mumps infection, should schedule an appointment to receive the vaccine.All students who have not already done so are advised to request a copy of their immunization information from their private healthcare provider to be faxed to University Health Services. During a mumps outbreak, anyone who does not have proof of vaccination may be excluded from campus until 25 days after the last possible date of infection.Avoid sharing food and drinks, engaging in drinking games, or other activities that may result in saliva exposure. In addition, frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette are also helpful in preventing the spread of this and many other diseases.Although the 2-dose MMR series is highly effective for most people, it is important to remember that no vaccine is 100 percent effective for every person. Unfortunately, there is not a good way to determine who has not developed immunity from the 2-dose vaccine series.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the United States showing the location of Pennsylvania can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/227>]******[2] USA (Missouri) RFIDate: Mon 13 Feb 2017 5:12 p.m. CTSource: News Leader [edited]<http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/education/2017/02/13/and-then-there-were-5-another-sps-student-tests-positive-mumps/97871010/>A 5th case of mumps has been confirmed among Springfield Public Schools students.In a [Mon 13 Feb 2017] alert, the district informed parents that a student at Westport Middle School had contracted the contagious disease, which is caused by a virus.It came 72 hours after a Friday alert that a student at Carver Middle School also had the mumps.They join 3 other students -- one at Central High School and 2 at Bissett Elementary -- who tested positive for mumps earlier this school year [September 2016]. The 3 lived in the same household.Westport and Bissett are in northwest Springfield, Central is in Midtown and Carver is in the southwest.University of Missouri reports 31 confirmed mumps cases. Mumps typically includes a fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and swollen salivary glands.The Springfield-Greene County Health Department has not yet declared a mumps ""outbreak"" in the area, noting there is no evidence to suggest a ""person-to-person"" spread locally.Kendra Findley, administrator of community health and epidemiology, said all 5 of the cases have been linked to an outbreak in northwest Arkansas.A confirmed mumps case is fairly rare because most individuals have built up an immunity to the disease.The vaccine has been around since the 1950s and includes 2 shots, the 1st when a child is a toddler and the 2nd toward the end of elementary school.The first 3 Springfield students to test positive, the ones who belonged to the same family, had all taken the vaccine. It is not yet clear if the Carver or Westport students had taken the shots.""Most of the ones we've dealt with so far have been immunized,"" Findley said.She said the outbreak in northwest Arkansas involves a virus with a ""strain or genotype"" that is a little different and has been contracted by individuals who have been vaccinated.There is no known treatment for mumps but children typically recover fully in a few weeks. However, there can be serious consequences for adults who contract the disease. She said adults can develop swelling in the brain, ovaries or testicles. That can cause infertility and even death.In the district's health alert, officials stated that if an outbreak is declared, students that have not yet been vaccinated for mumps may be ""excluded"" or told to stay home for up to 26 days.The district is required to track and report vaccine compliance. At this point, 98 percent of students have received the recommended vaccines based on their age. The other 2 percent have sought medical or religious exemptions.The Springfield district, in collaboration with the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, urged families interested in obtaining the immunization to contact their health care provider.[Byline: Claudette Riley]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report states that all 5 cases have been linked to an outbreak in northwest Arkansas.  The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) reported in November 2016 that in that outbreak, 90 to 95 percent of school-aged children and 30 to 40 percent of adults had been fully immunized.This prompted health officials to look at the effectiveness of the mumps portion of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. According to state epidemiologist, Dirk Haselow, MD, PhD, the mumps strain seen in Arkansas is the most genetically distinct from the type used to make the vaccine. Haselow said the strain of the virus making the rounds may have evolved enough to surmount the vaccine, though he added that this hasn't yet been confirmed.

The city says 14 people have been confirmed to have mumps, which is highly contagious and can sicken people for 10 daysToronto Public Health is warning the public about an outbreak of mumps that may be spreading in downtown bars.The agency is investigating 14 lab-confirmed cases of the contagious disease, and other cases under investigation, with all those sickened between the ages of 18 and 35.""The investigation to date has identified that many of these cases have frequented bars in the west downtown core of Toronto. This may be a contributing factor in the circulation of this viral infection,"" the release states.The mumps virus, found in saliva and respiratory droplets, is spread through coughing, sneezing, and coming into contact with saliva by kissing or sharing drinks, utensils, food or water bottles.""A major factor contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team or living in a dormitory with a person who has the mumps,"" public health says,The risk to the general public from the infection is ""low"" but people with concerns are advised to check the immunization records of themselves and family members.Mumps symptoms include: swelling and pain in salivary glands in the sides of cheeks and jaw; fever; headache; muscle aches and pains; fatigue; and loss of appetite. Symptoms can last up to 10 days.Complications can include encephalitis, an infection in the brain; meningitis, an infection in the lining of the brain; painful swelling of the testicles or the ovaries; pancreatitis; and hearing loss. Pregnant women who become infected with mumps during the 1st 3 months of pregnancy are at risk of miscarriagePeople who think they have mumps should tell their doctor before arriving at a medical office.Most Torontonians born between 1970 and 1992 have had either 1 or 0 mumps vaccinations. That makes them more susceptible to infection than those born later, most of whom have had 2 vaccinations - at around 12 months of age and then again between the ages 4 and 6.[Byline: David Rider]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Spending leisure time in a crowded bar will contribute to mumps cases if immunity is waning or the individual was not fully vaccinated. - Mod.LK][A map of Ontario Province, Canada can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>]******[4] Canada (Alberta)Date: Wed 22 Feb 2017Source: CBC [edited]<https://ca.news.yahoo.com/6-cases-mumps-reported-medicine-210455829.html>An outbreak of the mumps in the Medicine Hat area has benched several Western Hockey League players, and Alberta Health Services says it's likely just the beginning.According to AHS, there are 9 lab-confirmed cases of mumps the south zone. Seven of those cases are players and coaches with the local WHL team, the Tigers. The other 2 have had direct contact with the team.Vivien Suttorp, lead medical officer of health for southern Alberta, says steps have been taken to contain the spread, which could be province-wide. ""At this point, a lot of that strategy is there's targeted messaging to, for example, hockey teams that might have been exposed,"" said Suttorp.Alberta Health Services has also notified schools and post-secondary institutions across the province and alerted physicians and public health nurses to be on the lookout for symptoms.Hockey teams have been told to ensure locker rooms and equipment is cleaned and to avoid sharing saliva through things like water bottles and towels.Those showing symptoms -- which include low-level fever, headache and swollen facial glands -- should be isolated for 5 days.The 1st player to be diagnosed with the mumps plays for the Brandon Wheat Kings. His case was confirmed on [Tue 7 Feb 2017]. The Tigers' JD was diagnosed just last [Tue 21 Feb 2017].JD's roommate at his billet family's home had to move out as [he] was quarantined with the illness. He returned to the ice last night, and even scored a goal.""From what I heard from the other guys it's been a little bit worse for them than me, so I was a little bit lucky there,"" he said.Coach Shawn Clouston said he hopes the worst is over, but as mumps has a 25-day incubation period, they will have to wait and see.""I think the challenging part is that it does have that long incubation period. I've done so much reading in the past week to try to understand what is going on ... we're hopeful that we're at the end of it.""In a statement, the WHL said they have been working closely with medical staff and health authorities to minimize the spread of the virus.""With the assistance of the health authorities, WHL Clubs' experienced medical and training staff are continuing to ensure sanitization, early detection and quarantine protocols are being followed diligently,"" the statement read.Suttorp said the Medicine Hat area has high vaccination rates, but the rates vary in southern Alberta. CBC News recently reported on vast differences between the communities of Pincher Creek and Fort Macleod.Rates for the mumps, measles and rubella vaccine in Medicine Hat is 89.4 percent.""Of course, there's always worry with mumps, when we see further spread, that it ends up in some of our lower immunized communities and lower immunized schools,"" she said.Those who contract mumps can experience complications including meningitis, inflammation of the testicles and pancreatitis.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Alberta Province, Canada can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/263>][From 1 Jan -- 28 Jan 2017, 27 states in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 495 people to CDC.Mumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were 5311 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States (from CDC).In Canada in the last 10 years there have been outbreaks of mumps mostly among young adults in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Alberta. These outbreaks demonstrate how certain population groups are susceptible to getting mumps due to lack of previous vaccination or incomplete vaccination. Data from Canada, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Finland show that the number of cases of mumps decreased by over 90 percent after mumps vaccine became available. Mumps encephalitis has virtually disappeared from countries with effective vaccination programs.  (<http://www.immunize.ca/en/diseases-vaccines/mumps.aspx>)In spite of the seeming upturn in cases, this is an impressive decrease in incidence of disease due solely to the success of the MMR vaccine. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/263>.]
