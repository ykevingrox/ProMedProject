Jacqueline Weyer <jacquelinew@nicd.ac.za> [edited]A 2nd case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was confirmed in South Africa in 2017, 2 days after the 1st case was identified on [6 Jan 2017] (see archive no. 20170113.4762405). The 2 cases were unrelated.The new case involved a 58-year-old sheep farmer from Van Wyksvlei, a small town in the Upper Karoo, Northern Cape Province. A tick bite history was reported during the 3rd week of December 2016. The patient complained of headache and myalgia on [3 Jan 2017] and was treated with doxycycline for tick bite fever by a local practitioner. On [7 Jan 2017], the patient was admitted to hospital in Kimberley with worsening symptoms and no response following antibiotic treatment. On clinical examination, the patient was noted to have a petechial rash. Marked thrombocytopenia (5000/ml) and raised liver enzyme levels (AST 2616 IU/ml) were noted. The patient was isolated on suspicion of CCHF and administered transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets but died on [8 Jan 2017] following a fatal gastro-intestinal bleed. Blood samples collected on the day of death were tested at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and tested positive for CCHF by RT-PCR. No detectable anti-CCHF antibody responses were found.Monitoring of 17 health care worker contacts (16 clinical staff and a single laboratory technologist) and 3 family contacts is ongoing, however no secondary cases have arisen to date.Since 1981, 202 cases (including the cases reported here) of CCHF have been laboratory-confirmed in South Africa. More than 2/3 of cases report a tick exposure whilst exposure to infected animal tissues and blood are more rarely reported.--Jacqueline WeyerNational Institute for Communicable DiseasesSouth Africa<jacquelinew@nicd.ac.za>[ProMED-mail thanks Jacqueline Weyer for her valuable information on the new human case of CCHF from South Africa. This is the 2nd case reported in 2017 and it was fatal. There is history of occupational risk and tick bite before presentation at the hospital and the case was confirmed in the laboratory by RT-PCR. The 1st case was reported from the Western Cape region in early January 2017.Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases occur sporadically in South Africa, with a yearly average of 5. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is typically transmitted by the so-called ""bontpoot"" ticks, 3 species of _Hyalomma_ ticks (_H. rufipes_, _H. glabrum_, and _H. truncatum_). The legs of these ticks are banded with white. (<http://www.itg.be/photodatabase/African_ticks_files/index.html>). The _Hyalomma_ species, and therefore CCHF virus, occur in the more arid parts of South Africa, particularly on the inland plateau.Serological evidence of human infection with CCHF is uncommon, despite the widespread and high prevalence of CCHF virus antibodies amongst sheep, cattle, and hares throughout South Africa. A serosurveillance study conducted in the 1980s found high antibody prevalence to CCHF virus in cattle herds in the interior of the country, with over 90 percent in some herds, while the seroprevalence was less than 4 percent in cattle in the coastal region between Cape Town and East London. Only 17/1109 (1.5 percent) of human residents on 55 farms had antibodies to CCHF, while no veterinary staff engaged in farm animal practice were CCHF seropositive (Swanepoel R, Shepherd AJ, Leman PA, Shepherd SP: Investigations following initial recognition of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in South Africa and the diagnosis of 2 further cases.
