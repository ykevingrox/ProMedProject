New York Daily News [edited]<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/inmates-ohio-prison-diagnosed-legionnaires-disease-article-1.3291473>Two inmates at Ohio's prison hospital have been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, causing the facility this week to cut off use of its tap water and install new faucets and filters. Environmental tests have been done in hopes of finding the source of illnesses at the Franklin Medical Center in Columbus, prison officials said. The prison hospital houses close to 600 inmates who need medical and long-term care, some who may be more vulnerable to Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia that in some cases can be fatal. The prison also has pregnant inmates. A notice sent by the prison's warden earlier this week after the 2nd illness was confirmed said inmates were not to use the showers and advised against drinking the water. A 2nd, separate section of the prison wasn't affected. Bottled water was being handed out to inmates and the prison's 500 staff members. Most of the faucets and showers now are safe to use after new filters were installed over the past few days, according to an internal memo sent Thursday [29 Jun 2017] and obtained by The Associated Press. Some of the faucets will require special fittings and still were not safe to use, the notice said. Both the male inmates who were diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease have pre-existing health conditions, said JoEllen Smith, a spokeswoman for the prisons department. The union representing workers at the prison said the 2 men who were sickened were in an area near each other.--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his submission.Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhaling aerosolized _Legionella_, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients, and possible by person-to-person transmission has been described (Correia AM, GonÌ¤alves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease.
