Ripples Nigeria [edited]<https://www.ripplesnigeria.com/seven-suspected-monkey-pox-cases-recorded-abuja/>The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) on Thursday [12 Oct 2017] revealed that 7 suspected cases of dreaded monkeypox have been recorded in 4 hospitals in Abuja, with samples of 6 victims taken and sent to Senegal for testing and confirmation. This was disclosed by the Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS) of FCTA, Amanda Pam, while briefing newsmen on Thursday [12 Oct 2017].It has in the meantime denied rumours that there is an outbreak of monkeypox in Abuja in the nation's capital. According to the Secretary, ""3 suspected cases were recorded in National Hospital, 2 in Gwarinpa Hospital, one each in University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada and Nyanya General Hospital.""She said the recorded cases were that of chickenpox, which shares a similar appearance to monkeypox. On Wednesday [11 Oct 2017], there were a rumoured 2 cases of monkeypox at Gwarinpa General Hospital, Abuja.""Though we have some suspected cases, samples were collected and sent to the lab, so we are waiting for the results, but from all indications, it is not monkeypox. But I think I like the suspicion, because it's better to suspect than to ignore it and it later turns out to be positive. The truth now is that there is no confirmed case of monkeypox disease in FCT,"" she stressed.Explaining further, Acting Director, Public Health, FCT Humphrey Okoroukwu disclosed that he had already visited the said hospital on Wednesday [11 Oct 2017], reaffirming that no case of the virus was found.He said surveillance officers from the public health department of the FCTA are being deployed to the 62 wards of the territory, as a precautionary measure against threatening health issues.The federal government had, through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Monday [9 Oct 2017], confirmed a suspected outbreak of monkeypox in 7 states in Nigeria, which included Bayelsa, Rivers, Ekiti, Akwa Ibom, Lagos, Ogun and Cross River states.Meanwhile, the National Coordinator, National Centre For Disease Control (NCDC) Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu on Thursday [12 Oct 2017] informed lawmakers that 33 cases of monkeypox infection had been reported in 7 states of the federation. The NCDC scribe said that 17 out of the number manifested in Bayelsa state alone. According to him, other states where the disease has manifested are Rivers, Ekiti, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Lagos, and Ogun. He, however, pointed out that it was not certain whether all the victims reported to have been afflicted by monkeypox were actually infected by the virus or by other diseases with similar symptoms.Senators have also described as a national embarrassment and shame the lack of a public diagnostic centre for detection of the current outbreak in some states of the federation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretariat indicated that the 7 cases in the 4 hospitals were chickenpox, not monkeypox. The diagnosis of chickenpox apparently was made on the basis of clinical presentation. She pointed out that the clinical picture of chickenpox and monkeypox were similar but she implied are differentiable. The status of the other cases in the 7 states reported as monkeypox have not been laboratory confirmed yet.As noted in comments in the previous posts, laboratory confirmation of the 31 suspected monkeypox cases is essential. Rapid appearance of the disease across 7 states in less than 3 weeks is unusual for monkeypox. Isolated and scattered cases are more common. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). The current outbreak appears to be more characteristic of direct transmission between individuals rather than spillover from a wild rodent reservoir, raising the question about involvement of some other transmissible pathogen such as varicella (chickenpox).Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
