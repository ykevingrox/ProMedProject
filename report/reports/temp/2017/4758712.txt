Number of human cases: None reported to date.4. Recommendations for affected countries and those at risk:FAO recommends intensified surveillance and awareness raising by national authorities.There is no benefit to be gained in attempting to control the virus in wild birds through culling or habitat destruction. Spraying of birds or the environment with disinfectant -- for example sodium hypochlorite or bleach -- is considered potentially counter-productive, harmful to the environment and not effective from a disease control perspective.There is also no justification for any preemptive culling of endangered species in zoological collections. Control measures for captive wild birds in places where virus is detected should be based on strict movement control, isolation and only when necessary limited culling of affected birds.There is also no justification for any preemptive culling of endangered species in zoological collections. Control measures for captive wild birds in places where virus is detected should be based on strict movement control, isolation and only when necessary limited culling of affected birds.5. General recommendationsIt is important to report sick or dead birds -- both wild birds and poultry -- to local authorities (veterinary services, public health officials, community leaders etc.). These should be tested for avian influenza viruses.Wash hands properly and often. You should always do so after handling birds or other animals, when cooking or preparing animal products, and before eating.Eat only well-cooked meat products, and refrain from collecting, consuming or selling animals found sick or dead.Seek immediate advice from your physician if you show signs of fever after being in contact with poultry, farmed birds, wild birds or other animals.6. Recommendations to poultry producersFarmers and poultry producers should step up their biosecurity measures in order to prevent potential virus introduction from wild birds or their faeces.It is important to keep poultry and other animals away from wild birds and their sub-products or droppings through screens, fencing or nets.Commercial poultry operations and backyard poultry owners should avoid the introduction of pathogens through contaminated clothes, footwear, vehicles or equipment used in waterfowl hunting.7. Recommendations to huntersHunting associations and wildlife authorities should be aware that H5N8 and other avian influenza viruses might be present in waterfowl hunted during fall migration 2016, and that hunting, handling, and dressing of shot waterfowl carries the risk of spreading avian influenza viruses to susceptible poultry.Avoid introduction of avian influenza viruses to poultry through fomites (clothing, boots, vehicles, etc.) and do not feed wild bird scraps to poultry.Water bird scraps should not be fed to domestic animals (cats, dogs, or poultry).Any waste from hunted birds should be treated as potentially contaminated and safely disposed of.8. Recommendations to national authoritiesIncrease surveillance efforts for the early detection of H5N8 and other influenza viruses in poultry and dead wild birds.Provide means for reporting sick or dead birds, e.g. hotlines and collection points.Raise awareness of the general population, poultry producers or marketers and hunters both about the disease as well as the reporting mechanisms for sick or dead birds.Collaborate with hunting associations for laboratory testing of hunted birds, especially in areas that are known to be affected.Provide means for and ensure proper disposal of carcasses after sample collection.Ensure that the means for laboratory testing are in place to detect the currently circulating avian influenza viruses, especially those of clade 2.3.4.4.Gene sequencing should be performed for all H5 viruses detected and results shared with the global community in a timely manner. This will aid understanding of how the virus is spreading.Action on wild birds not recommended.9. Map 1. H5N8 HPAI outbreaks officially reported in Asia, Europe and Africa by onset date, since 1 Jun 2016.(available at <http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/H5N8/img/map1_2017_01_09.jpg>).Reference: Pohlmann A, Starick E, Harder T, HÌ¦per D, Globig A, Staubach C, et al. Outbreaks among wild birds and domestic poultry caused by reassorted influenza A(H5N8) clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, Germany, 2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017 Apr [ahead of print]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2304.161949. A new reassortant influenza A(H5N8) virus is responsible for the recent HPAIV outbreak in Germany. The observed differences in pathogenicity for a broad spectrum of waterfowl compared with that of H5N8 viruses from 2014-2015 correlate with a new genome composition of these viruses. These new strains may be more efficiently transmitted by and shed to other wild and domestic birds, a hypothesis in line with the large number of cases among wild birds in November 2016 [Other references included as well; see source URL].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Subscribers are encouraged to visit also the comprehensive scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare published by the European Food Safety Agency, adopted on 14 Dec 2016, published in EFSA Journal No 1, 2017, accessible at <https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/4687.pdf>. - Mod.AS]******[2] Italy, H5N8 and H5N5, wild birdsDate: Wed 11 Jan 2016Source: PoultryMed [edited]<http://www.poultrymed.com/Poultrymed/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=178&FID=1908&PID=0&IID=47263>On 10 Jan 2017, a 2nd positivity to avian influenza A virus subtype H5N5 was confirmed [in Italy] in wild birds. The virus was detected in a gadwall (_Anas strepera_) found dead in the municipality of Grado, in close proximity to wetlands. Further analysis to characterize the virus is ongoing.On 5 Jan 2017, the National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease (NRL) confirmed a new positivity to high pathogenicity avian influenza virus subtype H5N8 in a Eurasian wigeon (_Anas Penelope_) found dead in Grado lagoon in Friuli Venezia Giulia region. The NRL communicated the results of phylogenetic analysis on the HPAI virus subtype H5N5 identified on 28 Dec 2016: The virus clusters with H5N8 viruses found in Europe, Russia, Mongolia, India & China during 2016 and shows higher similarity with 2 viruses identified in Poland in December 2016.On 28 Dec 2016, the NRL confirmed as positive to HPAI H5N5 samples obtained from organs of a wild bird found dead in Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. The positive bird was a Eurasian wigeon (_Anas Penelope_) collected along with other 2 ducks of the same species in Grado lagoon, a wetland in Gorizia province. Further analysis of the detected virus is ongoing.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[HPAI is currently spreading also in West Africa, namely Nigeria. According to a media report dated 10 Jan 2016: ""A new strain of the bird flu virus (H5N8) was reported in Kano. The new strain is believed to be very pathogenic and more devastating to poultry species and, therefore, may add to the burdens of the strain (H5N1) that is currently circulating the country"" <http://leadership.ng/news/566676/3-5m-birds-currently-affected-by-bird-flu-in-nigeria-ogbeh>.The following comment/query received recently from a correspondent is being shared with subscribers:""The UK is insisting even backyard farmers move their birds inside. Given the small risk to humans, the question rises if the precautions reflect a concern that H5N8 could re-assort with a human flu as the winter flu season draws on. Is that a major worry?"" - Mod.AS]
