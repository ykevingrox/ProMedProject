It indicates that ST is becoming more common in Kathmandu than we previously thought. It raises a critical question whether ST is shifting [its] geographic range or [was] frequently under-diagnosed previously or [was] under-diagnosed in urban areas like Kathmandu; [this] deserves further studies. Because, in the past, [the] majority of scrub typhus cases were reported from non-urban remote areas than urban areas of Nepal.--Communicated by:Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research Unit,Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital,Kathmandu, Nepal.<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for continued contributions to ProMED-mail on scrub typhus in Nepal.Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm>).Maps of Nepal can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/ydf8ojtj> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/139>. - Mod.ML][See Also:Scrub typhus - Nepal (07): (NA, DK) fatal 20170810.5239887Scrub typhus - Nepal (06): (GU, NU) 20170709.5161628Scrub typhus - Nepal (05): (CT, NP) 20170627.5135389Scrub typhus - Nepal (04): (MO, SS) 20170613.5102100Scrub typhus - Nepal (03): (BA) 20170608.5093274Scrub typhus - Nepal (02): (RO) 20170217.4846555Scrub typhus - Nepal: winter season 20170111.47579082016----Scrub typhus - Nepal (10): (CT) fatal, more cases 20161118.4639756Scrub typhus - Nepal (09): (Banke) 20161103.4603729Scrub typhus - Nepal (08): (CT) fatal, more cases 20161010.4549812Scrub typhus - Nepal (07): (DH) hearing loss 20160910.4478353Scrub typhus - Nepal (06): (CT) fatal 20160831.4455863Scrub typhus - Nepal (05): (DH) 20160830.4450349Scrub typhus - Nepal (04): (TN) fatal 20160826.4442332Scrub typhus - Nepal (03): (KT) unusual clinical presentation 20160822.4433568Scrub typhus - Nepal (02): fatal 20160816.4417397Scrub typhus - Nepal: (UD) 20160728.4377598].................................................ml/ec/ml"
