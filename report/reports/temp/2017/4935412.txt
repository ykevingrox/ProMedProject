EYT (The News-Press & Gazette Company of California) [edited]<http://www.keyt.com/health/report-many-california-children-test-positive-for-lead-poisoning/421289524>Dozens of communities in California have children who tested high for lead poisoning including Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. This is according to an investigative report done by Reuters.In the Fresno area, more than 13 percent of blood tests on children under 6 years old came back high for lead.Children poisoned by lead oftentimes don't show symptoms. However, lead poisoning does have concerning consequences.Annual blood tests can't determine the cause of the child's exposure to lead, but common sources are old paint, old plumbing found in homes, contaminated drinking water, and more.[Byline: Vicky Nguyen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[These sound like they are very young children, at least 6 and under, but we are not told exact ages.We are not told in this short article if there are clinical signs of lead poisoning. Either the clinical signs were not recognized as being related to lead or the levels were high, but not high enough to produce clinical signs.In children, acute exposure to very high levels of lead may produce encephalopathy and other accompanying signs of:- ataxia- coma- convulsions- death- hyperirritability- stuporLead serves no useful purpose in the body.The blood lead levels (BLLs) associated with encephalopathy in children vary from study to study, but BLLs of 70-80 ug/dL or greater appear to indicate a serious risk (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 2005). Even without encephalopathy symptoms, these levels are associated with increased incidences of lasting neurological and behavioral damage (ATSDR 2005).Children suffer neurological effects at much lower exposure levels. So even if the levels are lower than where these previous signs may occur, neurological damage may still be occurring or will occur.- Neurological effects may begin at low (and, relatively speaking, more widespread) BLLs, at or below 10 ug/dL in some cases, and it may not be possible to detect them on clinical examination.- Some studies have found, for example, that for every 10 ug/dL increase in BLL, children's IQ was found to be lower by 4 to 7 points (Yule et al, 1981; Schroeder et al, 1985; Fulton et al, 1987; Landsdown et al, 1986; Hawk et al, 1986; Winneke et al, 1990 as cited in AAP 1993).This article does not indicate if the investigators know what the lead source is or if it is being remediated. Is it lead paint in the houses? On the cribs? Portions of this comment were extracted from<https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=7&po=10>. - Mod.TG]
