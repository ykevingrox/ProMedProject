Al-Arabiya [edited]<http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2017/05/17/UNICEF-Yemen-cholera-death-toll-mounts-to-209-.html>A cholera outbreak in Yemen has killed 209 people in recent weeks with 17 200 suspected cases across the war-torn country, the United Nations children's agency said [Wed 17 May 2017]. UNICEF's Yemen mission said that there had been an ""alarming increase"" in cholera-related deaths.The agency's Yemen spokesman Mohammed Al-Asaadi told AFP that 3000 new suspected cholera cases a day were being reported.The International Committee of the Red Cross said [Mon 15 May 2017] that 184 people had died of the disease since 27 April 2017, with 11 000 suspected cases across the country.Cholera is a highly contagious bacterial infection spread through contaminated food or water.UNICEF and the ICRC are part of a joint committee, also including the World Health Organization (WHO) that coordinates with health authorities and relief groups in Sana'a. Authorities in the capital, which is controlled by Houthi militias, this week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] declared a state of emergency over the outbreak, the 2nd wave of cholera cases in less than a year. Hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of patients.A total of 2 years into a devastating war between the Houthis and government forces backed by the Arab military coalition, more than half the country's medical facilities are out of service. Yemen's conflict has killed more than 10 000 people and wounded around 40 000, according to the WHO.The UN has warned that 2-3rds of the population is on the brink of famine.The WHO now classifies Yemen as one of the worst humanitarian emergencies in the world alongside Syria, South Sudan, Nigeria and Iraq.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The total number of cases and deaths continue to dramatically increase. Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen>.The increasing numbers are as follows:Date [2017] / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 209The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press) oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose - or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References1.
