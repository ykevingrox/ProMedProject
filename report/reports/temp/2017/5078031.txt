Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/zoonotic/gi/outbreaks/livepoultry.html>Multistate outbreaks of human salmonella infections linked to live poultry in backyard flocks, 2017------------------------------------------------------------------CDC, many state departments of health and agriculture, and the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service are investigating 8 multistate outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to contact with live poultry in backyard flocks. These outbreaks are caused by several kinds of salmonellae: _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup, _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Hadar, _S._ I 4,[5],12:i-, _S._ Indiana, _S._ Infantis, _S._Mbandaka, and _S._ Typhimurium.As of 25 May 2017, 372 people infected with the outbreak strains of salmonella have been reported from 47 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 4 January 2017 to 13 May 2017. A total of 71 ill people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. 36 per cent of ill people are children younger than 5 years.Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings link the 8 outbreaks to contact with live poultry, such as chicks and ducklings, which come from several hatcheries. In interviews, 190 (83 per cent) of 228 ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before illness started. People reported purchasing live baby poultry from several sources, including feed supply stores, websites, hatcheries, and from relatives.Contact with live poultry and the areas where they live and roam can make people sick with salmonella infections. Chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry that look healthy and clean can still carry salmonella. Outbreaks linked to contact with live poultry have increased in recent years as more people keep backyard flocks. In 2016, a record number of illnesses were linked to contact with backyard poultry.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle, and they carry salmonella. Two ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
