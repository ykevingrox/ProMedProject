For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries is zoonotic and does not generally cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population older than 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html>.) - Mod.LLMaps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2143>. - Mod.LL]
