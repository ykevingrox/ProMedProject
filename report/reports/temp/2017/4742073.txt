Had we have been aware of it sooner it would have been published sooner. - Mod.MPP][In the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, a woman] rests on the bed as an MSF gynaecologist performs an ultrasound of her growing belly. She seems surprised when, unexpectedly, the outline of a baby appears on the monitor, and her expression quickly turns to relief as the translator confirms that the unborn child is progressing well. The woman is one of 44 patients with hepatitis E who have been admitted to Am Timan hospital in Chad since September 2016. More than 320 other potential cases have been identified.The 1st cases of hepatitis E were diagnosed at Am Timan hospital in late August 2016. Like cholera, hepatitis E is transmitted from one person to another, mainly through contaminated drinking water, and rapidly spreads in places where hygiene and sanitary conditions are poor.It is estimated that 1 in 25 patients with hepatitis E is at risk of death, but for pregnant women in their 3rd trimester, the risks of maternal and fetal mortality are higher. Among the 9 patients who have died in the past few months, 3 were pregnant women with jaundice.Veronica Siebenkotten-Branca, an MSF gynaecologist in Am Timan, explains that hepatitis E has no cure and is particularly dangerous for pregnant women. ""Depending on how severe the hepatitis E infection is during pregnancy, it can potentially lead to serious consequences for maternal and fetal health. Abortion, post-partum haemorrhage, and premature or still birth are among the worst situations a mother can face.""Since the 1st cases of hepatitis E were identified, more than 600 MSF staff have been working to test for new cases, treat patients, and improve water supplies and sanitation. Many staff are community health workers whose main role is to talk to people about the early signs and symptoms of hepatitis E and to share information about hygiene practices. Most people in Am Timan had not previously heard of hepatitis E, and as a result, staff are working to address fear and suspicion about the ""sick people with yellow eyes"". This work includes meeting with local chiefs, leaders, and officials, to hear their concerns, identify needs and encourage them to talk to their community about the urgency of responding to hepatitis E. In the last 4 weeks, they have also distributed more than 11 000 hygiene kits containing bars of soap and buckets. In many cases, hepatitis E patients have been seen as a threat to the community, leading to both stigmatisation and shame for those who are diagnosed. But with support from community outreach workers, this is changing.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It appears as though there has been significant ongoing transmission of HEV in Chad during the past year (2016).  In an earlier report carried on Relief Web, an outbreak was reported in Salamat, South-East Chad (the Am Timam hospital is located in the South-East of Chad.) 27 Oct 2016  - ""An outbreak of Hepatitis E has been reported in the region of Salamat, South-East Chad. The outbreak has already resulted in the death of 5 people. MSF has so far identified a total of 179 cases."" (<http://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-hepatitis-e-outbreak-echo-msf-who-echo-daily-flash-27-october-2016>).  The South-East of Chad has been a location for displaced persons from the Sudan conflict for a number of years. - Mod.MPP][This article provides some important potential insight into why there is a substantial increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:Kmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al: The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2016; 94(1): 203-11<http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.15-0238>Abstract--------""Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is severe during pregnancy, with a pregnant case fatality rate around 30 percent. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study.""Of the 4 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation.Maps of Chad can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/chad.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25728>. Am Timan (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am_Timan>) is a city in Chad and is the capital of the region of Salamat. In Arabic, Am Timan means ""mother of twins,"" although the reason for the name is not known. It can be seen on a map this website. - Mod.LL]
