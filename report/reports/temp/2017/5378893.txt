A total of 561 reported cases of plague were recorded, including 415 pulmonary forms, 145 bubonic forms, and another unspecified case. In general, there are 57 deaths with a national case fatality rate of 10.2% (the ratio of deaths to the total number of cases reported). The following figures show the distribution of case numbers by district (above) and region (below) [The numbers for each district and region can be seen at the original URL. - Mod.LL]--Communicated by:Melissa DudleySenior Health Intelligence Analyst<mlsdudley@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Melissa Dudley for this posting.The rapid rise of cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection with a predominance of pneumonic plague (415/561 - 74%) is quite worrisome.

It detects the emergence of strains of reduced susceptibility or resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamides, antimicrobials recommended and used in the National Program, and evaluates other alternatives (tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol) for treatment.Since the beginning of the season, the 11 isolated strains are sensitive to these antimicrobials. They have been isolated from Miarinarivo, Moramanga, Mahajanga, Tsiroanomandidy and Andramasina.--Communicated by:Amanda WalshPublic Health England<amanda.walsh@phe.gov.uk>[ProMED thanks Amanda Walsh for a source to the antimicrobial sensitivity data for strains in the current outbreak, which appear to be fully sensitive. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181>.]
