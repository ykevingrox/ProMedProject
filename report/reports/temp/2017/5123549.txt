WHTC [edited]<http://whtc.com/news/articles/2017/jun/22/un-blames-warring-sides-for-yemens-man-made-cholera-catastrophe/>UN [United Nations] humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien described the cholera outbreak in Yemen, which is fast approaching 300 000 cases, as a ""man-made catastrophe"" caused by the warring sides in the country's civil war and their international backers. The number of suspected cases of the disease, which is caused by ingesting bacteria from water or food contaminated with feces, reached 179 548 by [Tue 20 Jun 2017], with 1205 deaths, according to the WHO.""This is because of conflict, it's man-made, it's very severe, the numbers are absolutely staggering, it's getting worse, and the cholera element in addition to the lack of food, the lack of medical supplies, primarily one has to put that at the door of all the parties to the conflict,"" O'Brien said. ""Be that the parties on the ground or their proxies, they all have to recognize that there is a shared responsibility for causing a man-made humanitarian catastrophe, which is where we are in Yemen at the moment.""A Reuters analysis of WHO data showed the cholera caseload is growing at more than 4 percent a day, while the number of deaths is rising at just over 3.5 percent a day. That marks a slowdown in the spread of the disease compared to the early stages of the 8-week outbreak, but still puts the number of cases on course to reach 300 000 in the 1st week of July 2017, while deaths are expected to rise to 2000. That means the disease is spreading twice as quickly as the WHO feared. The WHO's representative in Yemen said on [Mon 19 May 2017] that the 300 000-mark might come within 6 months.Yemen's cholera epidemic follows an economic collapse and 2 years of civil war which has left 19 million people in need of humanitarian aid. The exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, supported by the US-backed, Saudi-led coalition, is trying to roll back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sana'a.Nigel Timmins, humanitarian director at aid charity Oxfam, which has called for a ""cholera ceasefire"", told a UN meeting on [Wed 21 Jun 2017, that governments were stoking the war rather than prioritizing the humanitarian crisis. ""In Yemen, governments who are providing generous funding are also making money from supplying weapons, munitions, military equipment, technology. They are providing logistical and financial support for the military action taking place,"" he said. ""Diplomatic pressure on the warring parties inside and outside the country has to be made so that we can find solutions, because surely that is a priority over arms sales?""[Byline: Tom Miles]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 53202 Jun / 73 700 / 60504 Jun / 86 400 / 67605 Jun / 91 400 / 72806 Jun / 96 000 / 74607 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 1205To be consistent with past posts, the date is the day prior to the specific posting but, as this one, may not reflect the data point day. In the last 4 weeks, almost 150 000 cases and almost 900 deaths have been reported, and despite the post reporting a slow down, with no clear sign of the numbers slowing down. Referring to the epidemic as ""man-made"" does not imply biowarfare but rather being related to the armed conflict.There is no evidence that the spread of cholera in Yemen is deliberate at this point. Regarding cholera as a biological weapon:""During World War II, the Japanese biological weapons program known as Unit 731 located in Pingfan Manchuria (24 km -approx. 15 mi- south of Harbin) experimented with _Vibrio cholerae_ as a weapons agent. It was reported that the Japanese dropped cholera and typhus cultures into more than 1000 Chinese wells and reportedly caused 10 000 cases in 1941. However, an estimated 1700 of the deaths were Japanese soldiers, a testimony to the difficulty of protecting one's own troops from biological agents and controlling infections. South Africa's biological weapons program, Project Coast (1981-1994), under the direction of Colonel Wouter Basson, developed cholera as a possible biological agent. It was reported that during South Africa's civil war, cholera, anthrax and other bacteria were released into water in rebel-held areas. Iraq's biological weapons program reportedly began with the start of the Al-Hazen Institute in 1974 where cholera was one of the biological agents under study. North Korea reportedly also studied cholera as a possible biological weapons agent."" <http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/bio_cholera.htm> - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
