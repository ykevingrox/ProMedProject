PanamÌÁ AmÌ©rica [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://m.panamaamerica.com.pa/provincias/salud-intensifica-operativos-en-tonosi-por-nuevos-casos-de-hanta-1081893>Health officials are intensifying operations in Tonosi due to new hantavirus cases. The 3 new hantavirus fever cases are registered in Tonosi, which is why health authorities are intensifying operations in this region in Los Santos province.Carlos MuÌ±oz, Regional Epidemiology Coordinator, stated that the cases include a 27-year-old woman and 2 males, each of 17 and 37 years.The woman was treated in the Tonosi Rural Hospital, whereas the other 2 cases were managed in the JoaquÌ n Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas, where the 37-year-old patient was released.These cases [presumably in Los Santos province. - Mod.TY] have increased the total number of hantavirus fever cases to 12 and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome to 4. Of these hantavirus fever statistics, 11 cases are from the Tonosi region.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases of hantavirus infections in Los Santos province continues to climb this year (2017), with most coming from the Tonosi region.There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in these 3 cases or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55286>. - Mod.TY]
