Daily Mail [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4454666/Woman-larvae-burst-skin.html>A woman had maggots burst out of her skin in a scene that would fit right into the popular sci-fi film 'Alien'. Known only by her surname [G], the 28-year-old was backpacking around South America at the end of March [2017] with her friends. While in a Brazilian rainforest, she was bitten by a 'peanut-sized insect' on her right leg. After returning home to Shanghai, she noticed the lump left by the bite had split open and was itching intensely. [G] was horrified when larvae, the 'grub' stage of an insect, burst out from beneath her skin.[G] was most likely bitten by an insect that was carrying the eggs of a human botfly, which is scientifically known as Dermatobia hominis. Initially, the fly left 3 lumps on her leg and itched for several hours. [G] was able to complete her trip, visiting Bolivia and other Amazonian countries without further incident until she returned home.After the sci-fi inspired outburst, [G's] family took her to Longhua Hospital where doctors examined her leg. They found 2 more larvae were lying buried beneath the skin, yet to emerge. These have since been surgically removed. [G] is stable and recovering well with antibiotics.[Byline: Alexandra Thompson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[News reports of tourists arriving home with this fly larva is not all that rare. It happens and newspapers love them. This report has outstanding pictures of the larvae. In Latin America it is a well-known parasite of cattle and other animals, and people and their dogs. I wrote my MPH thesis on the fly having seen it on our expedition traverse of South and Central America. Like all cuterebrid flies it is fascinating.This dipteran fly has a most unusual life cycle. The adult fly inhabits the forests of Mexico, Central America and South America. Unlike many of the obligatory myiasis-producing dipterans (with the exception of Cuterebra species), the female fly does not deposit her eggs directly on the host. Instead, she captures another dipteran fly, usually a bloodsucker, [or catching a mosquito in midair preparing to feed] or a tick and using a quick-drying adhesive, cements the eggs to one side of the carrier's body. The eggs are attached to the carrier in such a manner that when contact is made with the prospective definitive host, the anterior end of the egg is directed downward. An operculum forms on this end of the egg, through which the larva emerges. The larva penetrates the skin of the host to the subcutaneous tissues and produces a warble (swelling) at the point of contact. Dermatobiahominis does not meander through the subcutis. The t√å rsalo matures to its most advanced larval stage in the body of the host (Harwood and James, 1979). Development in the host requires 35 to 70 days. The larva then drops to the ground where it enters the soil for pupation. The entire life cycle takes 90 to 120 days (Harwood and James, 1979). [From AAVP: <http://www.aavp.org/wiki/arthropods/insects/cuteribridae/dermatobia-hominis/>]Larval penetration of the skin is accompanied by pain and local inflammation, and pus gradually forms. Infested hides are condemned at slaughter, and production of milk and meat is reduced. In 1982, it was estimated that cattle infested with D hominis resulted in a yearly reduction in weight of 40.6 g/larva. In 2014, combining losses due to reduced weight gain and hide damage, infestation by D hominis in cattle raised in Brazil was estimated to cost producers USD 383 million annually. Efforts to characterize and produce antigenic proteins that confer immunity against D hominis have resulted in identification of a candidate vaccine, with 90 percent efficacy in immunized cattle.
