Poultry Med ]edited]<http://www.poultrymed.com/Poultrymed/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=178&FID=1908&PID=0&IID=53703>Since the ECDC and EFSA joint rapid outbreak assessment was published on 7 March 2017, 6 EU Member States (Belgium, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the UK) have reported 50 confirmed and 12 probable new cases associated with the multi-country outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis phage type 8 infections (MLVA profiles 2-9-7-3-2 and 2-9-6-3-2) ongoing in the EU/EEA. In addition, 12 probable cases have been reclassified as confirmed.The UK has reported 47 of the 63 outbreak cases since March [2017]. From 1 May 2016 to 26 Jun 2017, 14 EU countries had 280 confirmed and 257 probable cases. The outbreak peaked in the last week of September 2016 when around 60 cases were reported. From 2012 to 31 March 2016, 107 historical confirmed and 24 probable cases were also reported. Croatia recorded the death of a 5 year old child and Hungary also noted a fatal case. Up to 14 countries have been affected: Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK.The outbreak investigation identified eggs from 3 Polish packing centers as the vehicle of infection. Following control measures in Poland in November 2016, new outbreak cases decreased. Fermy Drobiu Wo¼niak (Wozniak Poultry Farms) was named as the supplier of contaminated eggs by several national authorities.Since March 2017, the number of newly reported cases has increased: Up to 63 outbreak cases, 53 confirmed and 10 probable. The isolates from the confirmed cases belonged to both whole genome sequencing clusters associated with the outbreak.Confirmed cases with a travel history to Portugal have only been seen since mid-April 2017. ECDC said it was plausible that Portugal, which had not reported outbreak cases so far, has only recently been affected by the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010>.]
