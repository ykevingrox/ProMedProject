The Assam Tribune [edited]<http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jul1717/city057>State Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today [16 Jul 2017] reported that 131 Japanese encephalitis [JE] acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) related deaths have been reported in the state this year [2017] till Saturday [15 Jul 2017].""Till yesterday [14 Jul 2017], 305 positive cases of JE have been reported, of which 44 have died. Similarly, 1111 AES cases have been reported, of which 87 have died,"" he said.Last year [2016], of the 1713 AES cases, 187 people had died, and of the 427 JE cases, 92 had died.The Health Minister said the government has decided to carry out JE vaccination throughout the year. ""We will increase the number of doses to 2 from this year [2017]. Studies have shown that single doses are not enough. The success rate of single doses is 85 percent,"" he said.Referring to incidents in some places where people were reluctant to take the vaccines due to rumours, Sarma said that of late, people are coming forward. ""We are adopting a soft approach. We have not set any timeframe. Focus has been given on creating more awareness ... and people have started coming forward to take the vaccination,"" he said.He blamed ""so-called"" religious leaders for launching a campaign against the vaccination drive. ""Some political parties are also playing the game,"" he alleged.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case counts above are confusing. The 1st statement indicates that there are 131 confirmed JE and AES-related deaths [etiology undetermined], and the 2nd statement reports that there are 305 positive JE cases with 44 deaths, and 1111 AES cases with 87 deaths.As noted in earlier comments, Assam state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there every year. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in northeastern India, not all cases are due to JE virus and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined.As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus ( _Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.Although avoidance of mosquito bites is prudent, vector control is difficult, so vaccination is the best protective measure. The Health Minister in the above report indicates that JE vaccination will be carried out throughout the year. The virus has birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands.Maps of India can be accessed at: <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>.
