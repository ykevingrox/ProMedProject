In August 2016, the Chicago Department of Public Health was notified of 2 patients with _C. auris_ infections who were treated at the same acute care hospital (ACH) and long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). We investigated possible health care transmission to guide control measures.Cases were defined as _C. auris_ isolated from clinical cultures. We reviewed medical records to identify overlaps in time and location; sampled patients' rooms; and screened patients, ACH ward mates, and LTACH patients for colonization. Isolates were analyzed using whole genome sequencing (WGS)._C. auris_ was isolated from Patient 1's bloodstream in May 2016 and Patient 2's urine in July 2016. These patients had 3 overlapping ACH admissions during March-July 2016, but wards differed. In April 2016, 3 days separated their hospitalizations on the same LTACH ward. In August, we detected _C. auris_ colonization of index patients' skin, nares, vagina, and rectum. _C. auris_ was present on mattress, bed rail, chair, table, and window ledge surfaces in Patient 1's hospital room. 3 (6 percent) of 50 sampled LTACH patients, hospitalized on the same ward as both index patients, exhibited C. auris colonization; no ACH ward mates were colonized. All available patient isolates were highly related (<10 single nucleotide polymorphisms) by WGS.Nearly indistinguishable _C. auris_ strains were isolated from patients exposed to a single Chicago LTACH ward, indicating likely health care-associated transmission. Persistent colonization of patients, health care environment contamination, and ward mate colonization necessitate ongoing patient and environmental surveillance, strict adherence to Standard and Contact Precautions, and thorough environmental decontamination to control spread.[Authors: Kerins JL, Kemble S, Pacilli M, et al]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] New YorkDate: Wed 26 Apr 2017Source: CDC EIS Conference [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/cdc-24-7/eis-conference/pdf/66th_2017_EIS_conf_book_FINAL2_508.pdf>The First Eight Reported Cases of _Candida auris_, an Emerging, Multidrug-Resistant Yeast -- New York, 2013-2016----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, multidrug resistant yeast that has caused hospital-associated outbreaks of invasive infections with high mortality. CDC issued a clinical alert to USA healthcare facilities in June 2016 requesting notification of _C. auris_ cases. As of September 2016, 8 of 12 USA cases reported were from New York, prompting investigation to determine risk factors and assess relatedness of cases to limit transmission.A case was defined as _C. auris_ isolated from any patient specimen at a NY healthcare facility before October 2016. We reviewed clinical records, characterized isolates, examined infection control practices at affected facilities, and swabbed case patients, their rooms, and ward mates.A total of 8 cases occurring during May 2013 - October 2016 were identified at 6 healthcare facilities. Case-patients had multiple indwelling devices, including urinary catheters (75 percent), gastrostomy tubes (63 percent), tracheostomy tubes (63 percent), and central venous catheters (63 percent). All had ä´3 healthcare facility encounters within 90 days of diagnosis; 2 patient pairs had overlapping stays at 2 different facilities. 3 (38 percent) died within 28 days of diagnosis. Most isolates were highly related by whole-genome sequencing and 5 (63 percent) were resistant to 2 antifungal drug classes. Three of 4 patients sampled had _C. auris_ colonization in multiple body sites weeks after 1st positive culture; _C. auris_ was also found in patient rooms and colonizing a ward mate. Inadequate Contact Precaution adherence was found at some involved long-term care facilities.Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence suggest that multidrug-resistant _C. auris_ may have been transmitted within NY healthcare facilities. To curb further spread, adherence to recommended infection control practices, particularly in long-term care facilities, coupled with public health surveillance and rapid response, are urgently needed.[Authors: Tsay S, Poirot E, Chow N, et al]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These abstracts, presented at this week's CDC EIS conference in Atlanta fills in information regarding some of the early cases of _C. auris_ infection in the USA. In a CDC update from March 2017 (Candida auris - USA Archive Number: 20170312.4895788), the largest number of infections has been reported in New York, with at least 28 cases. Infections have also been reported in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. It is not clear how genetically related the isolates from different areas are._C. auris_ phenotypically resembles _Candida haemulonii_. Commercially available biochemical-based tests, including API strips and VITEK-2, used in many US laboratories to identify fungi, cannot differentiate _C. auris_ from related species. Because of these challenges, clinical laboratories have misidentified the organism as _C. haemulonii_ or _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. Many clinical laboratories do not fully identify all candida to the species level, and _C. auris_ isolates have been reported as ""other _Candida_ spp and many do not perform antifungal sensitivities on the isolates. Isolates of _C. auris_ have been sensitive to the echinocandin type of antifungals which are only available for intravenous administration, not orally. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/216>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.]
