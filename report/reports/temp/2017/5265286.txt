Sudan Tribune [edited]<http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article63300>An outbreak of malaria in South Sudan has killed over 4000 people since February [2017], a senior health official disclosed last week [week of Sun 13 Aug 2017]. ""This year's malaria is the most severe the country has ever seen,"" Dr Isaac Mapeer, the deputy head of the Malaria Control Program at South Sudan's Ministry of Health, told Anadolu Agency on [Thu 17 Aug 2017]. A total of over 900 000 malaria cases had so far been registered, according to Mapeer. ""Up to 4073 deaths were recorded since February [2017], while 2000 deaths were reported in 2016"", he stressed.Malaria is a life-threatening mosquitoborne blood disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of the anopheles mosquito. Once an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasites multiply in the host's liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells.According to the senior health official, the country's Epidemic Task Force, headed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other partners has also stepped up efforts to fight the disease.The health official, however, decried the lack of funds to fight malaria and appealed for donations to help fight the disease. In July [2017], OCHA said more than 76 per cent of disease-related deaths in South Sudan are from malaria.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the WHO 2016 World Malaria Report (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/252038/1/9789241511711-eng.pdf?ua=1>), malaria control in South Sudan was entirely dependent on foreign aid donations and the report stated that 60 per cent of the population sleeps under an impregnated bed net.However, the civil war in the country probably means that malaria control activities and probably drug distribution have been impaired, which could be one explanation for the reported outbreak. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402>.]
