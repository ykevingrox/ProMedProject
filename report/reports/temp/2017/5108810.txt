Authorities recommend preventing diseases with vaccination.The Ministry of Health has insisted that preventive measures be taken to prevent acute respiratory infection (ARI) for public health in the country.To date, the National Health Institute has reported 195 deaths per acute respiratory infection in children under 5 years of age. The places where they have presented are Cundinamarca, Valle del Cauca and Bogota, Putumayo, NariÌ±o, Norte de Santander, La Guajira, CÌ rdoba, Magdalena, GuainÌ a, BolÌ var and Cauca.According to the report up to [Sat 3 Jun 2017], national mortality is 4.5 per 100 000 children under 5 years of age. However, in GuainÌ a, ChocÌ  and VaupÌ©s have the highest mortality in children under 5 with 75.5, 23.0 and 16.6 respectively [per 100 000].That's not all. To date, more than 3.1 million outpatient and emergency room records have been reported for this disease.As the Minsalud studies have shown, the influenza vaccine is recommended to be given the 1st semester of each year. As the individual is thus covered during the 2 epidemiological peaks usually evidenced in the country are 1st from April to July, and the 2nd from September to November.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED welcomes any information readers may have on the etiology of this acute respiratory disease. The report suggests influenza since the health ministry is recommending influenza vaccination, but a number of viruses cause acute respiratory disease. A publication from 2007 found influenza A (H3N2) was the most frequently isolated agent from an outbreak in 2003 in Colombia:Herrera D1, de la Hoz F, Velandia M. Severe respiratory disease and its relationship with respiratory viruses in Colombia. Int J Infect Dis. 2008 Mar;12(2):139-42. Epub 2007 Aug 27.Background: There are important gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections in tropical countries. In September 2003, the Colombian epidemiological surveillance system was notified of several deaths from an acute respiratory disease (ARD).Methods: In order to identify the agents associated with ARD cases, a clinical and laboratory-based surveillance system was implemented throughout the country.Results: Between September 19 and December 31, 2003, 64 suspected cases of ARD were reported; of these reported cases, 21 (33 percent) died. Among 25 patients who underwent virus studies, influenza A (H3N2) (n=7) was the most frequently identified agent. Other viruses included parainfluenza (4), influenza B (1), and respiratory syncytial virus (3). The peak occurrence of cases and deaths coincided with the replacement of the influenza A (H3N2) Panama strain, which had been circulating in Colombia since 1999, by 3 new influenza A (H3N2) strains (Korea, Fujian, and Wyoming).Laboratory assays are needed to determine the agent in this current outbreak, and likely are underway.A Healthmap/ProMED map of Colombia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16>. - Mod.LK].................................................sb/lk/ec/dk"
