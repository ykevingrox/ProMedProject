MENAFN, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]<http://menafn.com/1095901088/Nearly-850000-get-cholera-vaccine-in-Nigeria-WHO>The WHO said Tue 26 Sep 2017, it has completed a massive cholera vaccination campaign in restive northeastern Nigeria, where the disease has already killed 54 people. The week-long campaign allowed 844 000 people to receive one dose of the vaccine, which offers protection against the deadly disease for 6 months, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva. Northeastern Nigeria is in the grip of a humanitarian crisis caused by the Boko Haram insurgency, which has killed at least 20 000 people and displaced more than 2.6 million. As of Mon 25 Sep 2017, nearly 4000 suspected cases of cholera had been detected in the region in just over a month, according to WHO numbers.Cholera is transmitted through contaminated drinking water and causes acute diarrhoea, with children facing a particularly high risk of infection. With 54 related deaths so far, the case fatality rate, which measures the severity of an epidemic by defining the proportion of fatal cases within a specific timeframe, is currently at 1.4 percent -- well above the emergency threshold of one percent. The 1st cholera case was identified in Borno State on 16 Aug 2017 and has since spread, mainly in camps for those displaced by the Boko Haram insurgency.2 doses of the vaccine are needed to offer full protection, but in emergency situations, the WHO allows for a single dose to be given to speed up the coverage. Waterborne diseases are a constant threat because of a lack of adequate sanitation as well as stagnant groundwater during the current rainy season. In addition to the vaccination campaign, WHO and other aid organisations are helping the Nigerian government to respond to the outbreak by establishing cholera treatment centres, ""increasing outreach to communities with information on cholera and on prevention"", Jasarevic said. Providing access to safe water was also a priority, he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Nigeria can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/621>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Diarrhea - Bangladesh: Rohingya refugee campsDate: Mon 2 Oct 2017Source: Financial Tribune [edited]<https://goo.gl/BA456w>Rohingya camps facing full-scale health disaster------------------------------------------------The UN has warned of a humanitarian ""nightmare"" unfolding in Bangladesh's refugee camps, where half a million people have taken shelter after fleeing violence in Myanmar in unprecedented waves. With a lack of clean water and toilets, aid workers say a major health disaster is imminent, AFP [Agence France-Presse] reported. Heavy monsoon rain is compounding the risk of disease outbreak, with field doctors reporting a huge spike in cases of severe diarrhea, especially among children. The near daily torrential downpours send streams rushing through areas where tens of thousands openly defecate every day. For some, this murky runoff is their only source of drinking water.A stench of excreta hangs in the air on the outskirts of Kutupalong, a camp that already housed tens of thousands of refugees before the latest influx saw it mushroom into a fetid tent city stretching for miles. At a field clinic, a long queue of refugees waiting to see the only doctor available stretched beyond the tent into the pouring rain. Dr Alamul Haque sees upwards of 400 patients a day and looked exhausted as he described the spiraling number of children presenting with water-borne illnesses.""Earlier parents were bringing 1 or 2 children with them. Now it's 3 to 4,"" Dr Haque, from Bangladeshi charity SDI, told AFP. ""It's been raining, so human waste is running everywhere. There is a high chance of a diarrhea epidemic here.""The Red Cross says camps are teetering on the precipice of a full-scale health disaster. Conditions are ripe for an illness like cholera to tear through the densely populated camps, experts say, where refugees live cheek by jowl. ""The risk of there being an acute, watery diarrhea epidemic is real and serious,"" said an international health and sanitation expert, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Bangladesh can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Bangladesh.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] Diarrhea - Philippines: (Palawan province)Date: Sun 1 Oct 2017 4:23 PM PHTSource: Manila Bulletin [edited]<http://news.mb.com.ph/2017/10/01/diarrhea-cases-still-being-monitored-in-palawan/>The cases of diarrhea in Quezon, Palawan are still being monitored by the Department of Health (DOH) in MIMAROPA (Oriental/Occidental Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan). After ordering the immediate delivery of medicines and medical supplies to the affected area to prevent the further increase of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) or diarrhea in selected barangays, DOH regional director Eduardo C Janairo noted that they are still doing active surveillance despite the recorded decrease in the number of cases.""Although the cases are now declining, we are still continuing disease surveillance and directly in coordination with the local and provincial health offices in case diarrhea cases in the affected barangays [smallest administrative division in the Philippines] will again rise,"" Janairo said. ""The best thing to do right now is for the residents to seek medical checkup once they experience abdominal pain, dehydration and having watery stool so that they can be given the immediate medical response needed,"" he added.As of 18 Sep 2017, the Quezon Rural Health Unit [RHU] reported a total of 644 AGE cases. There are 358 cases admitted at Quezon Medicare Hospital (QMH); 233 cases at the Quezon Municipal Health Office (MHO); and 53 cases at Luke Society Clinic.Based on the merged data from Quezon RHU and Palawan Provincial Epidemiological Surveillance Unit (PESU) from 4 Jul 2017 to 18 Sep 2017, the most affected barangays are Alfonso XII and Pinaglabanan. The diarrhea cases are 79 percent higher compared to the ""historical average"" recorded for the last 4 years, which is on an average of 359 cases from 2013 to 2016. Half of diarrhea cases reported were from 18 years old and below age group, affecting mostly the 1- to 10-year-old children. The majority of the cases were female.According to the result of the water source assessment conducted in the municipality of Quezon by the Palawan Epidemiology, Surveillance, and Statistics Unit (PESSU), most of the water sources, systems, and refilling stations do not comply with the necessary health and sanitation requirements. _E. coli_ and amoebae are also present in some of the water sources.AGE or diarrhea is characterized by loose, watery stools. It can be acute which lasts for 2 to 3 days; or chronic which is the result of a viral or bacterial infection and can last for weeks. ""Proper hygiene is the best prevention against diarrhea. Clean drinking water is also important. Frequent hand washing with soap and water prevents the spread of infection. Use hand sanitizer if possible,"" Janairo reminded.[Byline: Charina Clarisse Echaluce]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of the Philippines can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/z4y3p5v> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63167>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThe mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
