Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/norovirus-california-state-officials-work-local-control-outbreak-23291/>California state health officials said they are working with local public health departments across the state to help control norovirus outbreaks that have increased in the past few weeks, and are occurring in schools and other institutional settings.""Norovirus outbreaks usually have an annual peak like we are seeing now. They can be particularly large and disruptive in schools, affecting both students and teachers,"" said CDPH [California Department of Public Health] Director and State Public Health Officer Dr Karen Smith. ""Norovirus is very infectious and can spread rapidly wherever people congregate and share food and bathroom facilities. Fortunately, most people with norovirus infection will recover quickly, usually in 1-3 days.""In Yolo County, which has been hit very hard by norovirus, announced the Woodland Joint Unified School District (WJUSD), has decided to close Dingle and Tafoya elementary schools on Fri 26 May 2017, to limit further transmission of the norovirus in these 2 schools, which have experienced particularly high rates of the illness.Current reported numbers of affected students and school staff in Yolo County since 1 May 2017 is 3374.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are between 19-21 million cases of norovirus illness each year in the US. Additionally, CDC estimates that norovirus contributes to 56 000-71 000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths each year in the US.The spread of norovirus can be prevented by practicing proper hand hygiene. Important strategies include washing hands with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and changing diapers, and always before eating and preparing or handling food.Symptoms of norovirus [infection] include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. Symptoms last for 1-3 days. However, after symptoms go away, people are still highly infectious, especially the 1st 48 hours. There is no treatment for norovirus illness. The most important steps to prevent the spread of norovirus is to stay home if you are sick, and for another 48 hours after symptoms go away, and to regularly wash hands.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3958>.

A new variant, Sydney 2012, became the dominant strain in England and Wales. Because people were less immune to this new strain, it spread quickly. More than a million people are thought to have had norovirus during that outbreak, 63 percent higher than the same time the prior year. Perhaps a change in viral strain is also the reason the outbreak in California is so large this year.In the US, between September 2013 and August 2016, 2715 genotyped norovirus outbreaks were submitted to CaliciNet. GII.4 Sydney viruses caused 58 percent of outbreaks during these years. Acquisition of alternative RNA polymerases by recombination is an important mechanism for norovirus evolution and a phenomenon that was shown to occur more frequently than previously recognized in the US. The authors concluded that continued molecular surveillance of norovirus strains, including typing of both polymerase and capsid genes, is important for monitoring emerging strains in continued efforts to reduce the overall burden of norovirus disease (excerpted from Cannon JL et al: Genetic and epidemiologic trends of norovirus outbreaks in the US demonstrated emergence of novel GII.4 recombinant viruses, 2013-2016.
