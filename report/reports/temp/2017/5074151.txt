Manila Bulletin [edited] <http://news.mb.com.ph/2017/05/28/food-poisoning-downs-910-prisoners-at-nbp/>A total of 910 prisoners at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City have fallen ill due to apparent food poisoning since Fri 26 May 2017. Director general Benjamin Delos Santos of the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) told The Manila Bulletin that the ""proximate cause is food served by caterer [Thu 25 May 2017] evening."" However, investigators are also testing the facility's water source.""(We) will do lab tests on food and water tomorrow [Mon 29 May 2017],"" said Delos Santos. Quoting the NBP report, he said 69 prisoners have been confined at the NBP Hospital and that one of them - an elderly inmate - was in critical condition. ""He is an elderly inmate from the minimum-security compound and has been ill before,"" he noted.At least 600 other prisoners were diagnosed with diarrhea and were attended to by doctors at the NBP Hospital emergency room since [Fri 26 May 2017]. Delos Santos said a total of 910 prisoners were affected including those who showed symptoms of diarrhea but could just be treated at their own dormitories in the Minimum Security, Medium Security and Maximum Security compounds. NBP Hospital doctors were reportedly orienting leaders of prison blocks on the proper response to treat diarrhea.Relatives of some of the inmates who rushed to the NBP to bring water and food said they spotted 2 water tankers enter the facility to ration water. The NBP has more than 22 000 inmates.[byline: Jonathan M Hicap]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Tue 30 May 2017Source: UNTV News [edited]<https://www.untvweb.com/news/inmates-positive-of-food-poisoning-reach-more-than-a-thousand/>Justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II personally visited the New Bilibid Prison on [Mon 29 May 2017], to check on the condition of inmates affected by food poisoning. Aguirre confirmed that since [Fri 26 May 2017], the incident has already affected thousands of inmates who suffered severe stomach pains and diarrhea.Personnel from the Department of Health (DOH) have also arrived in the penitentiary to examine the portions of milkfish said to have poisoned the inmates, mostly from the Maximum-Security Compound. Aside from the milkfish, the DOH also examined the water supply in the facility which could have caused diarrhea. For now, Aguirre is awaiting the result of the test.Meanwhile, around 150 inmates are still under observation inside the NBP Hospital. One of them is currently in a critical condition. Aguirre said they have sent bananas and clean drinking water to help treat the inmates' diarrhea.[byline: Leslie Longboen]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The etiology of this large prison-associated foodborne illness is unclear. A variety of microorganisms could be associated with this diarrheal illness including salmonella, campylobacter and vibrio. ProMED-mail awaits additional information.With the possible food source being milkfish, it is tempting to implicate an aquatic microorganism such as a _Vibrio_ species such as _V. parahaemolyticus_ but even if the fish is the source, it could have been contaminated after harvesting. The milkfish (_Chanos chanos_) is the sole living species in the family _Chanidae_ (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkfish>). The species has many common names. The Hawaiian name for the fish is awa. It is called bangÌ¼s in the Philippines, where it is the national fish. In the Nauruan language, it is referred to as ibiya. Milkfish is also called ""bandeng"" or ""bolu"" in Indonesia. A picture of the fish can be found at the above URL. Of note, milkfish has been linked to scombroid fish poisoning (Lee Y-C, Kung H-F, Chien-Hui Wu C-H, et al. Determination of histamine in milkfish stick implicated in food-borne poisoning. J Food Drug Anal 2016;24: 63-71) caused by histamine formation in inadequately refrigerated fish but the illness does not seem to be histamine-related based on symptoms and timing. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52574>]
