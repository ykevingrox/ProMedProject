Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/zimbabwe-suspect-typhoid-cases-top-2000-vending-ban-issued-32466/>In the past 2-plus months [since late October 2016], Zimbabwe has seen an outbreak of typhoid fever that has resulted in more than 2200 suspected cases and at least 9 deaths, according to local media. According to Health and Child Care minister David Parirenyatwa, 3 out of every 4 cases have been reported in the capital city of Harare. Officials say that so far, 126 cases of typhoid have been confirmed in Harare since the start of the rainy season in Zimbabwe about 2 months ago.The latest outbreak is blamed on water shortages and poor hygiene; however, a New Zimbabwe news report [<http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-34059-Typhoid+Govt+bans+fruits,+veg+vendors/news.aspx>] notes that government officials have issued a street vending ban. However, this has drawn the ire of the Zimbabwe Informal Sectors Organization (ZISO) that said the government must focus on providing clean water and sanitation instead of banning vending.Typhoid still kills more than 220 000 people worldwide each year. It can be treated with antimicrobials.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly [both liver and spleen enlarged]. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (""rose spots"") are about 2 cm in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46291>.]
