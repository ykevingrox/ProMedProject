KTIC Nebraska Rural Radio News [edited]<http://kticradio.com/regional-news/west-nile-virus-positive-horse-swnphd-health-district/>The 1st positive West Nile virus (WNV) horse has been reported in the Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department (SWNPHD) 9 county health district for 2017.""Horses cannot transmit West Nile virus to other horses, animals, or to humans. However, they can get the virus from a mosquito bite."" states Melissa Propp, RN, Surveillance Nurse at SWNPHD. ""WNV causes encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain.""Per the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, the signs of West Nile encephalitis in horses include loss of appetite, depression, fever, quivering muscles, and weakness of limbs. Infected horses may or may not show clinical signs.While there is no specific treatment for horses with WNV, the Department of Agriculture has these recommendations for prevention.- house horses indoors during peak periods of mosquito activity (dusk and dawn);- avoid turning on lights inside the stable during the evening and overnight;- place incandescent bulbs around the perimeter of the stable to attract mosquitoes away from the horses;- remove all birds, including chickens that are in, or close to, the stable;- topical preparations containing mosquito repellants are available for horses. Read the product label before using and follow all instructions;- fogging of stable premises can be done in the evening to reduce mosquitoes; read directions carefully before using.Vaccination is the best practice in prevention of WNV in horses. Owners should contact their veterinarian for additional information.More information on West Nile Virus may be found at SWNPHD website at <http://www.swhealth.ne.gov>.

Mosquitoes become infected with the disease by feeding on infected birds and their bite can infect humans, horse, and other animals.On 2 Aug 2017, a dead crow in the Lake Mills area tested positive for West Nile virus.Jefferson county Health Department director Gail Scott said, typically, infected birds precede any human cases in an area, but it is not inevitable that human or other animal infections will follow.Now, the positive West Nile-related diagnosis of a horse confirms that there are infected mosquitoes in the area that can transmit the virus to people and animals.There have been 20 horses diagnosed in the state so far in 2017.Scott suggested because West Nile virus is known to be circulating, Jefferson county residents and visitors should be vigilant in taking measures to prevent mosquito bites.""It is important people contact their healthcare provider if they suspect they have West Nile virus,"" she said.Also, horse owners should be reminded to contact their veterinarian to vaccinate their animals.In addition to vaccination, horse owners can protect their animals by removing standing water and keeping horses inside from dusk to dawn.""The best way to avoid mosquito-borne diseases is to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate mosquito breeding sites,"" Scott said. ""When cold weather arrives, the mosquitoes will be eliminated, but until then, people are urged to take measures to protect themselves.""The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has monitored the spread of West Nile virus since 2001 among wild birds, horses, mosquitoes, and people. During 2002, the state documented its first human infections and 52 cases were reported that year.During 2016, 13 cases of West Nile virus infection were reported among Wisconsin residents. Jefferson county had cases of the disease involving a bird, 1 horse, and 1 human that year.There were no reports of West Nile virus in 2014. One bird in the county was reported in 2015 and 2 birds and a horse were reported in 2016.Scott noted mild cases would not be reported if the person was not tested.""We are most worried about the serious cases, which, thankfully, are rare,"" she said.West Nile virus infections in humans have been reported from June through October; however, most reported becoming ill with West Nile virus in August and September.No Jefferson county residents have been reported ill in the past 2 years. Scott noted the virus is not transmitted person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans.The majority of people, 80 percent, who are infected with West Nile virus do not get sick.Scott said those who do become ill usually experience mild symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, and fatigue. Fewer than 1 percent of people infected with the virus get seriously ill with symptoms including high fever, muscle weakness, stiff neck, disorientation, mental confusion, tremors, confusion, paralysis, and coma. Older adults and those with compromised immune systems are at a greater risk of central nervous system illness that can be fatal.The Health Department recommends the following:- limit time spent outside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active;- apply insect repellant to clothing, as well as exposed skin since mosquitoes might bite through clothing;- make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry;- properly dispose of items that hold water, such as tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or discarded tires;- clean roof gutters and downspouts for proper drainage;- turn over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats, and canoes when not in use;- change the water in birdbaths and pet dishes at least every 3 days;- clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers.- trim tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours.- landscape to prevent water from pooling in low-lying areas;To report a sick or dead crow, bluejay or raven, call the Dead Bird Reporting Hotline at 1-800-433-1610.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12828>.
