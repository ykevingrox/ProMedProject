APA (Agence de Presse Africaine) News [in French, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://apanews.net/index.php/fr/news/apparition-dun-cas-de-fievre-hemorragique-en-mauritanie>A case of confirmed haemorrhagic fever has been detected in Mauritania, medical sources said [Thu 24 Aug 2017] in Nouakchott.A male patient is currently hospitalized at Hamed Ben Khalifa hospital in Boutilimit [Trarza region], 160 km [99 mi] southeast of Nouakchott, the same sources added, without specifying what type of haemorrhagic fever.The patient was evacuated [Tue 22 Aug 2017] from an area located 140 km [87 mi] south of Boutilimit and some 30 km [19 mi] north of the town of BoghÌ© [Brakna region] on the Senegal River.After suspecting the illness, the attending medical staff sent a sample of the patient's blood to Nouakchott for further analysis and eventually confirmed the existence of the virus [which virus? - Mod.TY]The Mauritanian Ministry of Health immediately dispatched a mission to Boutilimit, which carried out investigations to verify that no other person had been reached [by the virus] in the area from which the patient came.The investigations also seek to ensure that there was no contamination [infection] among the persons who had been in contact with the patient before the diagnosis of his case.This wintering period in Mauritania is generally conducive to the appearance of several types of diseases, including haemorrhagic fevers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Unfortunately, the virus responsible for this case is not stated in the report above. Several viruses are possible, including Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, Lassa fever, and the Ebola-related viruses. Apparently, no other individuals have been affected in the area from which the patient came. The current clinical status of the patient is not stated. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about the symptoms that the patient is presenting and the identification of the virus involved.There is a 3 Jun 2017 reported case of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection in Mauritania. That case appears to have occurred 2 months prior to the case reported above, but it raises the possibility that RVFV is responsible for this latest case (see Rift Valley fever - Mauritania: RFI 20170605.5085590).Maps of Mauritania can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/mauritania/maps/map-of-mauritania.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11620>. - Mod.TY]
