The area people had alleged that the entire focus of health department was on the anti-polio campaign while no measure was being taken to prevent other diseases. Poor quality and ailing routine vaccination program were the factors in the surge of measles cases. They fear that more children will suffer in the affected area, if the vaccination campaign was not launched immediately.The measles is a respiratory infection caused by a virus that can spread via contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person. Sneezing and coughing can release contaminated droplets into the air, adding children who suffer from measles may experience complications including pneumonia, blindness, deafness, ear infection, diarrhea and dehydration.
