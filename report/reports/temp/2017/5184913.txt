South China Morning Post [edited]<http://m.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/2102991/hong-kong-private-hospitals-asked-help-public>Private hospitals will be asked to take patients from public medical wards that are struggling to cope with occupancy rates of up to 124 per cent amid the peak summer flu season. The Hospital Authority said doctors from the Department of Health engaged in [administration] or research would also be invited to provide treatment at public hospitals, where patients are having to wait up to 8 hours to see a doctor and temporary beds are laid out in corridors. These were among a series of measures announced by the authority on [Mon 17 Jul 2017] with the peak flu season expected to last 3 more months.Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei is under the most pressure, with patients who had undergone emergency treatment having to wait for up to 24 hours before being moved into beds on medical wards. The announcement came a day after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor made a surprise visit to the overwhelmed hospital and asked the authority to do something about the shortage of manpower and beds. ""This summer [2017], the flu came earlier and is more severe than previous years,"" Dr Wong Ka-hing, controller of the Centre for Health Protection, said on [Mon 17 Jul 2017]. ""Currently we don't know whether the flu season has reached its peak. We believe the summer influenza will last for a period of time and do not rule out it taking 2 to 3 months to go down to a lower figure.""Chief Executive Carrie Lam (centre) visits Queen Elizabeth Hospital on [Sun 16 Jul 2017]. Wong said the most common flu strain was the H3 virus, which is more usually more deadly, as indicated by the 157 deaths reported as of last week [week of 10 Jul 2017]. The strain is typically more resilient to vaccines than other strains that have circulated in recent years.Dr Cheung Wai-lun, director (cluster service) of the authority, said it would invite doctors from the department who are not currently engaged as medical practitioners to see patients at public hospitals during non-office hours.The authority said it would continue to hire full-time and part-time doctors and nurses to solve the manpower crisis. It would also discuss with the Social and Welfare Department ways to facilitate the discharge of elderly patients to free beds for those in need.Chueng refused to elaborate on plans for private hospitals to provide beds. ""We are still in a discussion stage,"" he said. One private hospital said it would like to help but was already struggling with a 30 per cent surge in demand because of the flu.""We would really want to help the public hospitals if we have extra beds,"" said Dr Clara Wu Wing-yee, associate chief hospital manager of Union Hospital in Sha Tin. ""Summer is usually the off-season which allows doctors to take some leave and rest, but this is not the case this year [2017] as the flu activity is quite unusual.""The Union, which has 331 medical beds, also has a full house on its paediatrics ward. Wu said other beds were at a 90 per cent utilisation rate, which was unusually high, and not all of them were suitable for flu patients.Private Hospital Association chairman Dr Anthony Lee Kai-yiu believed that private hospitals were willing to help but the logistics of transporting patients could be a problem.""By the time the terms have been finalised, the crisis may be over,"" Lee said, adding there had been no official contact with the authority yet. Dr Chan Tsz-tai, vice-chairman of the Frontline Doctors' Union, believed engaging private hospitals was more feasible than getting civil service doctors to help out.""While [the health department doctors] have the medical knowledge, they might not be so familiar with the new way of doing things -- it is like teaching new doctors,"" he said.[Byline: Emily Tsang, Peace Chiu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It seems that influenza A/H3N2 is responsible for the unusual surge in cases in Hong Kong, with increased hospitalization rates. - Mod.UBAMaps of Hong Kong an be seen at <http://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/hongkong/hongkong-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] India (Maharashtra): H1N1Date: Mon 17 Jul 2017 09:12 ISTSource: Hindustan Times [edited]<http://www.hindustantimes.com/health/swine-flu-on-the-rise-among-india-s-young-kills-600-in-first-half-of-2017/story-4pEsOMuTROd1ikdL6hwFDI.html>Studies point towards a new strain of H1N1 [influenza] virus: the Michigan strain, which has been in circulation since the end of 2016 and has replaced the earlier California strain. Till [9 Jul 2017], H1N1 affected 12460 people and caused 600 deaths.The 1st half of 2017 has seen a spurt in the number of deaths and infections caused by influenza A(H1N1), popularly referred to as swine flu in India. Till [9 Jul 2017], H1N1 affected 12 460 people and caused 600 deaths as against 1786 infections and 265 deaths in the whole of last year [2016].Experts are also alarmed that the number is high among young adults. About 40 percent of the deaths and 50 percent of the infections are among people in the 20-50 years age group, with no co-morbid conditions.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, Maharashtra, said this could be because young people move a lot, and are therefore vulnerable to swine flu [influenza A/H1N1pdm09], which is an air-borne infection. His state has topped the list in the country with 2324 cases and 284 deaths so far.Authorities blamed it on indiscriminate testing, even when unnecessary by private laboratories.""Flu outbreaks offer people a herd immunity that lasts for a year or 2. Since Maharashtra had fewer cases in 2016, there is a higher number this year [2017],"" Dr Awate said.What is encouraging, according to experts, is that the situation no longer demands isolating H1N1-positive people as was done to contain the spread in 2009, when the virus was new to India and affected close to 50 000 people and killed more than 2700.Antigenic shift---------------The National Institute of Virology, [NIV] Pune, ruled out mutation theory and some experts believe that the jump in numbers could be attributed to 2 factors: antigenic drift and the spread of a different strain (sub-type of virus) of H1N1 virus.According to the US Centres of Disease Control, ""antigenic drift are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that are closely related to one another... and an immune system exposed to a similar virus will usually recognise it and respond. But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different.... When this happens, the body's immune system may not recognise those viruses.""Dr Chand Wattal, honorary consultant in clinical microbiology at New Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, however, said antigenic drift was not a major issue. ""If the virus mutates, then we consider it a problem."" The Michigan strain-------------------On the other hand, the studies point towards a new strain of H1N1 virus: the Michigan strain, which has been in circulation since the end of 2016 and has replaced the earlier California strain.NIV says it is not more virulent than the California strain. ""Before the H1N1 came to India in 2009, H3N2 was the dominant flu strain since 1919. Now it is H1N1, and till everyone has immunity, waxing and waning of cases and deaths will happen,"" said a researcher from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).""Also, if we compare deaths reported due to communicable diseases such as TB [tuberculosis] or diarrhoea, the [influenza A(H1N1)]-related deaths are much lower,"" he said. The World Health Organisation has also recommended a vaccine for the new strain, named as A/Michigan/45/2015 to replace A/California/7/2009.Testing for flu---------------The government's guidelines do not recommend anyone with fever to be randomly tested, and divides cases in 3 categories -- a, b and, c, wherein category 'a' is of people who experience mild symptoms, category 'b' is people with moderate symptoms, and 'c' are those with severe symptoms. They recommended use of medicines in category 'b' and 'c' patients, as those with mild symptoms are capable of recovering at home with symptomatic treatment, and treatment if symptoms are serious and the person has difficulty breathing.Vaccines and medicines----------------------On the new vaccine recommended by WHO, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the Indian Council of Medical Research said it was needed as the current one ""may be ineffective"".Though no vaccine provides 100 percent protection, it is advisable to take a shot if one is at high risk, especially if suffering from diabetes, hypertension, on immunosuppressants, cancer treatment, etc.The Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) recently eased norms for the sale of anti-viral medicine Oseltamivir and Zanamivir, which are used to treat influenza A/H1N1pdm09.The sale so far was restricted to only a handful of chemists until now, but the new notification allows more pharmacies to sell the medicine. However, a signed and stamped prescription from a registered medical practitioner is still needed to buy the medicine over the counter.[Byline: Rhythma Kaul]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/310>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ[For the 2016-17 influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended changing only the 2009 H1N1 component with A/Michigan/45/2015, which replaces the longstanding A/California/7/2009 and is recommended to improve protection against 2 subclades that have emerged over the past season. The WHO group also noted that an analysis of 2009 H1N1 samples collected from February to August 2016 had shown that the vast majority fell into clade 6B, with most belonging to subclade 6B.1 and a small proportion, mostly from China, belonging to subclade 6B.2.Routine testing based on ferret sera suggested that recently circulating 2009 H1N1 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable from the longstanding vaccine virus strain. Tests using human sera from vaccinated people of different age-groups, however, found a potential gap in protection among adult samples, with potentially an even more significant protection drop for children's samples (<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/09/who-switches-h1n1-southern-hemisphere-flu-vaccine>).However, the seasonal flu vaccines for the northern hemisphere for the 2016-17 season contained the A/California/7/2009 vaccine strain. On 2 Mar 2017, the WHO flu vaccine advisory group issued the recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza season. It announced that the Michigan strain would replace the California strain in the northern hemisphere as well (<http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2017_18_north/en/>) and would become available later this year (2017). -Mod.UBA]
