The death toll has increased by 53 and suspected cases by nearly 35 162 in just 5 days after a 9 Jul 2017 report by WHO, where it put the death toll at 1706 and suspected cases at 297 438.Since 27 Apr 2017, the cholera cases in Yemen have been ""increasing at an average of 5000 a day,"" said WHO in its last week report. ""We are now facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world."" On Tuesday, 11 Jul 2017, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick said in a press conference that the cholera outbreak is ""entirely man-made as a result of the conflict."" He noted that the UN's response failed to keep pace with the cholera spread mainly because it ""did not have enough resources to expand their operations into areas, where health workers were working without pay.""""Unless the international community contributes USD 200 million to address the cholera outbreak in Yemen, the UN aid agencies will be forced to reprogram more resources tagged for malnutrition in the country,"" McGoldrick said.Meanwhile, WHO said it's considering shelving the shipment of cholera vaccines to Yemen. ""A vaccination way ahead of an outbreak would be useful, but that would imply a huge amount of vaccines, taking into account all the countries where cholera was endemic,"" WHO Spokesman Christian Lindmeier was quoted as saying.Fewer than 45 percent of the country's hospitals are operational, but even the operational ones are coping with huge challenges, especially the lack of medications, medical equipment and staff. The blockade on Yemen, as part of a Saudi-led bombing campaign launched in March 2015, has deepened the crisis in the country, which used to import most of its basic needs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the dreadfully impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 1759In the last complete year of data (2015), WHO (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf?ua=1>) reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
