Radio Praha [edited]<http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/two-cases-of-cholera-in-czech-republic>The [Czech Republic's] chief hygiene officer, Eva Gottvaldova, has moved to dispel fears regarding the possible spread of cholera, which was confirmed in the Czech Republic on [Wed 24 May 2017]. 2 Czechs recently back from Tanzania were reportedly hospitalized with the disease on their return. They have now been released and are in quarantine. The last case of cholera in the Czech Republic was 15 years ago and was also contracted abroad. People traveling to high-risk areas are recommended to get a vaccine, which is available in the Czech Republic.[Byline: Daniela LazarovÌÁ]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[When waterborne infections are imported into more developed countries with adequate sanitary conditions and clean water, the risk of secondary cases is minimal.Part of the future prevention of cholera in the developing world is cholera vaccine. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera, in chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).References----------57. Luquero FJ, Grout L, Ciglenecki I, et al.
