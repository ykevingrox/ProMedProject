""A total of 664 suspected and confirmed cases were reported on 23 May 2017. On the same date, 30 deaths related to the disease were recorded,"" reported the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Niamey, on its website.A previous report dated 19 Apr 2017 reported 25 deaths and 86 reported cases. Women account for 60 per cent of the patients of this contagious disease which affects the age group of more than 15 years.The authorities, the World Health Organization (WHO), MÌ©decins Sans FrontiÌ¬res (MSF), and UNICEF have launched ""awareness-raising"" campaigns and provide ""free patients"". In the field, NGOs are working to improve access to drinking water and a ""response plan"" to the USD 9 million epidemic has been prepared. Elmounzer Ag Jiddou, MSF's head of mission in Niger, urged the country's authorities and all organizations to ""ensure adequate water supply and sanitation"".To curb the scourge, the Nigerian Ministry of Health regularly calls ""populations to vigilance"" and to go to a health center as soon as symptoms appear. Fever, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dark urine are the main signs of hepatitis E, a liver disease caused by a virus that is transmitted fecally-orally, mainly via contaminated water.The Diffa region, which has suffered attacks from Boko Haram since 2015, is home to more than 300 000 refugees and displaced persons, thousands of whom live at the expense of a very poor local population, according to the UN.--communicated by:ProMED-FRA<promed-fra@promedmail.org>[Maps of Niger can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Niger.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32620>.The following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N, Koren G. Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015; 61(7): 607-8; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501603/>.""Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).Hepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 per cent to 25 per cent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 per cent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 per cent to 50 per cent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).""References----------6.
