Despite this, case fatality rates have remained low (0.4 percent), with one death reported in an indigenous case to date. 7 severe malaria cases and 2 cases of malaria in pregnancy have been reported. There are also anecdotal reports of recrudescence.To date, the disease has been localized to the city of Praia on Santiago Island without any further spread.A handful of cases have also been detected on neighboring islands (Sao Vicente, Sal, and Porto Novo); however, their infections were likely all acquired during travel to Praia or overseas, with no evidence of onward local transmission.The malaria epidemic in Cabo Verde has begun to show early signs of improvement but the situation remains tenuous, with heavy rainfall continuing between August and October, health officials said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The last news from ProMED from 4 Sep 2017 (archive no. 20170904.5293108) reported 116 cases of malaria in Praia.
