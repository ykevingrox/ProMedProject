He said that the national policy on meningitis now stipulates that before any case is confirmed as being that of meningitis, a blood sample or cerebra-spinal fluid must have been diagnosed at a government approved medical laboratory. It is the results from such a laboratory that will confirm the case as being that of cerebra-spinal meningitis, he said.The commissioner said that those persons suspected to be suffering from the disease had commenced treatment with antibiotics.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] More states, Vaccine ShortageDate: Fri 31 Mar 2017Source: Click on Detroit [edited]<http://www.clickondetroit.com/health/meningitis-outbreak-in-nigeria-kills-nearly-300>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 282 people have died since Nigeria was struck with a meningitis outbreak. The agency reported a wide outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis across 15 states.A new strain of the disease called ""stereotype C"" has emerged, and there are not enough vaccines against it, the Center for Disease Control warned.""There is a vaccine available,"" Chief Executive Chikwe Ihekweazu said, ""but it is not commercially available for the stereotype involved in this specific outbreak, and we have to make application to the World Health Organization for the vaccines.""Nearly 2000 suspected cases have been recorded, and 109 have been treated since the outbreak began in February 2017.An emergency response team has been sent to the 5 states in the northwest of the country.As one of the 26 countries in the African ""meningitis belt,"" Nigeria records some of the highest incidences of the disease on the continent. The outbreaks peak in the dry season in certain states due to the low humidity and dusty conditions and usually end as the rainy season approaches, Ihekweazu added.""Meningitis is a tough disease, especially during this period, and it is associated with overcrowding; understanding the living conditions in the country, people must keep their building ventilated,"" he said. According to the WHO, even when the disease is diagnosed early, and adequate treatment begins, 5 percent to 10 percent of patients die, typically within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.Some common symptoms are stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting.Local and international organizations are working together to manage the epidemic. ""We believe that our concerted efforts will bring this outbreak under control, as we also work towards preventing outbreaks of this scale in the future,"" the Center for Disease Control stated.[Byline: Stephanie Busari]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Prior ProMED-mail posts reported that a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C outbreak is occurring in the northwestern states of Nigeria, with Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara accounting for almost 90 percent of cases (see ""see also"" section below).
