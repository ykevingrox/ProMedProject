La Crosse Tribune [edited]<http://tinyurl.com/y9vgsaqn>The La Crosse County Health Department is investigating 8 cases of a ""particularly nasty form"" of the _E. coli_ bacterium that forced the hospitalization of 6 children. Some of the children have recovered and been released from the hospital, said Paula Silha, education manager at the Health Department who declined to name where the children live for privacy concerns. The families are concerned about messages that might appear on social media, in particular, Silha said.The variant in these cases, _E. coli_ O157, is ""a particularly nasty form, which produces a toxin that can be harmful to the body organs such as the kidneys,"" Silha said. The hospitalized children had developed hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS], a toxin that can damage kidneys, she said.The Health Department is working with the Wisconsin Division of Health to contain the outbreak, Silha said. The ongoing investigation has not identified a single source of infection or contamination.The 1st reports came in early in [September 2017], and additional people are being tested, she said. _E. coli_ is transmitted by eating contaminated food or water and by contact with fecal material from infected people or animals, she said.Annual reports for the past several years indicate an average of 2 to 3 cases a year, although 30 were counted [in 2016], Silha said, adding, ""I cannot tell from the annual report if they were all related to one outbreak or if they came in a few at a time.""Person-to-person spread of bacterium is possible and may occur in family settings, day care centers, and nursing homes. Children younger than 5 and the elderly are the most susceptible to infection from _E. coli_. Signs and symptoms include severe abdominal cramps and loose and bloody diarrhea. Symptoms occur an average of 3 to 5 days after exposure. Some individuals become infected but do not develop symptoms.Precautions for the public include:- washing hands with plenty of soap and water. Special attention should be given to washing hands after using the bathroom, when changing diapers, before preparing food and eating, and after coming in from outside activities;- parents need to supervise hand washing for their young children to ensure adequate washing;- parents and caregivers should keep ill children out of school and day care until their medical adviser approves returning. The Health Department recommends children stay home until they have been symptom free for 48 hours (2 days).""Hand washing is the big thing in infection control,"" Silha said. ""_E-coli_ is always around,"" but this outbreak is particularly concerning, she said.[Byline: Mike Tighe]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8732>.

ProMED would like more information regarding exposures in this outbreak.To have 8 cases with 6 having HUS suggests, since HUS occurs usually in less than 10 percent of cases, that there have been substantial numbers of, as yet, undiagnosed cases. Other possibilities for a high risk of HUS include a more virulent strain or overutilization of antimicrobials early in the illness. Especially in children with diarrheal illness, especially with overt blood, with significant abdominal pain and no fever, physicians should avoid antimicrobials which will increase the risk of HUS.Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS; whether the same effect would occur in adults; whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly; and what the mechanism of the effect is, are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some being defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).References----------1.
