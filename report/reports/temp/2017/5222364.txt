Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/portugal-hepatitis-outbreak-tops-400-cases-72562/>In a follow-up to the hepatitis A outbreak in Portugal, 402 cases have been confirmed since the beginning of 2017, according to local media. The majority of cases occurred in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley regions. This is up from 322 cases one month ago.According to the latest DGS data, this outbreak, which began at the beginning of 2017 and affects other European countries, affected mainly men (88 per cent), who in more than half the cases (52 per cent) contracted [the infection] via sexual contact. In view of the outbreak of hepatitis A, the DGS reinforced vaccination prior to the major summer festivals and advised that preventive measures should be taken during these events and after surveillance for hepatitis A-compatible symptoms.Most people who are infected recover completely. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not develop into chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and death from hepatitis A infection is rare.[byline: Robert Herriman]--communicated by;ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The reported number of infections has continued to increase in Portugal and other countries in the EU.Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:- men who have sex with men;- people who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs;- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42>.]
