El Pais [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/maestra-grave-contraer-hantavirus.html>A school teacher from Soriano is currently in the Fray Bentos intensive care unit affected by [a] hantavirus [infection]. According to the physicians, her status for the past 15 days [has been] delicate.The individual is a young 24 year old working as a substitute teacher in a Soriano rural school according to Paolo Centomo, the Rio Negro deputy director of health. Initially, leptospirosis was suspected, but tests results ruled out this disease and led to confirmation that it is [a] hantavirus [infection].Both leptospirosis and hantavirus[es] are transmitted in rodent excrement. ""This teacher had an epidemiological history because she was cleaning a storage shed that had been closed for a long time, and saw rodent excrement [there]. She wanted to clean it to make a recreational center for children, and later she began to have symptoms,"" Centomo indicated to Fray Bentos Channel 11.The physician stated that the disease could be acquired by breathing [dust] in very closed spaces such as storage buildings, where forage [accumulated by rodents] accumulates and produces dust in the air. ""Because of this, recommendations indicate that when going into [these closed areas] use mouth protection, ventilate the area and apply bleach just after going in,"" the professional stated. The Soriano health director, Alejandro Crosi, stated that the young woman currently presents with a generalized infection.The Soriano authorities have not confirmed the source of the infection but stated that the school ""is clean"". Field work was done. An evaluation of the school was done and it was in perfect condition, absolutely clean. There was nothing to make one think of the presence of rodents; the surrounding areas were very clean,"" Crosi stated to Agesor.The health director explained that the pathology does not manifest itself ""so much time later"", referring to the cleanup of the storage shed that had been done 60 days before. The investigation to determine the origin of the disease does not discount the possibility that she became ill in her home.The 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Uruguay was diagnosed in 1997; up to the year 2013 there were 164 cases. The main symptoms are fever, muscle and abdominal pain, nausea and then respiratory insufficiency. When the case is acute, it requires hospitalization of the patient and respiratory assistance.[byline: Daniel Rojas]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above does not mention which hantavirus was responsible for this or earlier cases in Uruguay. Although not mentioned specifically, the infections, and certainly the deaths, will have resulted from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Central Plata hantavirus could be the etiological agent responsible for these HPS cases. Its rodent host is the yellow pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys flavescens_, complex of rodents. This rodent reservoir host sheds the virus in its saliva, urine and feces, contaminating the environment in which it lives and breeds.An image of this rodent can be accessed at <http://www.reservacostanera.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/colillargo.jpg>.This report was brought to our attention by Kathryn Soderholm <kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>, whom we thank. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/28995>.]
