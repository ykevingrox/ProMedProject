The fears of the spread became heightened because the nomadic Fulani were the 1st to die of the disease in these areas."" he added.He suggested that the entire population of Kwara State be immunised against the disease. He identified lack of resources for massive investigation, ignorance, and fear of disclosure as reasons for the poor detection of yellow fever cases in the state.The head of the research team at NCDC [Nigerian Center for Disease Control] in Kwara State, Dr William Nwachuku, had during the stakeholders' meeting in Ilorin, said that findings in communities revealed the prevalence of yellow fever virus and its carriers, a special breed of mosquitoes, in all the areas.In addition to mass vaccination and immunisation, he urged the state government to embark on personal hygiene and environmental sanitation enlightenment campaign.But the Kwara State Commissioner for Health, Dr Sulaiman Alege, said he was neither aware of the spread of the disease nor any death as a result of yellow fever in the state.Alege said, ""Basically, the information (of the spread of the disease) is not to my own confirmation because we are on ground here and we are working with the National Primary Child Development Agency National Primary Health Care Development Agency and the NCDC.""Maybe the information they are giving you is not that it has spread to other LGAs, but that we want to conduct immunisation in 9 other LGAs of Kwara State. The NPHDA [National Primary Healthcare Development Agency] intends to extend the programme to 2 wards of Yagba East and Yagba West of Kogi State that are very close to Ifelodun.""None of such deaths is our information and there is no reported case of any death as regards yellow fever in Kwara State. UITH [University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital] had been on strike and is just resuming, I do not know where they got it.""[Byline: Success Nwogu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of yellow fever (YF) cases is not clear. The original report is of a single case. Then a 2nd case was diagnosed with YF in Oro-Ago in Ifelodun local government area of Kwara state. Later, only one laboratory confirmed yellow fever (YF) case was mentioned. The report above is conflicting. The Kwara state Government confirmed only 2 cases of YF in the state, but that number is immediately contradicted stating that 11 out of 17 yellow fever patients taken to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital had died. Apparently there are 8 additional deaths at 3 other hospitals. If, in fact, there are more than the 2 cases reported originally, the situation there is serious and immediate response with a vaccination campaign in all the affected areas is needed. The previous report indicated that a vaccination campaign was planned to begin in Ifelodun local government area of Kwara by 30 Sep 2017. The report above does not mention that the vaccinations have begun. YF can quickly get out-of-hand if vaccination is not started immediately, as happened in the outbreak in Angola recently.ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving a clarification of the number of confirmed and suspected cases and the status of the vaccination effort.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19690>. - Mod.TY]
