The News [edited]<https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/220615-Brain-eating-bug-claims-fourth-victim-in-city>A woman in Karachi has died of meningitis caused by the dreaded microorganism _Naegleria fowleri_, raising the year's total death toll due to the brain-eating bug to 4 in the city, it was learnt on [Tue 1 Aug 2017].""AS, 48, and a resident of the Karimabad area of District Central, died this [Sun 30 Jul 2017] at a private hospital due to meningitis caused by _N. fowleri_,"" the Sindh government's focal person for _Naegleria fowleri_, Dr Zafar Mehdi, told The News.He said the woman had been suffering from extreme headaches, nausea and drowsiness for some days, adding that she was taken to the Patel Hospital in Gulshan-e-Iqbal on [Sat 29 Jul 2017] when her condition worsened. ""Within 24 hours of her admission to the hospital, she succumbed to the deadly infection.""According to health officials, _N. fowleri_ has killed 46 people across Sindh since 2011. Meanwhile, a recent study by some Pakistani experts at the University of Dammam in Saudi Arabia and the University of Karachi found that between 2008 and 2015, 110 people in Sindh died due to primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by _N. fowleri_. Published in the Archives of Pharmacy Practices last year [2016], the study found that the highest number of cases was reported in 2012 when 22 people in Pakistan died of the waterborne infection.The researchers said majority of the _N. fowleri_ deaths in the country between 2008 and 2015 occurred in the month of July. The mean temperature of the month was between 35å¡C and 39å¡C [95å¡F and 102.2å¡F], while the majority of the cases were reported in Karachi.Saudi Arabia-based Pakistani specialists said that no individual who contracted the disease was able to survive, adding that adults between the ages of 26 and 45 years were the most affected. All of the deaths occurred in the Muslim community, concluded the study. ""In the beginning, PAM-related deaths occurred mainly in males,"" says the study. ""However, female deaths have also been reported recently. Cross tabulating the variable of year with patient age group revealed that individuals from all ages ... were reported dead due to the pathogen.""The study by foreign experts further revealed that chlorination of the municipality water supply in Karachi was below the World Health Organization recommended level of 0.5 parts per million (ppm). Data from 913 water samples taken from different parts of the city in 2012 reported 201 water samples to have chlorination below 0.5ppm. In 2014, another 2094 water samples were drawn across the city and reported low chlorination. The subsequent year [2015] also reported similar results.On the other hand, leading water technologist and expert Dr Ahsan Siddiqui said that due to deteriorating water supply lines in Karachi and other issues, chlorinated water does not reach the consumers. He advised the people to clean their underground and overhead water tanks as well as to use liquid bleach regularly. ""It is found that _N. fowleri_ remains present in the layer of mud in the water tanks ... and whenever it finds favourable temperatures, it activates."" He said 10 drops of liquid bleach killed all the pathogens and microorganisms in one cubic feet of water containing 28 litres [7.39 gallons], reiterating the need for regular cleaning of underground and overhead water tanks to get rid of N fowleri colonies.[byline: M Waqar Bhatti]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The 1st case of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) was detected in Karachi in 2012 [<http://www.nih.org.pk/files/Newsletter/Guidelines_%20Primary%20Amebic%20Meningoencephalitis%20(PAM)%20june%202014.pdf>]. Only 4 out of 143 known infected individuals in the USA have survived between 1962 and 2016 (over 97 per cent fatality rate) [< https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html>]. The morbidity and mortality associated with PAM is likely to be increased unless prompt measures to clean water reservoirs in residents and mosques and disinfect water.Most _Naegleria fowleri_ infections are associated with swimming in warm freshwater lakes and rivers. However, very rarely, _Naegleria fowleri_ has caused deaths associated with tap or faucet water going up the nose [<https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/tap-faucet-water.html>.] Naegleria fowleri can grow in public and private water tanks and pipes, especially where little or no disinfectant (like chlorine or chloramine) is present. It can also grow in the pipes and water heaters of homes and buildings._Naegleria fowleri_ infections have been reported when people put their heads underwater, rinse their sinuses through the nose, and cleanse their noses during religious practices using contaminated tap or faucet water.PAM and _Naegleria fowleri_ infection can be diagnosed in the laboratory by detecting: - _Naegleria fowleri_ organisms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), biopsy, or tissue specimens, or - _Naegleria fowleri_ nucleic acid in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens, or - _Naegleria fowleri_ antigen in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens [<https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/diagnosis.html>].Because of the rarity of the infection and difficulty in initial detection, about 75 per cent of diagnoses are made after the death of the patient.Based on the treatment regimens used in the survivors, the following combination of drugs is recommended for treatment of PAM in various combinations; amphotericin B, azithromycin, fluconazole, rifampin, miltefosine and dexamethasone [<https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/treatment-hcp.html>]. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/707>.]
