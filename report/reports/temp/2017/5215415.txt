It can even cause death. The strain, known as ST313 [ST is short for sequence type], has been found in Brazil, reports an article in the July 2017 edition of the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution. Until now, it had been recorded only in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it kills a quarter of people who fall ill, particularly vulnerable patients infected with HIV or malaria, and malnourished children.""These results should alert [health] authorities in the country, because infections with this bacterium are not subject to mandatory reporting, said Cristiano Gallina Moreira. Unlike other subtypes of _S._ Typhimurium, ST313 is readily able to cross from the gut into the bloodstream. The research team sequenced the genomes of 88 strains of _S._ Typhimurium in the labs of the US Food and Drug Administration. They isolated the strains from stool, blood and brain abscess samples collected from infected people, and also from contaminated foods gathered from across Brazil between 1983 and 2013. They found the ST313 strain in samples isolated between 1989 and 2003 in Sao Paulo, the country's largest and richest city. The team also verified that the ST313 strain invades and replicates in phagocytes (cells that protect the body from infection) more easily than do other _Salmonella_ varieties.Biomedical scientist Fernanda Almeida, from University of Sao Paulo's Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeiro Preto (FCFRP-USP) and lead author of the research, says that, unlike the African strain, the new strain does not show signs of antibacterial resistance. ""But the Brazilian ST313 is much more aggressive and invasive, which is a problem,"" she told SciDev.Net._S._ Typhimurium is one of the main causes of gastroenteritis globally. It can infect livestock such as pigs and lambs, and people can get infected by eating contaminated or improperly cooked meat. For biologist Cristiano Gallina Moreira, from the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Sao Paulo State University, the rise of a new strain of _S._ Typhimurium in Brazil is ""very worrisome.""According to Vanessa Sperandio, a biochemist from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the USA, sequencing the ST313 genome will help to accelerate the diagnosis of salmonellosis and more efficiently control potential outbreaks of the disease. But she pointed out that although this strain is much more dangerous than others, pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to develop a vaccine due to the low return on investment.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The reference to this important work is: Almeida F, Aparecida Seribelli A, da Silva P, et al: Multilocus sequence typing of Salmonella Typhimurium reveals the presence of the highly invasive ST313 in Brazil.

The following 2 publications report on mechanisms related to ST313's facilitation of a ""systemic lifestyle"" like _S._ Typhi and Paratyphi A:Carden S, Okoro C, Dougan G, Monack D: Non-typhoidal Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 isolates that cause bacteremia in humans stimulate less inflammasome activation than ST19 isolates associated with gastroenteritis. Pathog Dis. 2015 Jun;73(4). pii: ftu023. doi: 10.1093/femspd/ftu023.Abstract----Salmonella is an enteric pathogen that causes a range of diseases in humans. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars such as _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium generally cause a self-limiting gastroenteritis whereas typhoidal serovars cause a systemic disease, typhoid fever. However, _S._ Typhimurium isolates within the multi-locus sequence type ST313 have emerged in sub-Saharan Africa as a major cause of bacteremia in humans. The _S._ Typhimurium ST313 lineage is phylogenetically distinct from classical _S._ Typhimurium lineages, such as ST19, that cause zoonotic gastroenteritis worldwide. Previous studies have shown that the ST313 lineage has undergone genome degradation when compared to the ST19 lineage, similar to that observed for typhoidal serovars. Currently, little is known about phenotypic differences between ST313 isolates and other NTS isolates. We find that representative ST313 isolates invade non-phagocytic cells less efficiently than the classical ST19 isolates that are more commonly associated with gastroenteritis. In addition, ST313 isolates induce less Caspase-1-dependent macrophage death and IL-1Ã«  release than ST19 isolates. ST313 isolates also express relatively lower levels of mRNA of the genes encoding the SPI-1 effector sopE2 and the flagellin, fliC, providing possible explanations for the decrease in invasion and inflammasome activation. The ST313 isolates have invasion and inflammatory phenotypes that are intermediate; more invasive and inflammatory than _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi and less than ST19 isolates associated with gastroenteritis. This suggests that both phenotypically and at the genomic level ST313 isolates are evolving signatures that facilitate a systemic lifestyle in humans [It appears that the next to last sentence is reversed and should be ""...less invasive and inflammatory than _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi and more than ST19 isolates associated with gastroenteritis."" - Mod.LL].Ramachandran G, Perkins DJ, Schmidlein PJ, Tulapurkar ME, Tennant SM: Invasive Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 with naturally attenuated flagellin elicits reduced inflammation and replicates within macrophages.

A novel genotype of _Salmonella enterica_ subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (multi-locus sequence type [ST] 313) circulating in this geographic region is genetically different to from _S._ Typhimurium ST19 strains that are common throughout the rest of the world. _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains have acquired pseudogenes and genetic deletions and appear to be evolving to become more like the typhoidal serovars _S._ Typhi and _S._ Paratyphi A. Epidemiological and clinical data show that _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains are clinically associated with invasive systemic disease (bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis) rather than with gastroenteritis. The current work summarizes investigations of the broad hypothesis that _S._ Typhimurium ST313 isolates from Mali, West Africa, will behave differently from ST19 isolates in various in vitro assays. Here, we show that strains of the ST313 genotype are phagocytosed more efficiently and are highly resistant to killing by macrophage cell lines and primary mouse and human macrophages compared to ST19 strains. _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains survived and replicated within different macrophages. Infection of macrophages with _S._ Typhimurium ST19 strains resulted in increased apoptosis and higher production of proinflammatory cytokines, as measured by gene expression and protein production, compared to S. Typhimurium ST313 strains. This difference in proinflammatory cytokine production and cell death between _S._ Typhimurium ST19 and ST313 strains could be explained, in part, by an increased production of flagellin by ST19 strains. These observations provide further evidence that _S._ Typhimurium ST313 strains are phenotypically different to ST19 strains and instead share similar pathogenic characteristics with typhoidal _Salmonella_ serovars. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
