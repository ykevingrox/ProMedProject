IA Komsomolskaya Pravda, Donetsk [in Russian, trans. Mod.NP, edited]<https://www.donetsk.kp.ru/online/news/2886094/>Fish in L'viv poisoned more than 70 people, the most massive poisoning in the last 10 years. The number of people affected as a result of foodborne illness from the fish bought in the L'viv market has grown to 71 people. This was reported by the press service of the Department of Civil Protection of the L'viv Regional State Administration on its Facebook page. ""As of 6:00 on 2 Oct 2017, a total of 71 people were affected by the outbreak of infection, including 7 children,"" the ministry said. In addition, there are 6 people in outpatient care, including 1 child, who have consulted a doctor, but refused to be hospitalized.After conducting laboratory tests, all patients were diagnosed with salmonellosis. The condition of one patient is severe, the rest are in the hospital, in close to satisfactory condition.As reported in the L'viv regional laboratory center, the current poisoning has become the most massive in the city over the past 10 years.This is not the 1st outbreak of salmonellosis in Ukraine. Prior to this, diseases in the Rivne region were recorded.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>viaProMED-RUS<promed-rus@promedmail.org>[Although salmonellosis is not generally considered high on the list of fish-borne illnesses, it certainly does occur, as reflected in this recent review:Barrett KA, Nakao JH, Taylor EV, et al. Fish-associated foodborne disease outbreaks: United States, 1998-2015. Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2017; 14(9): 537-43.Abstract--------""Each year in the USA, about 260 000 people get sick from contaminated fish. Fish is also the most commonly implicated food category in outbreaks. We reviewed the CDC Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System for outbreaks resulting from consumption of fish during the period 1998-2015. We found 857 outbreaks associated with fish, resulting in 4815 illnesses, 359 hospitalizations, and 4 deaths. The median number of illnesses per outbreak was 3 (range: 2-425). The annual number of fish-associated outbreaks declined from an average of 62 per year during the period 1998-2006 to 34 per year during the period 2007-2015. Hawaii (221 outbreaks [26 percent]) and Florida (203 [24 percent]) reported the most outbreaks. Among 637 outbreaks (74 percent) with a confirmed etiology, scombrotoxin (349 [55 percent]), and ciguatoxin (227 [36 percent]) were by far most common. Most outbreak-associated illnesses were caused by scombrotoxin (1299 [34 percent]), _Salmonella_ (978 [26 percent]), and ciguatoxin (894 [23 percent]). Most hospitalizations were caused by _Salmonella_ (97 [31 percent]) and ciguatoxin (96 [31 percent]). Norovirus (105 average illnesses; range: [6-380]) and _Salmonella_ (54 [3-425]) caused the largest outbreaks. Fish types implicated most often were tuna (37 percent), mahi-mahi (10 percent), and grouper (9 percent). The etiology-fish pairs responsible for the most outbreaks were scombrotoxin and tuna (223 outbreaks), scombrotoxin and mahi-mahi (64), and ciguatoxin and grouper (54). The pairs responsible for the most illnesses were scombrotoxin and tuna (720 illnesses) and _Salmonella_ and tuna (660). Of the 840 outbreaks (98 percent) with a single location of food preparation, 52 percent were associated with fish prepared in a restaurant and 33 percent with fish prepared in a private home. Upstream control measures targeted to the most common etiologies and controls during processing and preparation could further reduce outbreaks caused by fish.""It is likely that in many of the cases, the fish is contaminated after harvesting. This may not be the case with all serovars of _Salmonella_ (especially serovars Paratyphi B and Weltevreden) (1-3)1. Noor Uddin GM, Larsen MH, Barco L, et al.
