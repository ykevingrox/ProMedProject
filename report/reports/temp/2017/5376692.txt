The Japan Times [edited]<https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/10/11/national/science-health/tick-borne-sfts-disease-spreads-via-dog/#.Wd-oKEzMx-U>A man in his 40s in Tokushima Prefecture has acquired the tick-borne disease known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, through contact with a dog, local government said [Tue 10 Oct 2017].It is the 1st case of the infection transmitted through a dog, according to the health ministry. The man suffered from fever and vomiting but has already recovered.In late June [2017], the dog was diagnosed with the SFTS virus after the man took it to a veterinary hospital, the prefectural government said.The pet owner 1st reported feeling ill in mid-June and took a blood test after the dog was found to be infected with the SFTS virus. The test result showed in late September [2017] that the man was also infected.He did not have any apparent signs of mite bites but SFTS virus antibodies detected in the blood test suggest that he had been infected within the previous few months. The [virus] infection may have entered his body through his mouth or a break in the skin.The dog is a house pet, which likely became infected while it was out for a walk.This year [2017], 70 cases of SFTS infections have been recorded, bringing the total to about 300 since the 1st confirmed case in Japan in 2013.In July [2017], the ministry said a woman in her 50s died of a tick-borne disease last year [2016] after being bitten by a stray cat when she was trying to carry it to a veterinary hospital. Tissue samples showed she was infected with the SFTS virus, the world's 1st confirmed case of the illness being contracted from a mammal (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd - Japan 20170726.5204931).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[With 70 confirmed SFTS cases, this endemic virus disease continues to be a public health problem in Japan. As noted in previous posts, SFTS cases have been reported in Japan before. In 2013, the total number of cases came to 8, and while at that time the 1st 5 were all deaths, these 3 people, infected between 2005 and 2012, all recovered. In 2014 SFTS virus infected 53 people and left 21 people dead. SFTS virus has been shown to be tick transmitted. In the above report as well as the previous one involving an infected cat, SFTS virus can be acquired from household pets. These cases are an excellent One Health example of how it is important for veterinary and human health practitioners to need to be in close communication when these related cases occur.SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the bunyavirus family. Characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described first by Yu XJ et al in ""Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China"" (N Engl J Med. 2011; 364(16): 1523-32; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095>). - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>]
