Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(7); doi: 10.3201/eid2307.170226----------------------------------------------------------------------In the USA, recreational water is a relatively uncommon source of Shiga toxin-producing [enterohemorrhagic] _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) O157 outbreaks (1). We describe an outbreak of EHEC O157 infections among children exposed to a contaminated stream in northern California, USA, and provide laboratory evidence establishing wildlife as the source of water contamination.In May 2016, 4 cases of Shiga toxin (Stx) 1- and 2-producing _E. coli_ O157 infection were reported to a local health department in northern California; investigation revealed a common source of exposure. The case-patients, ranging in age from 1 to 3 years, had played in a stream adjacent to a children's playground within a city park. Exposure of the case-patients to the stream occurred on 3 separate days spanning a 2-week period. 2 case-patients are known to have ingested water while playing in the stream. 2 case-patients were siblings. All case-patients had diarrhea and abdominal cramps; bloody diarrhea was reported for 3. One case-patient was hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome.The stream is a 2nd-order waterway located in a northern California community of about 7500 residents. At the time of exposures, stream flow was less than 30 cubic feet/sec. The land upstream is not used for agricultural activities such as livestock production. The community is serviced by a public sewer system; inspection of sewer lines indicated no breach to the system.Water samples were collected from the exposure site 7 days after the last case-patient was exposed and weekly thereafter for 17 weeks; samples were tested quantitatively for fecal indicator organisms. Throughout the study period, all water samples exceeded recreational water quality limits for _E. coli_ and enterococci levels (2). Water samples were also cultured for EHEC isolation and PCR detection of stx1 and stx2 (3). Stx1- and Stx2-producing _E. coli_ O157 were isolated from stream water each week for the 1st 4 weeks. Additionally, an Stx2-producing _E. coli_ non-O157 strain was isolated from the stream in the 1st week of sampling. Enrichment broth cultures of water samples were also positive by PCR for _stx_1 and _stx_2 for the 1st 4 weeks of sampling. Thereafter, both _stx_1 and _stx_2, or _stx_2 only, were intermittently detected in enrichment broth cultures for 9 additional weeks.In the absence of an obvious source (such as, upstream agricultural operation or sewer leak), wildlife was considered as a possible contributor to water contamination. 13 fresh wildlife scat specimens were collected along the stream for STEC culture and PCR. Of the 13 scat specimens, 8 originated from deer, 2 from raccoon, and 1 each from coyote, turkey, and river otter. 6 scat specimens (4 deer, 1 coyote, 1 river otter) were positive for _stx_1 and _stx_2 or for _stx_2 by PCR. Stx1- and Stx2-producing _E. coli_ O157 were isolated from deer scat and coyote scat. An Stx2-producing _E. coli_ non-O157 strain was isolated from a deer scat specimen. The animal origin of the coyote and river otter scat specimens were definitively identified by partial DNA sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome b (4).To assess strain relatedness, we compared EHEC O157 isolates from the case-patients, water, deer scat, and coyote scat by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) (5). PFGE patterns for XbaI-digested genomic DNA were highly similar among all isolates; only slight variations were found in the lower-sized bands (Figure [for figure, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). PFGE patterns for genomic DNA samples digested with BlnI also demonstrated a high degree of similarity (data not shown). Furthermore, MLVA profiles were identical for the case-patient, water, and deer scat isolates; only the coyote scat isolate differed from the main profile by 2 repeats at a single locus (VNTR_3).This study provides laboratory evidence linking EHEC O157 infections with the ingestion of recreational water that was probably contaminated by wildlife scat. Wild ruminants, including deer and elk, are known carriers of EHEC and have been connected to outbreaks of human infections (6-9). We detected EHEC in 50% of deer scat specimens collected from the stream bank. One of these specimens, found 1.5 miles upstream of the exposure site, contained an _E. coli_ O157 isolate that was highly similar by molecular subtyping to case-patient and water isolates. These findings support the likelihood that feces from deer carrying EHEC were the source of water contamination or, at the very least, contributed to the persistence of EHEC in the water. It is unknown whether the EHEC detected in coyote and river otter scat represents carriage or transitory colonization within these animals.The common risk factor among the case-patients in this EHEC O157 outbreak was exposure to a natural stream within a city park. After the outbreak was recognized, signs warning of bacterial contamination were posted along the stream. No further EHEC O157 infections attributed to stream water exposure were reported.References----------1.

The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, and other livestock or wild animals [or humans. Mod.LM]. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.Swimming-associated transmission is illustrated in the references.1.
