Health department officials went to the child's home and surrounding properties and removed some containers of standing water, WHIZ reports.The health department says most people infected with the disease do not show signs of illness. According to the CDC, some initial symptoms include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness. Severe cases occur most often in children under 16 and often involve an inflammation of the brain and can include seizures, coma, and paralysis.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There was a previous case reported in Ohio in 2015. As noted in that and previous cases, this above Ohio case occurred in one of the focal La Crosse virus (LACV) endemic areas. Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur, and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal.The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus maintained through transovarial transmission.LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio, and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at <http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>). There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA.The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at <http://www.cdc.gov/LAC/index.html>.An image of _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_ can be seen at: <http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=2166>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the USA showing the location of Ohio in the upper Midwest can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19549> and at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237>. - Mod.TY]
