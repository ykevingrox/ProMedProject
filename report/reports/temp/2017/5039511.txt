Daily Times [edited]<http://dailytimes.com.pk/editorial/13-May-17/measles-outbreak>The dark shadow of measles is hovering across Balochistan as the disease has started taking its toll on children. It has been reported that during the past week, measles has claimed the lives of at least 8 children in Balochistan's Killa Abdullah district. The number of children affected by the disease is increasing, as the measles virus spreads through the air when a patient coughs or sneezes. Its symptoms include fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) and tiny white spots with bluish-white centres on a red background found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek.Opposition to vaccination is an obvious reason for the spread of the disease. A serious outbreak of measles in Balochistan and elsewhere in the country could well be the result of a drop-off in vaccinations. The grim situation is worsening in different cities of the province due to lack of healthcare facilities and delayed diagnosis. While the government officials and the health department are claiming that adequate arrangements have been put in place to tackle the menace, the reality looks bleak, with the number of measles cases increasing. There are clear indications that delayed diagnosis resulted in fatalities that could have been avoided.In order to contain deaths due to this disease, the provincial government needs to take preventive measures. A countrywide awareness campaign needs to be launched on an immediate basis that could educate the masses about the symptoms of the disease and inform them about curative measures. As most cases are being reported from Balochistan, the provincial government needs to take all necessary measures to protect victims from this deadly disease. There is a need to put all health facilities on alert to tackle the situation. The government needs to arrange vaccines and other necessary medicines and diagnosis facilities at public health facilities for early detection and treatment of the disease. There is a need to take all necessary measures to save the people from the disease. There is also a need to improve the level of coordination among the concerned authorities. Quick measures are needed at the provincial and federal levels to prevent the epidemic from spreading to other parts of the country.--Communicated by:George RobertsonPATH<grobertson@path.org>[Maps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://pakistanmap.facts.co/pakistanmapof/PakistanAdministrativeMap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>. - Mod.LK]******[2] South Africa (Gauteng Province)Date: Sat 13 Mar 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/gauteng-province-measles-outbreak-now-17-cases-mass-measles-vaccination-campaign-month-82980/>In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in Gauteng Province, South Africa, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has reported 17 cases of measles in Gauteng from March-April 2017.This follows an outbreak of 31 cases in the Western Cape in January-February 2017. The Western Cape outbreak was controlled by a vaccination campaign in that province, which reached more than 450 000 children. From January-April 2017, there have additionally been 4 cases from Northwest province, 1 from Eastern Cape, 1 from Mpumalanga and 1 from Limpopo province.This has prompted the Department of Health to start a mass measles vaccination campaign for the month of May 2017 for Gauteng Province and the end of June 2017 for other provinces.The campaign is targeting children aged between 6 months and 5 years.In the city of Johannesburg, the campaign will include children from 6 months to 15 years.Measles is a viral infection, spread from person to person through saliva by coughing, sneezing or being in close contact with an infected person. Symptoms include fever, a rash and a flu-like illness. Complications can include lung infection (pneumonia), diarrhea, dehydration, blindness, brain infection (encephalitis) or death. Most people recover fully from measles, but complications are unpredictable.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of South Africa can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/south_africa_prov_map2.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179>. - Mod.LK]******[3] USA (Minnesota, Le Sueur county)Date: Mon 15 May 2017Source: Le Sueur News-Herald [edited]<http://www.southernminn.com/le_sueur_news_herald/article_40d55cb3-8631-55ea-bac5-9050c3528ca1.html>The Minnesota Department of Health has confirmed 2 cases of measles in Le Sueur County.These are the 1st confirmed measles cases in south central Minnesota in 2017.

""We are working collaboratively with MDH and other partners including the South Central Healthcare Coalition and Emergency Management to make sure people have accurate and up to date information regarding the measles outbreak.""MDH investigates how individuals become infected, identifies people known to be exposed, monitors them for symptoms, and informs them of recommended protective actions. ...County Public Health officials are encouraging people to check their immunization records to make sure they are vaccinated. Measles can spread very easily among unvaccinated people, so the best way to protect yourself and your community is to make sure everyone who is able receives the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.MDH is recommending an ""accelerated"" vaccination schedule for children and adolescents of the 2 dose MMR series in counties with a confirmed case of measles. Children (12 months and older) and adolescents should have 2 doses of MMR. The 1st dose is given at 12 months, and with the accelerated schedule can by followed by a 2nd dose 28 days later.For more information about measles, visit the MDH website at <http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/measles/index.html> or the Le Sueur County website at <http://www.co.le-sueur.mn.us/>.[Byline: Suzy Rook]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Minnesota can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354>.

The latest outbreak includes more than 50 cases, nearly all in Hennepin County and in Minneapolis, but there are at least 2 cases out of state. Nearly all of the cases are Somali-Americans. Public health officials are working hard to contain the outbreak, and we can be thankful that we are not anywhere near the 460 cases and 3 deaths that occurred in 1990.Ironically, announcements of new cases coincided with a presentation in Minneapolis by one of the leaders of the anti-vaccine movement that sees vaccinations as a cause of autism. Some 90 people attended. Many were Somali. A few were critics of the anti-vax movement who went to hear their opponent and express their disagreement.As in most situations, there are economic factors at play. The core economic idea here is that vaccinations against infectious diseases have ""external effects."" That is, they impact people other than an individual actually getting the vaccine. Such effects can be negative, or ""external costs,"" think pollution, where one person's actions harm someone else. But they also can be positive, also called ""spillover benefits,"" where one person's actions to meet their own needs benefits others.When there are no external effects, either positive or negative, then letting individuals make their own choices about what goods and services they buy results in an optimal outcome for society. One attendee at the anti-vaccination presentation, the mother of a child who developed autism after having been vaccinated, articulated this sentiment: ""If the consequences are greater than the benefits, it's better to leave it alone."" Such individual weighing of alternatives certainly is true for some medical situations. ...Vaccinations against communicable diseases are different, however. Get your children vaccinated and they will be much less likely to get the disease. Often, they will be completely protected. Benefits go beyond that, however. One person vaccinated is also one less person who can transmit the disease to others. The more people are vaccinated, the less risk for everyone and the less likely that an epidemic will break out. At some point, usually around 90 percent, you achieve ""herd immunity."" If someone bearing the disease flies in from elsewhere, he may transmit it to a few other people, but the disease will die out because most of the people will be immune because of vaccination. So, getting the shot not only protects the patient, but also reduces risk for others. There is a spillover benefit.Yet just as uncontrolled external costs reduce efficient use of resources in meeting people's needs, so poorly incentivized spillover benefits do the same. The incentive may be a ""carrot,"" some individual reward, or it may be the ""stick"" of mass government mandate. But without some government action to provide such incentives, be it carrot or stick, the outcome will not be optimal for society.Of course, when the perceived direct individual benefit is great enough, people will seek the vaccination in any case. 60 years ago, polio struck such fear into parents that they fought to get their kids included in the initial trials of the injected Salk vaccine. My cousin spent weeks in Minneapolis's Sister Kenny Institute and had a hand permanently withered from polio. My mother made sure that my sister and I got the 4-shot series twice, just to be sure.Of course, there always have been skeptics. I remember a neighbor telling my mother that she, herself, would never take ""the needle of death."" And it is not a coincidence that most recent measles outbreaks have occurred in isolated cultures or communities, Somali, Amish and Orthodox Jewish, that are suspicious of mainstream values.Vaccinations are a special case of spillover benefits in that the level at which other people seek the treatment affects the expected costs of not getting it yourself. If you do not get vaccinated, but most other people do, your own risk is minimal because of herd immunity. There is an incentive to ""free ride,"" getting the benefit from others being vaccinated without incurring any of the real or imagined risks yourself.The fact that vaccination programs drastically reduce the number of cases skews people's estimation of the danger of the disease. Getting measles is no longer the common experience that it was in my childhood. Most people do not personally know anyone who got extremely ill or died from the disease. They do know people from my age cohort who had it and survived. So, they underestimate how serious measles can be.There is an element of ""survivorship bias"" at play here. Just as we know the Warren Buffetts who get rich managing investment funds but don't know about the thousands of others with apparently similar qualifications who failed, we know myriad people over age 50 who survived measles, mumps and rubella, but we don't know the ones who died.Behavioral psychologists and economists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky examined how humans perceive risk. Usually, we overestimate dangers from unfamiliar risks, like being killed by terrorists, and underestimate familiar risks, like being killed by a texting driver. Measles is different. Nowadays, most people are not personally familiar with measles. But because they know parents and grandparents survived it, they discount the danger. Autism is more real, everyone knows someone with an autistic child. So regardless of scientific consensus that there is no link between vaccination and autism, many people worry that there is.So there is an ""information problem,"" another reason for which a free market can fail to allocate resources optimally. In many cases, these is a simple lack of information. ...With vaccinations, scientists say anti-vaccine parents are not making a decision with a lack of information. Rather, they believe wrong information. And so society as a whole is worse off, but with most of the harm concentrated among those who relied on erroneous beliefs.Society is better off if people are vaccinated against communicable diseases based on the best scientific information available. But medical treatments are very personal, and government compulsion skates on very thin ice. Early mandatory vaccination programs met strong resistance, such as the one against smallpox in Brazil a century ago that caused riots with 30 dead, hundreds injured, and thousands jailed or sent into internal exile. That level of resistance has passed, but too much use of sticks is counterproductive. The carrot of public education is better, but one should remember the ancient Greek aphorism that ""against ignorance, even the gods struggle in vain.""[Byline: Edward Lotterman <stpaul@edlotterman.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is interesting reading on how people make a decision to not be vaccinated, even in the face of clear scientific data as to its safety and benefit, and even in light of the potential severity of the disease and threat to the community. - Mod.LK]******[6] TajikistanDate: Mon 15 May 2017Source: Relief Web [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/tajikistan/tajikistan-measles-outbreak-emergency-plan-action-epoa-operation-n-mdrtj025>Tajikistan: Measles outbreak - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) Operation; Report from International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies-------------------------------A. Situation analysis: Description of the disasterThe measles epidemic in Tajikistan started in April 2017 gradually spreading out of Rudaki district to the capital city of Dushanbe and the surrounding districts as well as Khatlon oblast. In mid-April 2017, 263 registered cases of measles were reported, out of which 157 were laboratory confirmed. Based on official data, by 1 May 2017, the number of notified and investigated cases rose from 263 to 345, with 246 (71%) patients hospitalized. No deaths were reported so far.The trend of sharp increases in new cases is expected to continue. Out of the 48 new cases recorded during week 16 (17-23 Apr 2017), 96 per cent were unimmunized. The proportion of affected adults in this outbreak is somewhat higher (16.7%) than during the previous outbreak in 2009 (10.5%). The total proportion of unvaccinated persons affected by the epidemic among the total population increased from 81.9% in week 15 to 84% in week 16.The group most affected by the epidemic are children between 1-9 years of age. This also corresponds to the cohort born after the last national measles and rubella (MR) immunization campaign conducted in 2009. Normally, the immunization centre of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) carries out immunization on an annual basis in case of approx. 97 per cent of this cohort. The remaining 3 per cent, however, tends to remain nonimmunized, including migrants, gypsy, and displaced people.In response to the outbreak, the MoHSP is preparing to conduct a nationwide MR vaccination campaign targeting children aged 1- 9 years from 15-26 May 2017 with the support of the Measles and Rubella Outbreak Response Initiative (MRI) Fund. The Government of Tajikistan already agreed on a draft decree declaring the national immunization campaign against measles with relevant ministries and submitted it for parliamentary approval.--Communicated by:George RobertsonPATH<grobertson@path.org>andProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Tajikistan can be found at <http://bit.ly/2pT5TQD> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/141>. - Mod.LK]
