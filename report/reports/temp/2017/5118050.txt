EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]This problem is known in the EU since at least 10 years with outbreaks related to proved local fish consumption documented at least in Canary Islands (Spain) and Madeira (Portugal), see for example:[ref: Canals A, DiogÌ¬ne J, Gago A. EuroCigua, risk characterization of ciguatera food poisoning in Europe. ECsafeSEAFOOD Project - Final Conference, 25-26 Jan 2017; <http://www.aecosan.msssi.gob.es/AECOSAN/docs/documentos/ciguatera/ABSTRACT_EUROCIGUA_ECSAFESEAFOOD_CONFERENCE.pdf>]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------""Since 2008, autochthonous ciguatera food poisoning (CFP) outbreaks have been reported in Spain (Canary Islands) and in Portugal (Madeira). In the Canary Islands the fish genus _Seriola_ was involved in many of the outbreaks. _Gambierdiscus_ spp., microalgae responsible for CFP, was also detected in the waters of the Madeira and Canary Islands. In order to characterize the risk of CFP in the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and 14 European organizations have signed a Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) that is co-funded by EFSA aimed to characterize the risk of ciguatera food poisoning in Europe (EuroCigua). The main goal of Specific Agreement (SA) no. 1 is the management and the scientific coordination of the project. It is coordinated by the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs Food Safety and Nutrition (AECOSAN). The SA no. 2 aims to determine the incidence of ciguatera in Europe and the epidemiological characteristics of cases, and it is coordinated by the Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII). The assessment of the presence of ciguatoxin in food and the environment is the main objective of SA no. 3, coordinated by the Institute for Research and Technology in Food and Agriculture (IRTA). Finally, the SA no. 4 is coordinated by the University of Vigo (UVigo), whose main target is to develop and validate methods for the detection, quantification, and confirmation of the presence of ciguatoxin contaminated specimens. This innovative project joins efforts of research organizations, epidemiology institutions and competent authorities on food safety from several European Member States. The project has strong links to European institutions and international research institutions across the world in order to use this experience for the characterization of this intoxication in Europe as well as its impact in public health. The project started in June 2016 and will run for 4 years.""[Ref: Nunez D, Matute P, Garcia A, et al. Outbreak of ciguatera food poisoning by consumption of amberjack (_Seriola_ spp.) in the Canary Islands, May 2012. Euro Surveill. 2012; 17(23): pii=20188; <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20188>]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------""In May 2012 a family outbreak of ciguatera food poisoning, affecting 4 people, was detected in Tenerife, Canary Islands. The outbreak was caused by eating amberjack fish (_Seriola_ spp.) bought in a local market. This is the 3rd outbreak of ciguatera food poisoning in the Canary Islands in 2012. We describe the epidemiology of this outbreak.""The problem is well known and the articles are now referring to recent initiatives trying to better characterize the risk at EU level as Canary Islands and Madeira only represent islands that are quite far from the EU ""mainland"" (actually closer to Africa). In particular, the EU Food Safety Agency (EFSA) is currently implementing a cooperation project involving 13 different official organizations from 6 EU countries to better define this risk in the entire EU (EUROCIGUA) <http://www.aecosan.msssi.gob.es/AECOSAN/web/ciguatera/home/aecosan_home_ciguatera.htm>.So far, cases related to local consumption only in Canary Islands and Madeira (technically EU but actually geographically closer to Africa). Other cases, as the ""German outbreak"" were related to imported fish.In the past ciguatera local cases have been reported in relation to consumption to fish in the Mediterranean Sea, so this could happen again, but nothing recalling any recent increase. Example, in 1988, Israel coast: [ref: Raikhlin-Eisenkraft B, Finkelstein Y, Spanier E: Ciguatera-like poisoning in the Mediterranean. Vet Hum Toxicol. 1988; 30(6): 582-3; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3245127>]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------""A case of group poisoning from the consumption of the fish _Sarpa salpa_, caught in the Mediterranean coastal waters of Israel, is presented. Mullets and rabbitfish caught at the same site caused no harm. This is the 3rd case of ciguatera poisoning in the region and the 1st to be transferred by a fish which is not a Red Sea immigrant. It implies that toxic algae dinoflagellates, originating from the Red Sea, crossed the Suez Canal and found their way to the Mediterranean coastal waters.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED thanks a member of the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project for contributing this valuable information regarding ciguatera in the Mediterranean area. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010>.]
