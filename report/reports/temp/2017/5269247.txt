El Sol de Zacatecas [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]<https://www.elsoldezacatecas.com.mx/municipios/detectados-19-casos-de-brucelosis>The Ministry of Health of Zacatecas, through Health Jurisdiction Number IV, confirmed that up to now there have been 19 cases of brucellosis, the pertinent measures have been taken, and those affected are being taken care of.RaÌ¼l Pinales Sarabia, coordinator of Sanitary Jurisdiction number IV, which includes the municipalities of Francisco R MurguÌ a (Nieves); Juan Aldama, Miguel Auza, CaÌ±itas de Felipe Pescador, and Rio Grande, reported that for the time being, 19 cases of brucellosis have been detected in these 5 municipalities. He explained that there are 3 cases registered in the municipality of Francisco R MurguÌ a, 3 cases in the municipality of Juan Aldama, 3 more in CaÌ±itas de Felipe Pescador, 4 in Miguel Auza, and 6 in the municipality of Rio Grande.He explained that the departments of both epidemiology and sanitary regulation are responsible for dealing with this type of cases: ""It is the responsibility of sanitary regulation to carry out the sampling of products, especially goats' cheese and thus verify that they are free of this disease, and the department of epidemiology performs the sampling for confirmatory tests at the state level, which is why there are 19 cases already confirmed.""He also pointed out that once these cases are confirmed, medical treatment is started, which consists of streptomycin and tetracycline administered for 21 days. ""This disease, like many others, is serious if left untreated. After 21 days we wait a month before we do another sampling and send it back to the state laboratory to confirm that the patients are free of the disease; if not treatment continues until the person is healthy,"" he said.Finally he said that people should be very careful when consuming goat cheeses and people who work and live with sheep and goats should do so with the care that this entails, to avoid being infected by brucellosis.[byline: IvÌÁn MÌÁrquez]--communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[Brucellosis is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was first described over 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See <http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm>.The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case.The post does not state if the diagnoses were made by culture or by serology. A previous post in March 2017 reported only 5 cases. It is not clear over what period the 19 cases occurred.Maps of Mexico can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/mexico_pol97.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7840>.
