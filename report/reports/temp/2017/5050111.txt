Six of these cases occurred before the clinical alert and were retrospectively identified. As of May 12, 2017, a total of 77 U.S. clinical cases of _C. auris_ had been reported to CDC from 7 states: New York (53 cases), New Jersey (16), Illinois (4), Indiana (1), Maryland (1), Massachusetts (1), and Oklahoma (1) (Figure). All of these cases were identified through cultures taken as part of routine patient care (clinical cases). Screening of close contacts of these patients, primarily of patients on the same ward in health care facilities, identified an additional 45 patients with _C. auris_ isolated from 1 or more body sites (screening cases), resulting in a total of 122 patients from whom _C. auris_ has been isolated.Among the 77 clinical cases, median patient age was 70 years (range = 21-96 years), and 55 percent were male. _C. auris_ was cultured from the following sites: blood (45 isolates), urine (11), respiratory tract (8), bile fluid (4), wound (4), central venous catheter tip (2), bone (1), ear (1), and a jejunal biopsy (1). Antifungal susceptibility testing at CDC of the first 35 clinical isolates revealed that 30 (86 percent) isolates were resistant to fluconazole (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] >32), 15 (43 percent) were resistant to amphotericin B (MIC ä´2), and 1 (3 percent) was resistant to echinocandins (MIC >4). Most (69, 90 percent) clinical cases were identified in the New York City metropolitan area (53 in New York and 16 in New Jersey). Nearly all patients had multiple underlying medical conditions and extensive health care facility exposure. Epidemiologic links have been found between most cases. In Illinois, 3 cases were associated with the same long-term care facility. In New York and New Jersey, cases were identified in multiple acute care hospitals, but further investigation found most had overlapping stays at interconnected long-term care facilities and acute care hospitals within a limited geographic area. The case in Massachusetts was linked to the Illinois cases. The cases in Indiana and Oklahoma occurred in patients who had recently received health care in other countries.Testing for _C. auris_ colonization, using a composite swab of the groin and axilla, was conducted for 390 close contacts of the 77 patients in 3 states, primarily patients on the same ward in health care facilities because of the risk for environmental contamination and transmission from health care personnel. The 2 body sites tested were selected based on results of previous investigations. 45 (12 percent) colonized persons were identified (24 in New Jersey, 17 in New York, and 4 in Illinois). Contact Precautions were recommended for colonized patients in health care facilities. Nasal swabs also were collected from 184 (47 percent) contacts; 2 swabs (1 percent) were positive, both from patients with positive groin/axilla swabs. Environmental testing of patients' rooms identified _C. auris_ from mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops, indicating _C. auris_ environmental contamination. _C. auris_ was not isolated from rooms after thorough cleaning with a sodium hypochlorite-based disinfectant.All _C. auris_ isolates were forwarded to CDC for whole-genome sequencing and comparison with previously sequenced international isolates, which clustered into 4 distinct clades (2). Isolates from within each state were highly related. New York isolates, with the exception of 1 clinical and 1 screening case, were highly related to one another and grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia. Isolates in New Jersey also were similar to those from South Asia but were distinct from those in New York. Illinois isolates were nearly identical to one another and grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the United States followed by local transmission.Ongoing investigation of U.S. _C. auris_ cases provides epidemiologic and laboratory data suggesting that this fungus can spread within health care facilities and those interventions are needed to prevent transmission during this early stage of _C. auris_ emergence. As of May 2017, recognized U.S. _C. auris_ cases were concentrated in health care facilities in 3 separate geographic areas, and most cases were in chronically ill patients with long stays at high-acuity skilled nursing facilities (e.g., facilities providing mechanical ventilation). Apart from 1 case identified in 2013, clinical laboratories serving health care facilities with _C. auris_ cases have not identified suspected _C. auris_ isolates from before 2015 from retrospective microbiology record reviews, suggesting recent _C. auris_ emergence in those locations. However, the disease might exist elsewhere, because some laboratories do not fully characterize _Candida_ species or are otherwise unable to detect _C. auris_.CDC has worked with state and local partners to develop and share infection control recommendations to help curb the spread of _C. auris_ (3). Current recommendations for _C. auris_-colonized or infected patients include 1) use of Standard Precautions and Contact Precautions, 2) housing the patient in a private room, 3) daily and terminal cleaning of a patient's room with a disinfectant active against _Clostridium difficile_ spores (an update from previous disinfectant recommendations) (4), and 4) notification of receiving health care facilities when a patient with _C. auris_ colonization or infection is transferred. Accurate identification of _C. auris_ and adherence to infection control practices, coupled with ongoing public health surveillance and investigations, are needed to halt the spread of _C. auris_ in the United States.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, nosocomial, multidrug resistant pathogen associated with a high mortality. Epidemiologic investigations in the U.S. reported above revealed most cases in each state had exposure to common healthcare facilities or had recently received healthcare in other countries and testing in these facilities identified widespread environmental _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms. Genotyping of isolates by whole genome sequencing indicated that isolates were highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia, but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the United States followed by local transmission within healthcare settings. Antifungal susceptibility testing at CDC isolates were commonly resistant to fluconazole and many were also resistant to amphotericin B, but isolates were uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin) (3%). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
