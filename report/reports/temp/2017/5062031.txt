Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/05/new-resistance-gene-found-salmonella-isolated-chickens>A team of Canadian scientists has identified a gene that confers resistance to the broad-spectrum antibiotic fosfomycin, according to a study yesterday [Mon 22 May 2017] in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy [1].The gene, dubbed fosA7, was found in 15 _Salmonella enterica_ isolates from broiler chickens in British Columbia. The isolates were of the _Salmonella_ Heidelberg serotype, which is commonly identified in poultry and has become one of the leading causes of salmonellosis in humans. In recent years, Heidelberg strains have become more resistant to antibiotics, limiting therapeutic options. The gene was also found in 3 other _Salmonella_ serotypes--Agona, Montevideo, and Tennessee.Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing showed that the gene was exclusively located on the chromosome of the _Salmonella_ Heidelberg isolates, the concern is that fosA7 could potentially be spread to other strains of _Salmonella_ and other families of bacteria if transferred to plasmids--small, floating pieces of DNA that can be shared among bacteria through a process known as horizontal gene transfer.""If it's on the chromosome, and it jumps to the plasmid, and the plasmid gets into another [type of bacteria], then the situation becomes worse,"" corresponding author Moussa Diarra, PhD, a research scientist with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, told CIDRAP News.Increased use of fosfomycin in human and veterinary medicine would then increase the prevalence of the gene.To see whether fosA7 could be transferrable, the scientists made a clone of the gene and copied it onto a plasmid inserted into a sample of the _Salmonella_ serotype Enteritidis. Antibiotic susceptibility tests on the modified Enteritidis strains showed that a more than 256-fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fosfomycin was needed to prevent growth of the bacteria.""These results further suggest the fosA7 is responsible for fosfomycin resistance and if transferred on plasmids, it can induce a high level of resistance in the recipient bacterial strain,"" the authors write.Fosfomycin is an older, well-tolerated antibiotic with activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It has been used to treat a variety of human infections, including urinary tract infections, and is considered a safe alternative for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, including those caused by _Salmonella_. The existence of a gene that could lead to the failure of fosfomycin would be highly problematic.""It's an important antibiotic,"" Diarra said. ""If we have resistance to it, too, then [treatment] becomes complicated."" As a result, Diarra and his colleagues call for ""vigilant monitoring"" for the spread of fosfomycin resistance in bacteria isolated from humans and animals.Nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ causes an estimated 1.2 million foodborne illnesses and about 450 deaths each year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency's most recent estimate of antibiotic-resistant _Salmonella_ infections put the burden at 6200 cases annually.[1. Rehman MA, Yin X, Persaud-Lachhman MG and Diarra MS.

Posted online 22 May 2017. doi: 10.1128/AAC.00410-17][Byline: Chris Dall]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The following is the abstract of the journal article referenced in the news report above:""ABSTRACT---------""We previously described _Salmonella_ Heidelberg harbouring a chromosomal gene cluster similar to the glutathione S-transferase gene, a putative fosA conferring resistance to fosfomycin. Here we show that this new gene named fosA7 confers resistance to fosfomycin. Introduction of fosA7 into fosfomycin susceptible _Salmonella_ Enteritidis resulted in a substantial increase in the fosfomycin MIC. This finding increases awareness of antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ Heidelberg from broiler related to the food safety and public health.""Fosfomycin, a natural bactericidal, broad-spectrum antibiotic discovered in 1969, has been available for clinical use in many European countries as well as Japan, South Africa, and Brazil, in both oral and parenteral formulations, for up to 4 decades (<https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2016/2082693/>). In the United States and Canada, only an oral formulation is available for clinical use for the past 2 decades to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infection as a single oral dose (<https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2016/2082693/>). Fosfomycin is not widely used in veterinary medicine except in countries in Central and South America (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/29/2/321.full>).Fosfomycin irreversibly inhibits phosphoenolpyruvate transferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the 1st step of peptidoglycan synthesis of microbial cell walls. It is not structurally related to other classes of antimicrobial agents and thus does not exhibit cross-resistance with other classes of antibiotics.Fosfomycin resistance mechanisms include reduced permeability, modification of the gene target, and modification of fosfomycin by enzymes such as fosA, fosB, fosC, and fosX, several of which are encoded on plasmids (<https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkr466>). Fosfomycin-resistant determinants integrated into mobile genetic elements such as plasmids could facilitate rapid spread of fosfomycin resistance if selected by increasing use of fosfomycin; and, if fosfomycin resistance is genetically linked to resistance to other antibiotics on mobile genetic elements, fosfomycin resistance could be co-selected by other antibiotics (<https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkr466>).Fosfomycin resistance is currently rare in the United States (<https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2016/2082693/>). Because of increasing rates of antibiotic resistance of _E. coli_ to current standard empiric antibiotic regimens, fosfomycin is now being recommended for the 1st-line empirical oral treatment of community-acquired uncomplicated urinary tract infections (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/e103.full>, <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11908-013-0315-7>). However, the plasmid-encoded fosA3 gene, similar to those found in China, where fosfomycin resistance was said to be commonly described, has already been reported in a patient in Pennsylvania, USA (<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/11/15-0750_article>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12>.]
