Families have been forced to drink slimy, infected water after the rains failed and wells and rivers dried up. ""We are very close to famine,"" Heffinck said.Somalia is one of 4 African countries at high risk of famine.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - Malawi (Southern Region)Date: Mon 27 Mar 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/new-cholera-outbreak-flares-malawi-24493/>The outbreak began on 11 Mar 2017, and laboratory testing revealed that the agent was _Vibrio cholera_ Ogawa O1. As of 24 Mar 2017, a total of 14 cases with no deaths have been reported.Nsanje district shares borders with Mozambique. The initial cluster of cases was found to have epidemiological linkage with Villa Nova, Tete province in Mozambique, which is reported to be having an ongoing cholera outbreak. Malawi has been experiencing recurrent outbreaks of cholera, especially in the southern region. This region is prone to either floods or droughts; both conditions favor propagation of cholera infection. The poor sanitation and hygiene practices in these communities are some of the factors contributing to cholera transmission. In addition, the continuous cross-border activities taking place between Malawi and Mozambique (that is reported to have ongoing cholera outbreaks) is likely to lead to subsequent trans-boundary transmission of cholera.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Diarrhea, fatal - Ethiopia (Somaliland)Date: Sat 25 Mar 2017Source: Somaliland Sun [edited]<http://menafn.com/1095345157/Somaliland-Sultan-Commends-Ethiopian-Response-after-Outbreak-of-Diarrhea-In-Daroor-District>Within the last 24 hours, 8 people have succumbed to severe diarrhea in the Daroor district, Zone 5 Somali administrative region of Ethiopia. This was reported by Sultan Ahmed Osman 'Cabdoo-gude during an interview with The Horn Tribune in Hargeisa, where he also commended Ethiopian federal authorities for apt emergency response.Although Daroor is in Ethiopia, Ethiopian Sultan Cabdoo-gude, who is based in Somaliland, is the traditional leader of the affected clan resident in Daroor. Denying circulating rumors that over 300 people have died as a result of the malady in Daroor, Sultan Cabdoo-gude said that, to his very well informed knowledge, not more than 20 people have died so far.""I can inform you that over 100 people have been hospitalized at the Daroor district hospital and a number of emergency hospitals established by the government of Ethiopia in outlying areas,"" said the Sultan. Of the 8 who recently died, the traditional leader said that 6 were young children and 2 adults who were unable to reach medical facilities in time.[Byline: Yusuf M Hasan]******[4] Cholera - Yemen (Washah province)Date: Sat 1 Apr 2017Source: Al-Arabi news [in Arabic, trans.

Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015; oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
