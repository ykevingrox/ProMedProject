On Guam, mosquitos are a natural pest but never in Guam history has an illness been reported as a result of the pesky critter until now as the Department of Public Health and Social services announced the 1st confirmed report of dengue fever on Guam.Public Health announced on [Fri 1 Sep 2017] that they have confirmed a suspected case of imported dengue fever on Guam, which means the disease was not contracted on island. Dengue fever is a disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily the yellow fever mosquito which is not found on Guam. However, the Asian tiger mosquito, which can also carry the virus, does exist on Guam. As a result, Public health cautions the public to be vigilant in preventing the transmission of the disease and eliminating mosquito breeding sites.<http://pacificnewscenter.com/first-ever-dengue-fever-confirmed-on-guam/>Europe------Portugal. 22 Sep 2017. A species of mosquito that carries and transmits the dengue virus has been identified for the 1st time in Portugal, in the northern region of the country. However, the DGS said that so far ""there is no evidence of increased risk to the health of the population.""<http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/dengue-mosquito-found-for-first-time-in-portugal/43263>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] DiagnosisDate: Mon 18 Sep 2017 10:56 am JSTSource: Nikkei Asian Review [edited]<https://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Science/Portable-device-speeds-up-dengue-virus-identification>A team led by a professor from the University of Tokyo has devised a fast and cost-effective method of determining dengue fever virus types using a portable DNA sequencer.Use of the palm-sized device will hopefully be able to speed up diagnosis at hospitals in developing countries and also help trace the path of infection.There are 4 types of the virus that causes dengue fever, a mosquito-borne tropical disease. A patient with a history of infection from one type can develop severe symptoms if infected with another. The team led by Yutaka Suzuki, a professor at the University of Tokyo, as well as Hokkaido University in northern Japan, has taken MinION, a next-generation nanopore DNA sequencer developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in the U.K., and applied it to the identification of the virus types.The process starts with serum being separated from a blood sample taken from an infected patient. Ribonucleic acid in the serum carrying the genetic information of the virus is then detected and converted to DNA fragments which are amplified for sequencing.The DNA sequencer can now read the DNA information and a computer linked to the device converts it into nucleotide sequence data. This can now be cross-referenced with a database of genetic information to determine which type of virus the patient is infected with. In partnership with local hospitals, the project studied viruses from infected patients and discovered that the DENV-1 type of the virus wasdominant in Indonesia, while the DENV-3 type was more common in Vietnam. The prevalence of virus types in different regions could help identify infection routes.The handheld MinION nanopore DNA sequencer comes at a fraction of the price of existing solutions. Until now, identification has relied on conventional methods of amplifying DNA using a polymerase chain reaction or large, advanced genetic sequencers, which typically fall well outside health care budgets in the developing world.[Byline: Kento Fukui]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A handy tool for field application. - Mod.UBA[HealthMaps for Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia can be found at <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/?p=148>, for Europe, at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010>, and the Pacific, at <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/?p=377>. - Mod.ML]
