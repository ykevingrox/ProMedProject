May it lay the groundwork for improved reporting.Elephants acquire this disease through grazing though they are primarily browsers. Because of the difficulties of controlling wildlife anthrax in African national parks, it is a widespread problem in the parks. And this presents a threat to livestock grazing in proximity to such parks. If I were to guess it would be that this kudu paid the price of its curiosity in investigating these elephant carcasses and maybe from consuming some of their extravasated blood. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/177>.]
