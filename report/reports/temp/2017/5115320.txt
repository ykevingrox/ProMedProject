Canal 44, Mexico [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]<http://canal44.com/siete-personas-con-paralisis-facial-por-bacteria-en-sonora/>A total of 7 people were affected in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, by the bacterium _Campylobacter jejuni_, which caused a severe acute facial paralysis. One of those affected by the bacterium died. The secretary of Health of Sonora, Gilberto Ugson Beltran, confirmed this information, according to <Proyectopuente.com.mx>.The state official indicated that the patients contracted the bacterium from water consumption [see comment below - Mod.JH], but did not clarify whether the infection was from consumption of drinking or purified water. He clarified that the outbreak is controlled and in the past 21 days no new cases have occurred. He added that 6 years ago there had already been an outbreak of the bacteria in the area of the USA adjacent to the municipality of San Luis Rio Colorado and Baja California.Every year, _Campylobacter jejuni_ affects millions of people around the world. In addition, the microorganism can cause autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease or Reiter's arthritis.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Sat 17 Jun 2017Source: Diario Noticias [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]<http://www.diarionoticias.info/alertan-por-brote-de-guillain-barre/>The City Council of San Luis, through the Municipal Public Health Department, has warned of an outbreak of the Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS], of which 6 cases have already been registered, with 1 death, between April and May 2017. In turn, the municipal administration rejected that the drinking water of the city is the cause of the disease, as published by a state media outlet.Mayor Enrique Reina Lizarraga stated that according to studies carried out by the State Public Health Laboratory, at the request of the Municipal Health Committee, the possibility that water has caused the problem was discarded.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[In the 1995 paper by Rees, et al (1), _C. jejuni_ was found to be associated with GBS as recent campylobacteriosis was found in 26 percent of patients with GBS as compared to 1 per cent of matched controls. Of note, the GBS cases associated with _C. jejuni_ were significantly associated with the poorer outcome of slow recovery and residual disability. Although no specific serotype of _C. jejuni_ was linked to GBS in the study above, a subsequent paper (2) found that serotype O:19 strains were overrepresented in USA and Germany cases of GBS and these strains were likely to be serum-resistant.Subsequently, it has been found that the pathophysiology of the association was an example of antigenic mimicry (3). That is, the lipooligosaccharide of certain _C. jejuni_ strains cross reacted with human GM1 ganglioside and, in rabbits, anti-GM1 antibody was elicited following _C. jejuni_ lipooligosaccharide and limb weakness developed. Additionally, Bax, et al (4) reported that differences in sialic acid linkage of the bacterial saccharide produced different modulations of the immune response which could explain why some organisms may be linked to GBS and others not.References----------1.

Abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21502591>.- Mod.LL][According to the article at <http://proyectopuente.com.mx/2017/06/16/descartan-presencia-bacteria-causa-paralisis-en-agua-potable-slrc/> (in Spanish) the 6 water samples analyzed by the Baja California State Health Secretariat were negative for _Campylobacter_, confirming that the drinking water is not the source of the outbreak. The Municipal Health Director suggests that it is common for chicken to be contaminated by the bacterium and therefore it is more likely that this was the source. This seems more probable given that the prevalence for the organism in susceptible avian species ranges from 0 to 100 percent, with higher rates observed in the summer. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ/Mod.JHMaps of Mexico can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/northamerica/political-map-of-Mexico.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12779>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12779>.]
