Scrub typhus, dengue and chikungunya cases are on the rise.More than 4 chikungunya cases have been detected among suspected cases. Likewise, at least half a dozen dengue viruses have been detected so far in Kathmandu. _Aedes agypti_ and _A. albopictus_ serve as vectors for both dengue and chikungunya, and these vectors are well established in Kathmandu; thus, there is a need for a high level of vigilance from the concerned bodies of the Nepal government.So far, at least 140 cases of scrub typhus have been confirmed by laboratory testing in Kathmandu, prompting fresh questions about potential sources of infection and how it is spreading rapidly in Kathmandu, which deserve further research. Other diseases such as murine typhus and West Nile virus infection are also potential threats to Kathmandu, since these emerging diseases have already been reported in Kathmandu in the past [1,2].References:1.

For dengue and chikungunya, measures for vector control and management must be put in place to control the common mosquito vectors. - Mod.UBAProMED HealthMaps:Nepal: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/139>Kathmandu, Central Region, Nepal: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2877>].................................................uba/msp/mpp"
