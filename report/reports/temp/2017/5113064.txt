ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report [edited]<http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Communicable-disease-threats-report-9-june-2017.pdf>Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection present in some tropical areas of Africa and South America. On 6 Jan 2017, Brazil reported an outbreak of yellow fever that started in December 2016 and is still ongoing. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Suriname have also reported cases of yellow fever in 2017.Between 18-31 May 2017, Brazil has reported 34 additional confirmed cases of yellow fever in the states of EspÌ rito Santo (24 [cases]), Minas Gerais (5), Rio de Janeiro (3), Distrito Federal (1) and Mato Grosso (1). These are the 1st confirmed cases of locally-acquired yellow fever in Distrito Federal and Mato Grosso since the beginning of the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Sat 17 Jun 2016Source: Relief Web [edited] <http://reliefweb.int/report/brazil/brazil-yellow-fever-dref-operations-update-n-1-mdrbr008>Brazil is experiencing its largest outbreak of yellow fever in decades; the outbreak is mainly occurring in the states of Minas Gerais and Espiritu Santo, which have the largest number of confirmed cases. However, the disease has spread to other regions in the country, affecting 407 municipalities.On 13 Jan 2017, the Ministry of Health declared a public health emergency in the state of Minas Gerais. According to the last epidemiological report from the Ministry of Health dated 31 May 2017, the distribution of cases and deaths have doubled and expanded since this Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) was published; this report further states that 3240 suspected cases of wild-type yellow fever were reported, of which 792 were confirmed (24.5 percent), 519 are still being studied (16 percent), and 1929 (59.5 percent) were ruled out, with a fatality rate of 34.5 percent. In total, 83.1 percent of the cases involved men between 16 and 65 years of age.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Apparently, the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Brazil is not over. The latest PAHO/WHO summary for Brazil issued on 24 May 2017 indicated that the last human cases occurred during week 16 (6-22 Apr 2017). The above report indicates that cases have occurred after that time. The reported cases are presumably human ones and not monkeys. Cases in non-human primates have been very widespread in Brazil this year (2017), having been reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Amazonas, Bahia, GoiÌÁs, EspÌ rito Santo, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, ParÌÁ, ParaÌ ba, ParanÌÁ, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, RondÌ«nia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, SÌ£o Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins. (see Yellow fever - Americas (47): Brazil, PAHO/WHO Archive Number: 20170530.5071826). The above 34 recent, confirmed cases are probably spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission and not the urban, _Aedes aegypti_ transmitted cycle, or surely that would have been mentioned, and the alarm bells would have been sounded.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.
