Nigeria Centre for Disease Control Weekly Epidemiological Report 7(30) [edited]<http://www.ncdc.gov.ng/reports/weekly>1. Lassa feverPlease note that the data reflects the routine reports i.e. all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases1.1. Up to 12 suspected cases of Lassa fever were reported from four LGAs [local government areas] (3 States; Edo - 10, Nasarawa - 1 and Plateau - 1) in week 30, 2017 compared with 14 suspected cases with 2 Laboratory confirmed cases reported from 3 LGAs (3 States) at the same period in 2016.1.2. Laboratory results of the 12 suspected cases are 2 positives for Lassa fever (Edo -2) while 8 were negative for Lassa fever and other VHF (Edo - 8) while 2 pending (Nasarawa - 1 & Plateau - 1).1.3. Between weeks one and 30 (2017), 366 suspected Lassa fever cases with 88 laboratory confirmed cases and 56 deaths (CFR, 15.30 percent) from 68 LGAs (22 States) were reported compared with 760 suspected cases with 74 laboratory confirmed cases and 87 deaths (CFR, 11.45 percent) from 128 LGAs (27 States) during the same period in 2016 (Figure 1).1.4. Between weeks one and 52 2016, 921 suspected Lassa fever cases with 109 laboratory confirmed cases and 119 deaths (CFR, 12.92 percent) from 144 LGAs (28 States and FCT) were reported compared with 430 suspected cases with 25 laboratory confirmed cases and 40 deaths (CFR, 9.30 percent) from 37 LGAs (14 States and FCT) during the same period in 2015 (Figure 2).1.5. Investigation and active case search ongoing in affected States with coordination of response activities by the NCDC with support from partners.1.5.1. National Lassa Fever Working Group meeting and weekly National Surveillance and Outbreak Response meeting on-going at NCDC to keep abreast of the current Lassa fever situation in the country.1.5.2. Response materials for VHFs prepositioned across the country by NCDC at the beginning of the dry season1.5.3. New VHF guidelines have been developed by the NCDC (National Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Preparedness guidelines, Infection Prevention and Control of VHF and Standard Operating Procedures for Lassa fever management) and are available on the NCDC website.1.5.4. Ongoing reclassification of reported Lassa fever cases1.5.5. Ongoing review of the variables for case-based surveillance for VHF1.5.6. VHF case-based forms completed by affected States are being entered into the new VHF management system. This system allows for the creation of a VHF database for the country.1.5.7. NCDC team sent to Edo State to support Lassa fever data harmonization and Updating of VHF case-based management database1.5.8. Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment/isolation centres across the States with Ribavirin and necessary supportive management also instituted1.5.9. Onsite support was earlier provided to Ogun, Nasarawa, Taraba, Ondo and Borno States by the NCDC and partners1.5.10. Offsite support provided by NCDC/partners in all affected States1.5.11. NCDC and partners are providing onsite support in Ondo and Plateau State1.5.12. States are enjoined to intensify surveillance and promote Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in health facilities.Figure 1: Map of Nigeria showing areas affected by Lassa fever, week one - 30, 2016 and 2017Figure 2: Map of Nigeria showing areas affected by Lassa fever, week one - 53, 2015 and week one - 52, 2016Table of cases by state, cumulative data weeks 1-30 [1 Jan-30 Jul 2017] as of 4 Aug 2017:State: Cases / Laboratory confirmed / DeathsAdamawa: 6 / 0 / 2Akwa Ibom 1 / 1 / 0Bauchi: 11 / 4 / 4Cross River: 7 / 0 / 1Ebonyi: 4 / 1 / 1Edo: 143 / 31 / 9Enugu: 1 / 1 / 1FCT: 2 / 0 / 0Gombe: 17 / 0 / 1Jigawa: 1 / 0 / 0Kadun: 1 / 0 / 0Kano: 23 / 2 / 10Katsina: 4 / 0 / 0Kebbi: 1 / 0 / 1Kogi: 3 / 1 / 129Nasarawa: 29 / 6 / 2Ogun: 13 / 1 / 0Ondo: 27 / 18 / 627Plateau: 27 / 9 / 7Rivers: 6 / 1 / 0Taraba: 38 / 12 / 9Yobe: 1 / 0 / 1Total: 366 / 88 / 55--Communicated by:Olutayo Olajide BabalobiLecturer and Consultant Epizootiologist(One Health, Participatory Epizootiology and Veterinary ICT Research Group)Department of Veterinary Public Health and Preventive MedicineFaculty of Veterinary MedicineUniversity of IbadanIbadan, Nigeria<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>[Overall, case numbers have increased by 28 confirmed, 3 laboratory confirmed and one death since [Fri 28 Jul 2017].Once again, ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above.As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
