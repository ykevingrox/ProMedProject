Currently many of the infected people are given medical attention under tree shades. The outbreak of the disease has resulted in Burco town termed as medical emergency area.Speaking to the media, Mohamed Yussuf Muraad, the mayor of Burco town said they stationed medical staff at the major entries of the town to provide medical service to those leaving or coming into the town. Responding to the medical emergency, the mayor said they are in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Education and the diverse security personnel stationed in the province and ensuring quick implementation of public hygiene awareness.""We decided from this hour that Burco town is under medical emergency situation and to redouble the awareness campaign on entry points to the town where some of our medical staff is stationed"" said the Mayor. The ongoing school examinations has been stopped in Burco town and all the students in primary, secondary schools and higher institutions were sent home in order to curtail the spread of the disease. Major rendezvous places in the town have been banned too for the local people to gather for chatting for medical reasons.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - Kenya (Nakuru county)Date: Sun 4 Jun 2017, 3:00 PMSource: The Star [edited]<http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/06/04/cholera-outbreak-in-naivasha-one-admitted_c1574006>A cholera outbreak has been reported in Naivasha with 1 patient admitted at the sub-county hospital. The male patient has been placed in an isolation ward. He was rushed to the facility complaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Following the outbreak, officers from the department of public health have been deployed in the area to contain the outbreak. The patient's house has been disinfected.The move comes barely a week after the department of public health banned food hawking outside the hospital. The department has also outlawed the dropping and picking of passengers at the hospital's gate by both matatus and motorcycle operators.According to the superintendent in charge of the hospital Joseph Mburu, the patient was responding well to treatment. He added that cholera tests conducted had turned out to be positive and said this was the 1st case in the town. ""Last week we had 2 cases of a woman and mother and her child but tests turned negative and they have since been discharged,"" he said. ""We are working with the department of public health to make sure that the ban on food hawking mainly around the hospital gate is [put into] effect,"" said Mburu.Meanwhile, the county government has moved in to rehabilitate [and] open up the clogged drainage systems in Naivasha town. This came as heavy rains continued to pound the town and its environs flooding major roads and adversely affecting the flow of traffic. According to Naivasha sub-county administrator Julius Nyaata, the exercise would target all major drainage systems in the town.[Byline: George Murage]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - SudanDate: Tue 6 Jun 2017Source: ReliefWeb, a Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-cases-swell-khartoum-bahri-hospitals>Cholera cases are further proliferating in Khartoum and White Nile states. The Health Ministry recorded 30 new cases while local sources reported about 100 infected patients in areas of Khartoum Bahri.Cholera in Khartoum has further expanded to Teibat El Ahamda, known as El Ezba, in Khartoum Bahri. On [Mon 5 Jun 2017], the number of dead from cholera rose to 18 people, while there were approximately 100 infected cases in the district's hospitals on [Sun 4 and Mon 5 Jun 2017]. The Ministry of Health in Khartoum state announced on [Mon 5 Jun 2017], that 30 new cases have been recorded. There will be ""maximum mobilisation"" at Teibat El Ahamda area, with cleaning and waste removal campaigns.H.I., a resident of El Ezba told this station that his sister died of cholera, while his 2 brothers were infected with the disease. ""El Hadj El Safi and El Amel hospitals refused to receive my brothers, forcing us to transfer them to the academic hospital in Khartoum."" He said that his brothers have recovered from the disease in time. ""However, the isolation centre in the academic hospital is overcrowded with patients, where 2 patients share one bed.""Health workers in El Ban Jadeed Hospital said that the number of cholera patients there has amounted to more than 30 infected people, allegedly including foreigners. Here, too, hospital rooms are overcrowded with patients and the shortage of beds forces people to share beds.Doctors in the Sudanese capital reported 120 new cholera cases over the weekend, [3 to 4 Jun 2017]. In a press conference in Khartoum on [Sun 4 Jun 2017], Dr El Fateh Ali El Hassan said that the Tamayoz Hospital and departments of the Khartoum Teaching Hospital received 48 new cases on [Fri 2 and Sat 3 Jun 2017]. Hospitals in Omdurman admitted 20 cases.Reports of some hospitals in Khartoum refusing to admit cholera patients surfaced during the past week [week of 29 May to 4 Jun 2017]. The Sudanese Communist Party urged the Sudanese government to take its responsibility and declare ""a cholera epidemic"" in order to receive aid from abroad.Federal Health Minister Bahar Idris Abugarda told parliament on [Thu 1 Jun 2017], that between August 2016 and May 2017 the Ministry recorded 14 659 people infected with ""watery diarrhea"". A total of 292 patients died of watery diarrhea, the term the government has used for cholera since the 1st cases were registered in Blue Nile state in September 2016. Spreading to eastern Sudan, and later to the Northern State and central Sudan's El Gezira, the disease reached White Nile state in April 2017, where a rapid spread of cholera is reported. Hospitals in North Kordofan started to receive cholera patients as well.Abdelrahman El Siddig, the head of civil society organisations in White Nile said that 5 new cases of cholera were received by health centres in Ulad Makin. These people have been transferred to El Gezira Aba and Asalaya. The isolation centre in Asalaya has been reopened to accommodate and receive new cases of cholera, a week after its closure, El Siddig said.The hospital in El Duweim, White Nile, recorded a new cholera case on [Mon 5 Jun 2017]. The number of hospitalized cases at El Duweim's isolation centre has run up to 7 people. ""Medical staff and volunteers of the Sudanese Red Crescent Society in the local hospital are working hard"" said an activist, reporting to Radio Dabanga there is a decrease in the incidences of cholera in El Duweim after witnessing an increase in the past few days.Journalist El Tahir El Doma told Radio Dabanga that the El Gezira Aba Hospital received a case from El Dibeibat. ""The clinic in El Maraabi received 7 cases. Most of them come from the nearby villages."" He added that the situation in Kosti ""seems to be contained"".The Minister of Health, Bahr Idris Abugarda, said that White Nile state has been one of the states stricken the most with the disease. Abugarda denied that the federal Ministry of Health was covering up the emergence of watery diarrhea. Abugarda responded to a question posed by independent MP Ahmad Sabah El Kheir about cholera in parliament. He replied that the doctors' response was quick and has contained the disease from the start with support teams. He said that there has been ""a wide mobilization of all people in mosques and districts, along with the armed forces, for awareness and guidance"" in combating the spread of the disease. The measures have shown positive results therein, according to the Health Minister.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Cholera - East AfricaDate: Fri 2 Jun 2017, 5:58 PMSource: Africa Times [edited]<http://africatimes.com/2017/06/02/somalias-cholera-outbreak-linked-to-drought-climate/>WHO officials say an ""unprecedented"" outbreak of cholera in Somalia is linked to the drought that began in October 2016, creating widespread shortages of clean drinking water and food. There are more than 40 000 suspected cases since the beginning of 2017, with nearly 700 deaths to date, according to WHO numbers discussed in the British medical journal The Lancet on [Fri 2 Jun 2017].""Cholera is endemic in Somalia, but Abdinasir Abubakar, an epidemiologist with WHO, said 'the severity and extent of the current outbreak is unprecedented,'"" writes author Andrew Green. Abubakar said the cholera crisis has now reached 75 percent of regions in the country though new case totals may be slowing. The death toll in Somalia's cholera outbreak was expected to double by the end of June 2017, United Nations officials.In the adjacent Somali region of Ethiopia, where 90 percent of the nation's acute watery diarrhea (AWD) reports are concentrated, there have been 33 000 such cases and 776 deaths, according to WHO. Government health officials in Ethiopia have not confirmed that those cases are actually diagnosed as cholera.""There is also the risk of international spread due to cross-border movement between Somalia, Kenya, and South Sudan, which are also experiencing the effects of the drought,"" the WHO said in last week's update on outbreaks across the continent.Nearly half of all counties in South Sudan have reported new cases in recent weeks, as the number of suspected cholera cases approaches 8000. Tanzania also continues to recover from its 2nd-worst cholera outbreak ever recorded, and the worst to hit the nation in 20 years.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
