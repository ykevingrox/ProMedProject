Hindustan Times [edited]<http://tinyurl.com/y7g7fzjt>Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered criminal action against hospital staff and the gas firm for 30 child deaths between [9-11 Aug 2017]. However, 15-18 children continue to die every day at the 950-bed Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College and Hospital; a third of these deaths are due to encephalitis.Japanese encephalitis (JE) and the deadlier acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) became the national buzzwords after 30 children died between [9-11 Aug 2017] in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur's largest government hospital, amid allegations that a private company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders cut supply over a payment dispute.A total of 97 of the 1527 child deaths between [1 Jul-14 Aug 2017] were from the mosquitoborne Japanese encephalitis and AES, which is caused by other toxins, viruses and bacteria, among others.JE and AES deaths continue to account for roughly 2/3 of child deaths from all causes.Encephalitis is the swelling in the brain that leads to sudden high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and, finally, death.From [1 Jan-22 Aug 2017], the hospital recorded 625 AES admissions, of which 158 children died. More than 30 percent of the cases and deaths were reported during July and till mid August [2017].Of the 2729 child deaths from all causes in 2016, close to 45 per cent (1218) occurred when monsoon peaks between July and October.On 14 Aug [2017], 24 deaths occurred within a single day, when there were no disruptions of any kind.""On an average, there are between 10 and 20 deaths each day at this time of the year. AES has got very high mortality rate of around 30 percent and since this is a referral hospital, all the infants admitted in the neonatal wards are brought in when they are critical,"" said a senior administrative official, requesting anonymity.The newly-appointed principal, Dr PK Singh, says, ""We get very sick babies because most parents seek local remedies and treatment from quacks before they bring their children to the hospital. Add to it the load of sick newborns and pre-term babies and deaths go up.""""You might find 2-3 babies on one bed or 2 babies in one incubator but that's because we try not to turn anyone away. We provide the best of care possible under the given circumstances, which is not enough at times,"" said Dr Singh.""Since children are vaccinated against mosquito-borne JE, deaths have gone down. Most deaths are now from AES,"" said Dr Harish Tiwari, lecturer, department of community medicine, BRD.[byline: Rhythma Kaul]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The encephalitis situation in Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College hospital has been, and remains, confusing. As mentioned above, the deaths of 30 children are attributed to lack of supplementary oxygen. However, 97 of 1527 childhood deaths between 1 Jul-14 Aug 2017 are attributed to JE and AES, and since then 2/3 of childhood deaths are due to JE and AES. [These apparently contradictory statistics are being explained (rightly or wrongly) on the assumption that the 2/3 proportion refers to deaths since 14 Aug 2017. Clarification would be appreciated. - Mods.TY/SH]The report above also indicates that since children have been vaccinated against JE virus infections, deaths have gone down. The proportions of these deaths due to JE and to AES are not indicated. AES continues to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to define the causes of AES. Until the etiologies are known, prevention and effective treatment will not be possible.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and a <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1307>. - Mod.TY]
