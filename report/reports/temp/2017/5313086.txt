Alfedaa News [in Arabic, trans. Mod.MM, edited]<http://fedaa.alwehda.gov.sy/node/262209>The Director of the Communicable Diseases department, Hama governorate, has revealed that the number of registered human brucellosis cases has amounted to 420 from the beginning of this year [2017] and up to the end of August 2017. He also stressed the importance of following hygienic practices when dealing with the consumption of dairy products.--Communicated by:ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[As reported by Syria to the OIE, both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are endemic in the country.Further differentiation of the bacteria circulating in Syria has been reported in a 2016 paper (ref 1) as follows: _B. abortus_ (in large ruminants) - biovar 9. _B. melitensis_(in small ruminants) - biovars 1 and 3. The majority of human cases are caused by _B. melitensis_ biovars 1 and 3.Syria has reported to the OIE the following figures on human brucellosis for the years 2009-2015 (no report yet for 2016): 2009 (4872 human cases); 2010 (3520); 2011 (2860); 2012 (1452); 2013 (9723); 2014 (10 994); 2015 (10 112).The following comment by Mod.LL, related to the striking increase in the number of human cases during 2013 (see 20130816.1882350) is applicable: ""Brucellosis is endemic in much of the Middle East. Civil war-related erosion of programs for livestock health will certainly lead to increased brucellosis in the animals and subsequent spread to humans from direct livestock contact and/or ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products. Given the political situation in Syria, one wonders how the diagnosis of brucellosis in people was made.""With the seemingly stabilizing of the political/military situation in Syria, controlling zoonotic diseases which have dramatically spread during the years of fighting, such as brucellosis and leishmaniasis, will be one of the tasks requiring early attention.Reference---------I.
