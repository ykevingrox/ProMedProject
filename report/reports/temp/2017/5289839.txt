Athr News [in Arabic, trans. Mod.MM, edited]<http://www.athrnews.org/athr257473pp>Today, [Thu 31 Aug 2017] the General Directorate of Health-Jizan region tweeted regarding the detection of 4 cases of cholera among the expatriates with positive laboratory results. The tweet added that the necessary control measures for the above mentioned cases and their contacts have been undertaken.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As noted by my MENA colleague MM, in the above mentioned news wire it is not clear the country of origin of the affected expatriate cases (called wafideen in Arabic versus citizens). However, taking into account the close proximity of Jizan city to Yemen, one might assume these cases may have crossed the borders from Yemen as Jizan is one of the gates to pilgrims going for Hajj these days.Jizan Region (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizan_Region>) is the 2nd smallest (after Al Bahah) region of Saudi Arabia. It stretches 300 km [186.41 mi] along the southern Red Sea coast, just north of Yemen. It covers an area of 11 671 kmå  [4506.19 miå ] and has a population of 1 365 110 at the 2010 census (preliminary result). The region has the highest population density in the Kingdom. - Mod.LL]
