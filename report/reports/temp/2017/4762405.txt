The farmer presented to his district hospital, 4 days after abrupt onset of fever, headache and back pain. Gingival bleeding started the day prior to admission. He was referred to the secondary level referral hospital in Cape Town with a differential diagnosis of severe pancreatitis or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. With progressive gastrointestinal bleeding and ecchymoses, he was transferred to the tertiary referral hospital with supposed severe intra-abdominal sepsis and DIC [disseminated intravascular coagulation]. He entered the convalescent phase on day 9, and 5 days later, following a review of negative laboratory results, an informal consultation was made to the Infectious Diseases Department.Blood was immediately sent to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) for CCHF testing, where the diagnosis was confirmed; CCHF IgG IFA positive (titre of 1000), CCHF IgM IFA positive (titre of 100), CCHF PCR was weakly positive at a cycle threshold of 38. In retrospect, he remembered a small red tick firmly embedded in his leg 3 days prior to symptom onset. As of day 11 after cessation of bleeding, there have been no secondary cases.CCHF is transmitted by the _Hyalomma_, or bont-legged ['bont-poot'] ticks as they are known in South Africa that are widely distributed throughout the country. CCHF is most frequent in the drier, arid climates of the Northern Cape, Free State and North West Provinces, but cases may occur anywhere, including the Western Cape. On average, 5 cases of CCHF are recorded in South Africa each year, although none occurred in 2016.In common with infections occurring outside of endemic areas, CCHF is often characterized by diagnostic delay, putting health care workers at risk. All patients with an occupational exposure (farmer, veterinarian, abattoir worker etc) presenting with a febrile, bleeding illness in South Africa should be treated as a CCHF-suspect, and be discussed with an infectious diseases specialist at their referral centre or the NICD.--Professor Marc MendelsonHead of Infectious Diseases,University of Cape Town, South AfricaGroote Schuur Hospital<marc.mendelson@uct.ac.za>ProMed thanks Professor Marc Mendelson for his valuable contribution on the human case of CCHF from South Africa.[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus (Bunyaviridae: Nairovirus) is a medically important, endemic tick-borne pathogen in South Africa. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever cases occur sporadically in South Africa, with a yearly average of 5. Since the 1rst recorded case in 1981, 192 CCHF cases have been recorded in South Africa. [<www.nicd.ac.za/assets/files/Crimean-Congo%20update1.pdf>.]Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus is typically transmitted by the so-called ""bont poot"" ticks, Hyalomma rufipes and H. truncatum [<http://www.itg.be/photodatabase/African_ticks_files/index.html>].The Hyalomma species, and therefore CCHF virus, occur in the more arid parts of South Africa, particularly on the inland plateau. Ticks become infected by feeding on the blood of a viraemic vertebrate animal. Infection in these tick species is chronic and spans the lifetime of the vector, and ticks appear to be both vector and reservoir for these pathogens.Hyalomma ticks feed on a variety of domestic ruminants (sheep, goats, and cattle) as well as wild herbivores, hares, hedgehogs and certain rodents. Although CCHF virus infection in animals is generally subclinical, it generates viraemia levels capable of supporting virus transmission to uninfected ticks [<Swanepoel R, Paweska J. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. In: Oxford Textbook of Zoonoses: Biology, Clinical Practise and Public Health Control, Second Edition. Palmer S.R., Soulsby L., Torgerson P.R. & Brown D.W.G.,eds. Oxford University Press, UK, 2011: 287-293>]. Results from serological surveys conducted in Africa and Eurasia indicate extensive circulation of the virus in livestock and wild vertebrates [< Swanepoel R, Burt F. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. Second Edition. In: Infectious Diseases of Live-stock,Coetzer J.A.W, Tustin R.C., eds. Cape Town: Oxford University Press Southern Africa, 2004: 1077-1085>].Serological evidence of human infection with CCHF is uncommon, despite the widespread and high prevalence of CCHF virus antibodies amongst sheep, cattle and hares throughout South Africa. A serosurveillance study conducted in the 1980s found high antibody prevalence to CCHF virus in cattle herds in the interior of the country, with over 90 percent in some herds, while the seroprevallence was less than 4 percent in cattle in the coastal region between Cape Town and East London. Only 17/1109 (1.5 percent) of human residents on 55 farms had antibodies to CCHF, while no veterinary staff engaged in farm animal practice were CCHF sero-positive[Swanepoel R, Shepherd AJ, Leman PA, Shepherd SP. Investigations following initial recognition of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in South Africa and the diagnosis of 2 further cases. S Afr Med J 1985; 68: 638-641.]As reported in above case, the effected individual who worked with livestock in Western Cape province in South Africa showed evidence from positive Immunoflouresence and Elisa assay results. Relatively weaker positive PCR result is confirmatory of acute infection in this case. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/17195>.][See Also:2016----2014----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa ex Namibia 20140919.27887642013----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (03): (MP) farmer 20130709.1815602Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (02): background 20130116.1501273Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa: (FS) 20130115.14996752011----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa: (NAS) 20110101.00122008----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (02): (EAS) 20080726.2282Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa: (Eastern Cape) 20080716.21622006----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (Free State) (02) 20060121.0197Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (Free State) 20060119.01752005----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (Southern Cape) 20051011.29632004----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (North West) 20040201.03942002----Crimean-Congo hem. fever - South Africa (N.
