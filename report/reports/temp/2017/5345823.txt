The diagnosis of measles was confirmed by laboratory testing (serology, virus detection, or isolation) in 57 percent of these cases and by epidemiological link in 24 percent of the cases. The remaining 1181 cases (19 percent) were classified as clinically compatible. The identified genotypes were D8 (n=405), B3 (n=547), H1 (n=22), and D9 (n=1).Among the cases with known age group (n=9384), 3972 (42 percent) were 20 years and older, while 2024 (22 percent) were 1 to 4 years of age.With regard to vaccination status, among the cases with known vaccination history (n=7840), 84 percent were unvaccinated, while 17 percent were reportedly vaccinated with at least 1 measles-containing vaccine dose.Suboptimal vaccination coverage in many of these countries has favored the spread of measles.Countries in other continents (China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, and Viet Nam, among others) have also reported measles outbreaks between 2016 and 2017.Region of the Americas----------------------Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 37 of 2017 [1 Jan-15 Sep 2017], a total of 167 confirmed measles cases were reported in 3 countries of the Region of the Americas: Argentina (3 cases), Canada (45 cases), and the United States of America (119 cases). All confirmed cases were imported from other continents, related to importation, or had unknown source of infection. Of the confirmed cases, 36 percent are children between 1 and 4 years of age, followed by adults aged 20 -- 49 years (32 percent). Approximately 52 percent of the cases are female; and 60 percent were unvaccinated. The genotypes identified in these outbreaks are D8 in Argentina, and B3 and D8 in Canada and the United States.In addition, between EW 26 and EW 35 of 2017 [24 Jun-1 Sep 2017], a total of 84 suspected measles cases were reported in 10 parishes in the municipality of CaronÌ , BolÌ var state, Venezuela. Of the total, 34 cases were confirmed by laboratory testing, 42 are under investigation, and 8 were discarded. About 79 percent (n=27) of the confirmed cases are aged 9 years or younger.Sample cases are being sent to a WHO Collaborating Center for genetic characterization to determine the origin of the virus. The investigation is ongoing.The actions implemented by the public health authorities include:- identification and investigation of all suspected cases;- activation of the situation room at regional and national levels;- intensification of epidemiological surveillance and search of contacts in order to determine an effective epidemiological barrier;- collection of serum and nasopharyngeal swab samples from suspected cases;- mass indiscriminate vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) of those aged 6 months to 10 years and selective vaccination of contacts aged 11-39 years (depending on the age group of the affected population).The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) is supporting national authorities in implementing these actions. In addition, it is assisting with the training of institutional and community health personnel for the detection and investigation of suspected cases; and, facilitating the purchase of supplies, reagents, and vaccines to respond to the outbreak.The Region of the Americas was the first to be declared by the International Expert Committee (IEC) free of rubella in 2015 and measles in 2016. The main measure to prevent the introduction and dissemination of the measles virus is the vaccination of the susceptible population, together with the implementation of a surveillance system of high quality and sensitive enough to detect in a timely manner any suspected cases of measles or rubella.Given that measles and rubella viruses are still circulating in other continents, and that the arrival of international travelers to the Americas increased by 4 percent in 2016, the occurrence of cases in unvaccinated travelers is expected. ...--Communicated byKathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>******[2] AmericasDate: Mon 25 Sep 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-americas-mid-september-32582/>Measles in the Americas January-mid September 2017USA = 119 cases from 15 statesCanada = 45 cases (B3, D8)Argentina =3 cases (D8)Venezuela = 84 suspected cases Bolivar StateFrom the beginning of the year [2017] through mid-September, 167 confirmed measles cases have been reported from 3 countries.In the United States, 119 people from 15 states (California, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Washington) were reported to have measles.

""My son died within a week after falling sick after catching this viral [infection],""one father said. According to him, his son was treated at home while some of the deceased were taken to private clinics.""6 children are believed to have died of measles,"" said district health officer of Umerkot, Dr Karmoon Mal. He claimed that all the deceased children belonged to a gypsy tribe which often kept relocating. ""Owing to their constant relocation, their children may not have been immunised,"" he added.The villagers, however, said no immunisation team had visited their village. ""Our children have not been vaccinated for any viral [disease] for many years.""They demanded an inquiry into the outbreak to fix responsibility on the officials for neglecting the village.On [Mon 25 Sep 2017], health authorities set up a medical camp in the village where the children were diagnosed and immunised. Those with symptoms like sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, inflammation in eyes, and others were referred to civil hospital.[Byline: Z Ali]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://pakistanmap.facts.co/pakistanmapof/PakistanAdministrativeMap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/48117>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[4] Pakistan (Umerkot district, Sindh province)Date: Mon 25 Sep 2017Source: Dawn [edited]<https://www.dawn.com/news/1359968/10-children-dead-dozens-hospitalised-in-umerkot-measles-outbreak>At least 10 children have died, while dozens have been hospitalised in the past 2 weeks following a measles outbreak in the Mithoo gypsy colony near Kunri in Umerkot district [Sindh province].According to StJ, a famous classical flute player and snake charmer, 800 families live in the gypsy colony near village Sabhri, which has been affected by the measles outbreak that began around 2 weeks ago.He said that the community has been living under extreme poverty and unhygienic conditions with lack of drinking water and health facilities, especially routine vaccination.KJ informed Dawn that his son had contracted a high fever with a dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) and tiny white spots with bluish-white centres on a red background inside the mouth and on the inner lining of the cheek. He died within a week, KJ said.LJ told Dawn that his son and 35 other neighbours had been hospitalised so far. He said that the community's men are poor labourers who visit different areas of Pakistan for work while the women and children stay in the colony. But they have never been visited by a vaccinator for routine immunisation, resulting in the loss of young lives.SjJ said they have tried traditional methods of healing by burning donkey dung and spent a lot of money at private clinics but failed to save their dying children.While confirming that the disease affecting the children was measles, District Health Officer (DHO) Umerkot Karmoon Mal claimed that whenever vaccinators visited the colony, the gypsies would not be present as they migrate in search of livelihood.LS, a primary teacher in the village, ruled out the DHO Umerkot's version, stressing that only males leave the colony to labour, begging or amusing people with snakes and flutes, but children are enrolled at schools and therefore live with women and the elders in the colony.The government is yet to take action on the matter.[Byline: Allah Bux Arisar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur George A Robertson[ProMED thanks George Robertson (PATH) for submitting this dire report on the measles outbreak in the Mithoo gypsy colony in Umerkot district, Pakistan. Whether the families in this colony were overlooked during vaccination campaigns, or whether their itinerant lifestyle prevents children from being vaccinated, it is critical to the health of the community that this is immediately corrected and vaccination of the gypsies take place. - Mod.LK]******Africa---[5] Uganda (Kampala and Wakiso district)Date: Tue 26 Sep 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/uganda-measles-outbreak-tops-550-cases-since-april-44668/>In a follow-up to a report on the measles outbreak in Uganda, UN health officials say the country has reported 552 and 1 death since the outbreak was declared 8 Apr 2017.The case breakdown shows 309 cases from Kampala and 243 from Wakiso, with mostly young children being affected. 3/4 of the confirmed cases were unvaccinated.The Ministry of Health has developed a measles response plan, which includes strengthening case management and case-based surveillance; reducing the numbers of measles-susceptible children and interrupting transmission by strengthening routine immunization services; ensuring a smooth flow of public information and effective social mobilization for appropriate community response behavior; and effective coordination of epidemic response activities.A total of 392 vaccination outreach activities have been planned in the 5 divisions of Kampala. Kawempe, Rubaga, Nakawa, and Makindye divisions will each conduct 80 outreaches while Central division will undertake 72 outreaches. So far, 3053 children have been immunized in Makindye and 2766 children in Central division.Periodic Intensified Routine Immunizations (PIRI) is being implemented in all 5 divisions of Kampala and all sub-counties of Wakiso district over a 3-month period, and never-vaccinated children will be identified and vaccinated.WHO says the current measles outbreak highlights the vulnerability of the poor urban populations, particularly under the prevailing economic constraints. Efforts are needed to achieve and sustain at least 95 percent coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) to control and prevent future outbreaks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is hoped that the Periodic Intensified Routine Immunization program is successful and increases vaccination coverage in these populations beyond the current estimate of 25 percent. That is strikingly low and will do little to protect the community.Maps of Uganda can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97> - Mod.LK]
