The collection of 38 blood samples from individuals in some communities suggests that there is a suspicion that YF virus may be circulating in an area wider than the Oro Ago area. Although the report indicates that mosquitoes are common in the area, the critical question is whether _Aedes aegypti_, the common vector of YF virus, is abundant there. With this 2nd case, and perhaps more, intensified surveillance and a targeted vaccination campaign are urgent. Treatment of the 2 cases is urgent also. However, it is too late for vaccination of these 2 individuals -- they are already infected. One hopes that fake YF vaccination cards have not been sold in this area, providing a false sense of protection.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63144>. - Mod.TY]
