Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-cholera-who-idUSKBN1A61GY>Yemen's cholera outbreak is far from being controlled and may be further exacerbated by the rainy season, even if the rate of new cases appears to be slowing in some hotspots, the WHO said on Fri 21 Jul 2017.Oxfam projected the number could rise to more than 600 000 cases, ""the largest ever recorded in any country in a single year since records began"", exceeding Haiti in 2011. Nigel Timmins, the charity's humanitarian director who has just returned from the country, said: ""Cholera has spread unchecked in a country already on its knees after 2 years of war and which is teetering on the brink of famine. For many people, weakened by war and hunger, cholera is the knockout blow.""The WHO reported 368 207 suspected cases and 1828 deaths in the Arabian Peninsula country since late April 2017. ""Every day we have 5000 more Yemenis falling sick with symptoms of acute watery diarrhea or cholera,"" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing in Geneva. ""Yemen's cholera outbreak is far from being controlled, the rainy season has just started and may increase the paths of transmission. Sustained efforts are required to stop the spread of this disease,"" she said.Millions are malnourished in Yemen where famine looms, the UN says. A Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels and fighting limits access for aid workers.Surveillance data ""confirms a slight decline in suspected cases over the past 2 weeks"" in some of the most affected governorates -- Amanat Al Asimah, Amran, and Sana'a, Chaib said. But great caution was called for as there is a backlog in reporting and data is still being analyzed, she said.Oxfam, which is based in Britain, said Yemen's rainy season from July to September would increase the risk of the disease spreading further through water contaminated with faeces. ""It is feared that the total number of people infected could eventually rise to over 600 000, making it one of the largest outbreaks since records began in 1949,"" Oxfam said.The WHO did not provide its latest planning figure.""The fighting is hugely exacerbating the ability to stop this epidemic of cholera. The kind of disintegration of the health system in Yemen as a result of the conflict at a time of cholera is an absolutely lethal combination,"" UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told Friday's [21 Jul 2017] briefing.[Byline: Stephanie Nebehay]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the dreadfully impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 53202 Jun / 73 700 / 60504 Jun / 86 400 / 67605 Jun / 91 400 / 72806 Jun / 96 000 / 74607 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 150004 Jul / 275 987 / 163407 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 1828In the last complete year of data (2015; <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>), WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
