""The patient was admitted after he began to have paralysis of cranial nerves; neurologists and infectious disease doctors were consulted, who immediately suspected botulism. The patient was transferred to the Institute Victor Babes,"" she said.The Sanitary, Veterinary, and Food Safety Authority (DSVSA) of Buzau has started an investigation into this case. Inspectors went to Patarlagele, where samples of canned food similar to that consumed by [the patient were taken].""The store told us that they had in stock only 6 such cans; 2 had been purchased, one by the man who was ill and another by another resident, who contracted the disease. Three cans left in the shop were sealed, and another was sent to Bucharest for laboratory analysis,"" said Dr. Marijean Milea, from DSVSA Buzau.Buzau had had no cases of botulism for more than 6 years.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It should be noted that in typical foodborne botulism, the toxin is pre-formed in the food when ingested. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult equivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) is caused by ingestion of spores, which germinate, and toxin is formed _in situ_. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>.]
