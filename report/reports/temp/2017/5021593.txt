The Times [edited]<https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/isis-hacker-who-hid-terror-files-on-cufflinks-is-jailed-t8008sqph>An Islamic State ""librarian"", who stashed files on memory cards hidden in cuff links, has been jailed for 8 years after an international operation traced his links to an alleged anthrax plot in Kenya. Ullah, a self-radicalised hacker from Cardiff, trained jihadists in encryption techniques and compiled a library that included information on missile guidance systems and biological weapons such as anthrax.Samata Ullah was part of a group of Isis hackers calling themselves the ""cyber caliphate army."" Ullah, 34, was tracked down to his bedroom in Cardiff after the arrest of a contact in Kenya who was allegedly planning an anthrax attack.When police raided Ullah's flat they found a memory card containing the academic textbook ""Beyond Anthrax: The Weaponization of Infectious Diseases"". It was not intended for use by terrorists.[Byline: John Simpson, Duncan Gardham]--Communicated by:Ross Getman<ross_getman@verizon.net>[""Beyond Anthrax"" is a medical response text for those who might be faced with a bioterrorist event. The 1st edition actually missed the necessary detailed information on anthrax; as & when it is published, the 2nd edition has such a chapter.The reality of the true intents and capabilities of the Kenyan ""bioterrorists"" was not clear from the reports out of Nairobi but it is certain that their cyber security was poor. Thus, this and other arrests. Plus the Kenyan security people admirably informed their UK colleagues of the risks posed by this person in Wales. That he was arrested in his bedroom suggests that he is a university student at Cardiff University living in lodgings. The Kenyan plotters were medical interns.With thanks to Ross for forwarding this report. - Mod.MHJOur own bacterial diseases moderator, Larry Lutwick (Mod.LL), was the editor of this volume. It was meant as a clinical primer for ID and microbiology people to learn about the BT diseases. It is certainly not a cookbook for BT. - Mod.LMA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/281>.]
