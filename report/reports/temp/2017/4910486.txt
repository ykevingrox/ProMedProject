Epidemiological Update, Yellow Fever [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=38672&lang=en%3ehttp://www.paho.org/hq>Since epidemiological week (EW) 1 to EW 9 of 2017, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.The following is a summary of the situation in Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname.In Brazil, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016 to 13 Mar 2017, there were 1538 cases of yellow fever reported (396 confirmed, 184 discarded, and 958 suspected cases remain under investigation), including 255 deaths (134 confirmed, 9 discarded, and 112 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 34 percent among confirmed cases and 12 percent among suspected cases.According to the probable site of infection, 79 percent of the suspected and confirmed cases were reported in the state of Minas Gerais (1070 [cases]), followed by EspÌ rito Santo (245), SÌ£o Paulo (15), Bahia (9), Tocantins (6), GoÌ as (3), and Rio Grande do Norte (1). The confirmed cases are distributed in 3 states: Minas Gerais (303), EspÌ rito Santo (89), and SÌ£o Paulo.Figure 1 [map] illustrates the municipalities with confirmed cases and cases under investigation, as well as confirmed epizootics and epizootics under investigation.In the state of Minas Gerais, the downward trend in suspected and confirmed cases continues to decline for the 5th consecutive week. In the state of EspÌ rito Santo, there has been a downward trend in cases as of EW 5 of 2017; it will be necessary to continue to observe the evolution of the epidemic.Figure 2 [graph] illustrates the trend of confirmed yellow fever cases by probable place of infection.With regard to the number of new cases (confirmed and under investigation) reported between 13 Feb-13 Mar [2017], there were 125 new cases in EspÌ rito Santo, and in Minas Gerais during the same period, there were 108 new cases reported. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of confirmed, suspected and discarded cases in the state of EspÌ rito Santo.There is possibility of a change in the yellow fever transmission cycle in this current outbreak; however, to date, _Aedes aegypti_ has not been reported to have a role in transmission. Confirmed cases have been reported in municipalities near large urban areas in the states of EspÌ rito Santo and Minas Gerais; this combined with the confirmation of epizootics and notification of suspected cases in the municipality of Vitoria, EspÌ rito Santo represent a high risk for a change in the transmission cycle [from sylvan to urban. - Mod.TY].With regard to the confirmed fatal cases and their probable site of infection, 111 were in the state of Minas Gerais, 3 in the state of SÌ£o Paulo, and 20 in the state of EspÌ rito Santo. In decreasing order, the CFR among suspected and confirmed cases by state is 75 percent in SÌ£o Paulo, 37 percent in Minas Gerais, and 22 percent in EspÌ rito Santo.Figure 1 [maps].

No new epizootics have been confirmed during this period. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 1228 NHP epizootics were reported, of which 386 were yellow fever confirmed, and 11 were discarded.Epizootics in NHP were reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Bahia, GoiÌÁs, EspÌ rito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, ParÌÁ, ParaÌ ba, ParanÌÁ, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, RondÌ«nia, Santa Catarina, SÌ£o Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins.Reports of epizootics are currently under investigation in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul (bordering Bolivia and Paraguay), Santa Catarina (bordering Argentina), Rio Grande do Sul (bordering Uruguay and Argentina), RondÌ«nia (bordering Bolivia), ParÌÁ (bodering Guyana and Suriname), and ParanÌÁ (bordering Argentina and Paraguay); this represents a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.In Ecuador, in EW 10 of 2017, the IHR National Focal Point of Ecuador reported a confirmed case of yellow fever to PAHO/WHO; the case is a 31-year-old male patient in the province of Sucumbios, which borders Colombia. The case was confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Prior to this case, the last confirmed yellow fever case in Ecuador was reported in 2012 in the province of Napo.In Peru, up to EW 9 of 2017, a total of 7 confirmed and probable cases of yellow fever had been reported, including 2 deaths. The Ayacucho department reported 3 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the Sivia and Santa Rosa districts, including one death in the Santa Rosa district. The remaining 4 cases were reported as probable cases by the departments of Amazonas (2), Pasco (1), and San Martin.Figure 4 illustrates the number of probable and confirmed yellow fever cases reported between 2000 and 2017 in Peru.Figure 4 [graph]. Probable and confirmed yellow fever cases in Peru by reported year, 2000-2007.In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in EW 6 of 2017, the IHR National Focal Point of Bolivia reported a case of yellow fever with a positive IgM by ELISA technique result to PAHO/WHO. The case is a 28-year-old, unvaccinated male tourist who arrived in Bolivia on 8 Jan 2017 and went to the municipality of Caranavi on 9 Jan [2017], where he likely acquired the infection.Yellow fever in Bolivia is endemic and has occurred cyclically with outbreaks of varying magnitudes up to 2012. As of 2013, only isolated cases have been reported.In Suriname, in EW 10 of 2017, a laboratory confirmed case of yellow fever was reported in a traveler from the Netherlands who had not been vaccinated for yellow fever and had remained in Suriname from mid-February to early-March 2017. The case was confirmed by the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam via RT-PCR and sequencing, as well as by RT-PCR by the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Germany [see report below].Suriname had not reported yellow fever cases since 1972.Recommendations:Given the current yellow fever situation in Brazil and the emergence of cases in areas where cases have not been detected in several years, the Pan American Health Organization Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges Member States to continue efforts to detect, confirm, and adequately and timely treat cases of yellow fever. To this end, health care workers should be kept up to date and trained to detect and treat cases, especially in areas of known virus circulation.PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to take the necessary actions to keep travelers heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is mandatory informed and vaccinated.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[This report indicates that the numbers of new cases in states in Brazil continue to decline but does not contain the new information about cases in Rio de Janeiro state, showing that the outbreak continues to spread geographically in that country. Reports from the other countries mentioned illustrate the more usual situation of sporadic cases of spill-over of sylvan transmission to humans. Fortunately, so far, there is no report of _Aedes aegypti_ transmission in an urban cycle. One hopes that the proactive vaccination campaign in Brazil now has provided sufficient coverage of the population to preclude it. - Mod.TY]******[2] Casimiro de Abreu, Rio de Janeiro stateDate: Sat 18 Mar 2017Source: AP Big Story [edited]<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bcb5a77179874319a8c53d1e84a384a2/small-brazil-city-edge-after-man-dies-yellow-fever>This small city in the state of Rio de Janeiro is on high alert after authorities confirmed the death of one man by yellow fever and said they were investigating several other possible cases.Health authorities this week confirmed that a 38-year-old man died from the illness on 11 Mar [2017].A neighbor of the man was infected and sent for treatment to a hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro, where he is recovering.Authorities are investigating possible cases involving 4 relatives of the man, including a 13-year-old and a 9-year-old.In the city center and rural areas of Casimiro de Abreu, about 93 miles (150 km) from Rio de Janeiro [city], a large tent has been set up to vaccinate people. Authorities say around 30 000 of the city's 42 000 people have been vaccinated in recent days.""I'm really scared,"" said a mother of 2 who arrived Friday [17 Mar 2017] to get vaccinated. ""If adults can't deal with the illness, imagine the children.""Yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitos and causes fever, body aches, vomiting and sometimes jaundice. Rio de Janeiro's state Health Department has announced plans to vaccinate its entire population as a preventative measure. It says it will need 12 million doses to reach a 90 percent vaccination rate by year's [2017] end.The vaccinations come as cases continue to be confirmed in several areas nationwide. Brazil's Health Ministry says that at least 424 people have been infected with yellow fever in the largest outbreak the country has seen in years.Of those, 137 have died, and more than 900 other cases are under investigation. The vast majority of confirmed cases and deaths have been in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, which borders the state of Rio de Janeiro.In Casimiro de Abreu, health workers visited houses in rural areas and inspected stagnant water, where mosquitoes lay eggs. The state also sent experts to nearby parks and reserves with monkey populations to monitor the situation with the primates, which are a primary reservoir of yellow fever.Meanwhile, in a group of houses near a lush jungle area a few miles (5 km) from downtown, relatives of the fatal case wait for news about the 4 members of the family who may be infected.The younger brother of the man who died said he took solace in knowing that the death raised alarm bells that could save others.""Wherever he is now, he knows that because he died a lot of lives were saved,"" he said.[Byline: Yesica Fisch]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The appearance of new yellow fever (YF) cases in Rio de Janeiro state for the 1st time during the current outbreak is worrisome. Although the incidence of YF cases in other states appears to be in decline, expansion into new areas is of concern. The deaths of monkeys, some of species of which are in danger of extinction in the Atlantic forest, remain a concern as well.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TY]******[3] Netherlands ex SurinameDate: Thu 16 Mar 2017Source: Euro Surveill. 2017;22(11):pii=30488.

Yellow fever in a traveller returning from Suriname to the Netherlands, March 2017.[Abstract]A Dutch traveller returning from Suriname in early March 2017 presented with fever and severe acute liver injury. Yellow fever was diagnosed by (q)RT-PCR and sequencing. During hospital stay, the patient's condition deteriorated, and she developed hepatic encephalopathy requiring transfer to intensive care. Although yellow fever has not been reported in the last 4 decades in Suriname, vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization for visitors to this country.[The case]In March 2017, a Dutch Caucasian female in her late 20s from the Netherlands was referred to the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands because of high fever and signs of severe acute liver injury after returning from a 2-week stay in Suriname.[Discussion]Although Suriname is considered to be endemic for yellow fever virus [YFV], no human cases have been officially reported since 1971. With a population of ca. 570 000 people, Suriname has a YFV vaccination coverage of 80-85 percent in infants. Although WHO recommends vaccination for travellers to countries with risk of YFV transmission like Suriname, sporadic cases of imported yellow fever in returning travellers have been reported, for example, in Europe, the United States and Asia, with 3 reported cases related to the ongoing YFV outbreaks in South America in European travellers since 2016.However, despite the presence of competent _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes in France and _Ae. aegypti_ in Madeira, the risk for YFV transmission in Europe is currently considered to be very low due to the lack of vector activity.[Conclusion]Clinicians in non-endemic countries should be aware of yellow fever in travellers presenting with fever, jaundice and/or haemorrhage returning from South America, including Suriname. This case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for YFV vaccination, even for countries with risk of YFV transmission that have not reported cases for decades.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The conclusion stating that individuals traveling to yellow fever (YF) endemic countries should be vaccinated is important. The absence of human cases does not mean that the virus is not circulating in the forest transmission cycle, as this young woman from the Netherlands regretfully found out. This case should serve as a warning, not only for travelers but for their health authorities in countries not endemic for YF virus where _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present, and the risk of initiation of an urban outbreak is real.A map showing the location of Suriname in northeastern South America can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37>. - Mod.TY]
