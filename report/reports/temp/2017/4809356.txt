The Rio Times [edited]<http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-politics/minas-gerais-state-in-brazil-confirms-109-cases-of-yellow-fever/>The number of confirmed cases of yellow fever in Minas Gerais rose to 109, according to an epidemiological bulletin released earlier this week by the State Health Department.The total number of confirmed yellow fever deaths in Minas Gerais is 40. One of the victims was probably infected in the northern municipality of JanuÌÁria, but was diagnosed and died in the Federal District.The state reported 712 reports of suspected yellow fever in 51 counties. In addition to the 109 confirmed cases, 19 cases were discarded while others are still under analysis. Also being investigated are 70 deaths that may have been caused by yellow fever.So far there have been no confirmed cases reported in Rio de Janeiro, but Dr Pedro Junqueira who practices internal medicine in the city told The Rio Times, ""We have to recognize [yellow fever] is not part of most doctors daily cases in Rio de Janeiro, where most people are not immunized -- either through vaccination or previous contact.""He adds, ""Unexpected urban outbreaks have been seen before in other Latin American cities. Therefore, I feel the medical community should really be concerned about a possible yellow fever outbreak in Rio very soon and start a task force in order to minimize the transmission and improve the early recognition and treatment of patients.""SÌ£o Paulo and EspÌ rito Santo also have yellow fever deaths, with 3 cases and one case, respectively. [The Health Department of SÌ£o Paulo on Mon 30 Jan 2017 said it has now confirmed 6 cases of the disease, 4 of whom became infected in Minas Gerais. All of the patients died. A 31 Jan 2017 report indicated that so far, 400 monkeys have been found dead in the state of EspÌ rito Santo where the fever outbreak has spread from neighboring Minas Gerais. See ProMED-mail archive no. 20170201.4806487]. This is already the largest outbreak of yellow fever in Brazil since 1980, when the Ministry of Health began to provide data from the historical series. Until now, the year with the most serious outbreak was 2000, with 85 confirmed cases and 40 deaths.Government news sources report that so far, 3.33 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed throughout the state of Minas Gerais and 1.55 million people have been vaccinated, most in the counties affected by the outbreak. In these cities, the hours of operation of the health units for vaccination were expanded and includes weekends.[Byline: Jay Forte]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of yellow fever cases in Minas Gerais continues to slowly increase. There is still no mention of person-to-person transmission via _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in an urban cycle. Presumably all cases are spill-over from a sylvan (forest) cycle involving monkeys. As Dr Pedro Junqueira mentioned above, ""Unexpected urban outbreaks have been seen before in other Latin American cities. Therefore, I feel the medical community should really be concerned about a possible yellow fever outbreak in Rio very soon and start a task force in order to minimize the transmission and improve the early recognition and treatment of patients."" This advice applies to the other states where cases of yellow fever have occurred , especially in Minas Gerais. Preparation is prudent and urgent.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4517>. - Mod.TY]
