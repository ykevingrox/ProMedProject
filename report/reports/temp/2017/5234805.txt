None of them was diagnosed as Dobrava with PCR for Dobrava serotype [virus]. Both cases were IgM and IgG positive for hantaviruses with ELISA. The case coming from Macedonia was doing seasonal work in a Macedonian village. Spas are near Debar in Macedonia and very near to the Albanian border and [the patient] had no contacts with the cases recently diagnosed in Macedonia and also had not been in the Gostivar [Macedonia] area.The case coming from Greece has to be verified because he is coming from an area known for HFRS in Albania and the incubation period cannot exactly fall within his time in Greece, in the Veria area near Thessaloniki.During a study conducted by Rogozi and myself, published in J Med Virol. 2016; 88(8): 1309-13; doi:10.1002/jmv.24486. Epub 2016 Feb 8 [<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27249068>] on genetic detection of hantaviruses in rodents in Albania, Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) was detected in 10 of 148 (6.7 percent) _Apodemus flavicollis_ rodents. DOBV-positive _A. flavicollis_ were detected in 6 districts (Diber, Korce, Kolonje, Librazhd, Pogradec, and Vlore). Among those districts was that of Diber, very near the Macedonian border, and the place where the recent patient might have been infected. Also among them is the district for the 2nd patient that we cannot verify and cannot say is imported from Greece.--Dr Silvia BinoHead of Control of Infectious Diseases DepartmentInstitute of Public HealthTiranaAlbania<silviabino@gmail.com>[Dr Silvia Bino is thanked for sending in this report and for the reference providing evidence of Dobrava-Belgrade virus in rodents in several districts in Albania. The virus is doubtless endemic there, and poses a public health risk for individuals in contact with these rodents and their habitats.As noted in the previous post, these are the 1st reports of hantavirus infections in Macedonia that ProMED-mail has posted. There is also evidence of HFRS in Greece, although ProMED-mail has not posted reports previously.Seroepidemiological investigations conducted in several Balkan countries revealed an overall seroprevalence of 4 percent in Greece (<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213004887#>). There doubtless have been Dobrava-Belgrade virus infections in Greece and the Balkans over the years, given that this virus is known to circulate widely in the Balkans.The yellow-necked field mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_) is the principle vertebrate host for Dobrava-Belgrade virus. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/72>.][See Also:Hantavirus - Europe (04): Albania 20170806.5230949Hantavirus - Europe (03): Macedonia (GT) 20170802.5221702Hantavirus - Europe (02): Germany (BW) 20170611.50987352013---Hantavirus update - Europe (02): Germany 20130725.18458252012---Hantavirus update 2012 - Europe (02): Ireland ex Germany 20120805.1229333Hantavirus update 2012 - Europe: Germany, Slovenia 20120525.1144830].................................................jh/ty/mj/jh"
