This cluster is not linked to the cluster of MERS that was previously reported in Al Jawf in the Disease Outbreak News posted on [Thu 17 Aug 2017]. In this new cluster, the 6 cases are among 17 household contacts who were being followed up by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health.Globally, 2079 laboratory-confirmed cases with MERS-CoV, including at least 722 related deaths have been reported to WHO.Public health responseThe source of infection of this cluster is under investigation by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has identified and is following up health care workers and household contacts of known MERS patients. As per Saudi Arabian policy, listed contacts are not allowed to attend Hajj.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[As per the above update, there have now been 2079 laboratory confirmed cases/infection with MERS-CoV reported to the WHO including at least 722 related deaths (reported case fatality rate: 34.7 percent).Additional outcome information available for some of the above mentioned cases includes: case No.2 reported as a fatality on [Thu 31 Aug 2017], and cases Nos. 4, 6, 7 and 9 were reported as recoveries on 6 Sep 2017, 31 Aug 2017, 1 Sep 2017 and 1 Sep 2017 respectively.The above report also confirms a 2nd cluster of cases in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region) all associated with household contacts. It does appear that since Saudi Arabia changed its contact tracing/testing policy to include all individuals with known contact with a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection,, irrespective of clinical status/illness (including asymptomatic individuals) there have been more and larger clusters of cases identified.  So, either the virus is changing and now producing more asymptomatic infections, or, there have always been many more asymptomatic infections that were missed because they did not meet the clinical criteria for testing.
