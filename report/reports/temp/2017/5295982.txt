BBC News [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41161133>A 4-year-old Italian girl has died of cerebral malaria in northern Italy, a region free of the disease, in what doctors see as a very mysterious case. [The girl] died in Brescia [Lombardy] on Sunday night [3 Sep 2017], after being rushed to hospital with a high fever on Saturday [2 Sep 2017].A flight could have brought it in. [The girl] had been on holiday with her parents at Bibione, an Adriatic resort near Venice.Trento [Trentino-Alto Adige], where the girl's malaria was diagnosed on [Sat 2 Sep 2017], lies within the Trentino region in the foothills of the Alps. ""It's the 1st time in my 30-year career that I've seen a case of malaria originating in Trentino,"" said Dr Claudio Paternoster, an infectious diseases specialist at Trento's Santa Chiara Hospital.Since the 1950s, Italy has not had a malaria problem because mosquito-infested marshes were drained.There is speculation that [the girl] might have caught malaria from one of 2 children treated for it at the Trento hospital after [15 Aug 2017]. They had caught it in Africa, and recovered.[The girl] had had treatment there for child diabetes and there was a break before her emergency readmission to the hospital at the weekend [2-3 Sep 2017].A Trentino health official, Paolo Bordon, said [the girl] had not been in the same ward as the other 2 children. [She] had not had a blood transfusion, he added, stressing that the treatments for malaria and diabetes were utterly different. The _Plasmodium falciparum_ parasite carried by the _Anopheles_ mosquito can kill a human within 24 hours.About 438 000 people died of malaria in 2015 in the 95 tropical countries where it is endemic, Italy's Corriere della Sera daily reports. Only some types of mosquito are able to transmit the disease from person to person [see comment below].Risky insects are found in large areas of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, the South Pacific, and some parts of Eastern Europe, but not in the rest of Europe [see comment below]..As a result, malaria is largely limited to tropical areas -- cases appearing within the European Union are typically ""suitcase"" ones, linked to recent travel to other parts of the world where malaria is present. The latest case in northern Italy has baffled experts. It is not clear how the girl caught it, but her case is not unique.The European Centre for Disease Prevention Control closely monitors cases and has found a few cases of ""locally acquired"" malaria in the EU -- 2 in France and 3 in Spain in 2014.But there were explanations for how some of these might have occurred. One was a patient who had received a kidney from a donor with malaria; another was a newborn whose mother had recently returned from Equatorial Guinea.One of the Spanish patients had no history of travel, but lived a few kilometres from a town where a ""suitcase"" malaria person lived. No infected local mosquitoes were found, but lab tests showed 2 people had an identical strain of the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-MBDS from HealthMap Alerts<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[Malaria is transmitted between humans by mosquitoes, blood transfusion, or organ transplants. Infected mosquitoes can travel in airplanes and infect people living close to an international airport.Italy was declared free of malaria in 1962. This means that no more human cases due to sustained transmission by mosquitoes infected in Italy took place. However, the mosquitoes able to transmit malaria are still there, and it is not correct -- as stated in the press text -- that mosquitoes able to transmit malaria are not present in Europe. Indeed they are -- as also seen from the list below of malaria acquired in Europe without the patient having travelled. The most spectacular outbreak was in Greece in 2011 and 2012 most probably initiated by infected migrant workers, who infected the local mosquitoes.In this case it is speculated that the 2 girls admitted at the same hospital with _P. falciparum_ malaria were the source of infection. That is indeed possible if the 2 girls infected the mosquitoes and the parasite developed and matured in the mosquitoes, which then bit the girl who later died. For _P. falciparum_ it would require an average 24-hour temperature above 20 deg C (68 deg F) during the time it takes for the parasite to mature in the mosquito, usually 7-10 days. Indeed, Italy experienced a heat wave in August [2017].To prevent transmission from _P. falciparum_ cases, the WHO recommends that the treatment be completed with a single dose of primaquine, to kill the gametocytes, the stage of parasites which infect the mosquitoes.This case illustrates that malaria should be included in the differential diagnosis of severely ill, febrile patients, even without a travel history. - Mod.EP][ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on the results of additional studies/investigations as to the probable origin of this infection.  Genetic studies on the identified organisms from the 3 malarial cases (this current case and the 2 previous cases identified in the Trento hospital) would be helpful as well as a more detailed itinerary for travel. Clarification of the geography involved would also be helpful.  The media report mentions the child was previously hospitalized in Trento, and malaria was diagnosed with malaria in Trento but the death occurred in Brescia (Brescia is located in Lombardy -- see map at <https://www.roughguides.com/maps/europe/italy/> -- Lombardy is region 5, Trentino region 4,  and Bibione, Venice region 6).The HealthMap/ProMED map of Italy can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>. - Mod.MPP]
