There is no discussion of symptoms but since gastroenteritis is suspected, the symptoms probably include watery diarrhea and vomiting, but may also have included stomach pain, cramping, fever, nausea, and headache. Because of diarrhea and vomiting, children can quickly become dehydrated.Gastroenteritis can be caused by contact with someone who has the virus, contaminated food or water, unwashed hands after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper.The most common cause of gastroenteritis is viral, the main types being rotavirus and norovirus. Rotavirus is the world's most common cause of diarrhea in infants and young children. Norovirus is the most common cause of serious gastroenteritis and also foodborne disease outbreaks in the U.S.Although not as common, bacteria such as _E. coli_ and salmonella can also trigger gastroenteritis. Salmonella and campylobacter bacteria are the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and are usually spread by undercooked poultry, eggs, or poultry juices. Salmonella can also be spread through pet reptiles or live poultry.
