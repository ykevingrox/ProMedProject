Macedonian Information Agency [edited]<http://www.mia.mk/en/Inside/RenderSingleNews/61/133795154>Test results from 2 labs have identified the hantavirus as a cause of death of a father and son from Simnica village near Grostivar, health minister Arbin Taravari said on Thursday [27 Jul 2017].Hantaan virus infection in humans can result in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Fortunately, the identified virus is one of the least harmful types, namely, it doesn't transfer from person to person but only through contact with rodent urine, saliva and feces.The Ministry of Health and the Commission of Infectious Diseases have been monitoring the developments and taking all necessary measures, Taravari said via video link, as he is paying a working visit to the United States. He denied claims that another person died of hantavirus infection, saying that 7 patients from Gostivar who have been in touch with the deceased, are in good health.Since the onset of this year [2017], 4 people with Hantaan virus infection have been admitted to Skopje Clinic for Infectious Diseases, and all of them are cured, Taravari said.Earlier today [27 Jul 2017], deputy health minister Goce Cakarovski said another 3 persons from the Gostivar village of Simnica had been admitted at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases with high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. ""Four other people having the same symptoms are also being treated at the clinic but are not in a life-threatening condition,"" Cakarovski said.--communicated by:Jas' Mantero<jasmantero@hotmail.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Jas' Mantero for this report and for the one below.This is a follow up to the earlier report of an undiagnosed illness involving the 2 cases in the Gostivar village of Simnica. Now, there is a diagnosis of a hantavirus infection. However, the above report indicates that Haantan virus is the hantavirus responsible for these cases. The virus responsible more likely is Dobrava-Belgrade virus.A map of Macedonia that shows the location of Gostivar can be found at <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Simnitsa,+Macedonia>. - Mod.

Alemka Markotiàb. HFRS and hantaviruses in the Balkans/South-East Europe.Highlights- The article represents a comprehensive review on HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome] in the Balkans with description of epidemic outbreaks in the last 50 years.- The incidence of Balkan HFRS is modest with hundreds of cases reported yearly.- Diverse rodent and insectivore species harbor several pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses, but only Dobrava and Puumala viruses are associated with disease in humans.- The clinical picture of the disease ranges from mild to a severe form with an overall mortality rate of 9.8 per cent among DOBV-infected patients.AbstractHemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is endemic in the Balkans with epidemic outbreaks and sporadic cases that have been recorded yearly since the disease was 1st recognized. The incidence of Balkan HFRS is modest, with approximately 100 cases reported in most years. Seroepidemiological investigations conducted in several Balkan countries revealed an overall seroprevalence of 6 per cent in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1.6 per cent in Croatia, 4 per cent in Greece and 1.7 per cent in Slovenia, respectively. The complex ecology of the Balkan Peninsula supports the existence of diverse rodent and insectivore species which harbor several pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses. Among them only Dobrava (DOBV) and Puumala (PUUV) viruses are associated with disease in humans. Comprehensive clinical studies compared clinical signs and symptoms between patients infected with either virus. A spectrum of clinical picture of the disease ranges from mild illness typical of PUUV infections to a severe form with fulminant hemorrhagic fever and an overall mortality rate of 9.8 per cent among DOBV infected patients. While severe DOBV cases are recognized from Slovenia in the North to Greece in the South, PUUV infections are more frequent in northern part of the area. Balkans represent an area with a potential need for hantavirus vaccines, but due to co-existence of DOBV and PUUV causing HFRS in the same region, a universal vaccine is required.3. Epidemiology3.1. ... Macedonia.The 1st report of an HFRS case in the Republic of Macedonia dates to 1987. In a 3-year period, from 1987 to 1990, at least 10 DOBV cases were diagnosed, with a 10 per cent mortality rate
