El Universal [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]<http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/caracas/fallece-cuarto-nino-infectado-unidad-hemodialisis-del-los-rios_658662>The NGO Prepara Familia, which supports mothers and patients of Children's Hospital J.M. of los RÌ os, reported that on [Sun 25 Jun 2017] night, a two year old [boy] died in intensive care, the 4th child infected in the hemodialysis unit of this pediatric center.The first was a 10 year-old, who died on[3 May 2017] and was contaminated with _Klebsiella_ germ. In less than 8 days, a 12 [year-old] died and on [22 May 2017], a 16-year-old boy.Prepara Familia and Codevida emphasize that the hemodialysis unit, the osmosis plant and the tanks of the J.M hospital must undergo a rigorous disinfection process and demand compliance with the established protocols.At the end of April [2017], mothers of patients at the J.M. of los RÌ os reported the contagion of 15 children from the Nephrology ward with infections such as _Klebsiella_, _Staphylococcus_ and _Pseudomonas_. It is presumed that the causes of the contagion are associated with poor water quality, since the 3 tanks of the hospital present fecal coliforms and aerobic mesophiles [?] in high values.Intermittent administration of antibiotics would have prevented the infection from subsiding.A total of 11 466 infants died in 2016, which represents 30.12 percent more deaths than in 2015, according to the epidemiological report by the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, after 3 years without official data.The highest number of deaths occurred in Zulia state (northwest), with 1409 cases; Carabobo (center), 928; Aragua (center), 888; Bolivar (southeast), 802, and Capital District (center), with 735 deaths.Among the most frequent causes of death are neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, hyaline membrane disease and premature birth.--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[Bacterial sepsis is a major complication of chronic hemodialysis and is due mainly to infections of the vascular access site. It occurs more commonly in patients with central venous catheters (CVC) than internal arteriovenous (AV) fistulas or AV grafts. CVC-related infections are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and costs. CVC infections include exit site infection, tunnel infection, and bacteremia; however, bacteremias are the most clinically important because of their common occurrence and potential for multi-organ failure and shock to develop.Most CVC infections are due to Gram-positive organisms, such as _Staphylococcus aureus_, especially methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA). Gram-negative bacterial species are isolated less commonly. Risk factors include poor patient hygiene, previous CVC infection, recent hospitalization, longer duration of catheter use, _S. aureus_ nasal carriage, and diabetes mellitus.Microorganisms adhere to the catheter and develop within a biofilm that forms on the catheter surfaces. Organisms can gain access to the bloodstream after colonizing the cutaneous vascular access site and migrating along either the tract exterior to the catheter or organisms are transferred by contact from the hands of individuals (usually health-care workers) while accessing the CVC, or from the patient's skin/surrounding clothing, to catheter hubs or caps, resulting in the contamination of luminal catheter surfaces. Another potential source for bacteremia, especially Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia, is microbial contamination of the dialysate, which the above article presumes is the cause of sepsis in a cluster of pediatric patients undergoing hemodialysis in Venezuela. The main water source for hemodialysis is the local drinking water supply to which electrolyte concentrate is added to form the dialysate. Gram-negative microbial contamination of the dialysate may release endotoxins that can cause transmembrane stimulation of circulating immune cells in the patient's blood to release proinflammatory cytokines that produce fever and other symptoms of sepsis. However, because of the pore diameter of the intact dialysis membrane, it is thought that passage of organisms across the dialyzer member from the contaminated dialysate to the bloodstream is unlikely to occur, as long as the dialysis membrane is undamaged (Suki WN, Massry SG.
