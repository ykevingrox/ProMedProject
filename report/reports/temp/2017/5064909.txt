After the death of a Maharashtra tourist - [AP] -- last week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] some tourists in Manali also tested positive for influenza. Many patients have been admitted in the Tanda Medical College hospital in Kangra and the IGMC hospital in Shimla. An elderly person died in Dehra because of swine flu a few days ago.As many as 35 patients have died in the last couple of years due to swine flu and more than 250 patients were treated after testing positive for swine flu. The State has 2 pathological labs at IGMC, Shimla and RPMC, Tanda where patients are referred from regional and zonal hospitals.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[H1N1 influenza is actually a seasonal influenza, as repeatedly mentioned in ProMed mail posts. Although the media regularly refer to the virus as ""swine flu"", the term is misleading. An informative source on H1N1 can be found at <http://www.flu.gov/about_the_flu/h1n1/>. The associated influenza infection is preventable as the virus is included in the annual influenza vaccine available for humans. The burden of sick and fatal influenza cases can be understood better if proper incidence rates are calculated based on age stratified population data. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/304>.]
