Minister Dahn said.She noted that the MOH will continue to conduct the previous investigation that is currently on the table so that it can clear all doubts, adding, ""Today [8 May 2017] the MSF was instructed to do a meningitis test on the specimens that we have.""Meningitis is an acute inflammation of the protective membrane covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and inability to tolerate light or loud noise.Meanwhile, Minister Dahn has said as of 7 May [2017], a total of 31 cases, including 13 deaths have been reported from 3 counties.She said a total of 27 cases and 10 deaths have been reported from Sinoe County, while Montserrado County recorded 2 cases and 2 deaths, and Grand Bassa County 2 cases and one death.""Liberia has never experienced meningitis before,"" Dahn said, noting that meningitis normally affects countries that are hot and have long dry season; such as Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Ethiopia and other sub-Sahara countries which usually experience meningitis every 2 years or sometimes annually.""Meningitis can be transmitted through saliva and close body contacts,"" Dahn said, and urged the public not to panic because meningitis can be treated and prevented.She is urging the public to report to health authorities anyone showing signs and symptoms of meningitis so that the person can be treated immediately.[Byline: Cholo Brooks]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[There seems to be a definitive diagnosis at last. The increased surveillance and timely treatment that the Minister of Health has implemented will help to end the outbreak.
