MedPage Today [edited]<https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/64408>During the past 3 months [January to March 2017], there have been 6 cases of the parasitic brain infection known as rat lungworm disease on the Hawaiian island of Maui, which is triple the number reported on that island in the past 10 years, according to a report in STAT News.The disease, carried by rats and transmitted by slugs and snails, results in potentially fatal meningitis. Most previous cases in Hawaii have occurred on the Big Island.For prevention of the infection, officials recommend that all fruit and vegetables be thoroughly washed before eating. Simply killing or burying the slugs isn't sufficient to keep rats from eating them and perpetuating the life cycle.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_, the rat lungworm, is a zoonotic, parasitic nematode where the rat is the definitive host and gastropods (snails or slugs) as intermediate hosts. It is prevalent in parts of Asia, the Pacific islands, and the Caribbean. In the United States, _A. cantonensis_ is established in Hawaii and has been reported by ProMED in 2009 (see below). The slugs are most probably ingested when the green leaves they live on are ingested (salad or juice containing snails, slugs, or larvae).For a recent report of the situation see: Hochberg NS, Blackburn BG, Park SY, Sejvar JJ, Effler PV and Herwaldt BL.
