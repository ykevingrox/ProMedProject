IWACU Burundi [edited]<http://www.iwacu-burundi.org/englishnews/four-deaths-in-kagwema-due-to-cholera/>Two children, a 17 year-old man and a 60 year-old man have already died in a week due to cholera disease in Kagwema area of Gihanga Commune in Bubanza, a western Burundi Province. Quentin Marc Ngendakumana, chief of Kagwema hill, says the symptoms of the affected people are diarrhea and vomiting. ""We rush the affected people to the hospital and 10 of them are already receiving treatment"", says Ngendakumana. He, however, says the hospital is so far from the affected area. ""We must walk about 10 km [approx 6 mi] to reach Gihanga Health District"", he says.The local chief says the Red Cross has already intervened by disinfecting the area and distributing tablets to put into water to be drunk. ""We don't have drinking water and it is the main cause of the disease. We draw water from Rusizi and Gatunguru rivers"", he says.The Kagwema chief urges health officials to immediately intervene when they are alerted. ""An ambulance should be made available to rush patients to the hospital in order to be treated as soon as possible and prevent them from infecting others"", says Ngendakumana. Health officials in the locality call on inhabitants to improve hygiene conditions especially by boiling and filtering water from the rivers before using it.The National Institute of Public Health [INSP] has confirmed by means of laboratory exams that it is cholera. The Ministry of Public Health also calls on the population to consult health services in case of acute diarrhea. ThaddÌ©e Ndikumana, spokesperson for the ministry says a contingency plan has been put in place for a year and adds that the care is free of charge. ""Medicines are necessary to cure the disease as soon as possible"", he says. Ndikumana also says there are many cases of cholera in the DRC, Burundi's neighboring country in the western side. ""Residents of Kagwema travel easily to the DRC and some suspected cases of cholera have been detected in the locality"", he says.In August [2017], the acting governor of South Kivu in DRC, Gabriel Kalonda Mbulu declared the presence of cholera epidemic in his province. More than 2700 cases were recorded including 22 deaths from January to August [2017].[Byline: Diane Uwimana]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - SudanDate: Wed 13 Sep 2017Source: Reliefweb, Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-back-khartoum-north-two-cases>Khartoum--------Two cases of cholera appeared in Khartoum North, after the capital of Sudan witnessed a relatively low infection rate for several weeks. The isolation center in the Nierteti Hospital recorded 6 new cases in the past 2 days. The cholera victims came from Teibat El Ahamda district this weekend [9-10 Sep 2017] and have been taken to the local emergency room, a volunteer reported to Radio Dabanga. ""The emergence of new cases may be a result of the accumulation of rainwater and dirt, and the environmental degradation in the district because of poor drainage.""The volunteer added that the district has seen 21 deaths by cholera and more than 300 cases of infection during the past months. ""Officials and representatives of the constituency in the National Assembly and the Legislative Council should not neglect the district and visit us to find out how the conditions are deteriorating.""Cholera in Khartoum state has re-spread after seeing a significant decrease during the past month [August 2017]. An increase in these rates followed recent rains that caused harm to the streets and environment because of poor drainage, a source in the health sector informed Radio Dabanga. ""Bashair hospital in southern Khartoum received 16 new cases of cholera,"" the source said 3 weeks ago. ""The average number of daily visits ranged from 25 to 30 cases of cholera in the past week.""Central Darfur--------------The cholera isolation center in the Nierteti Hospital in Central Darfur has recorded 6 new cases on [Mon 11 and Tue 12 Sep 2017]. Yesterday, [Tue 12 Sep 2017], a medical source told Radio Dabanga from Nierteti that the centre received 3 cases from the camps for displaced people on [Mon 11 Sep 2017], and received 3 cases from districts in Nierteti town on [Tue 12 Sep 2017]. The number of hospitalized cases in the isolation center reached 15 by yesterday, [Tue 12 Sep 2017], according to the medical source. The director-general of the Ministry of Health of Central Darfur visited the isolation centre and brought 500 intravenous solutions. The director-general said that a special isolation centre for women and another for children will be established, so that not all patients have to be placed in a single ward.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - SudanDate: Sun 10 Sep 2017Source: Reliefweb, Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/18-die-cholera-across-sudan>West Darfur-----------Speaking to Radio Dabanga, a sheikh reported from Murnei in West Darfur that 6 people died of cholera at the Murnei camp for the displaced on Wednesday, 6 Sep 2017. 3 passed away on Friday, 8 Sep 2017.

Outbreaks of the water-borne disease occur regularly in Congo, mainly due to poor sanitation and a lack of access to clean drinking water. But this year's [2017] epidemic, which has already hit at least 10 urban areas including the capital Kinshasa, is particularly worrying as it comes as about 1.4 million people have been displaced by violence in the central Kasai region. The WHO said at least 528 people had died and the epidemic had spread to 20 of Congo's 26 provinces.""The risk of spread remains very high toward the Grand Kasai region, where degraded sanitary and security conditions further increase vulnerability in the face of the epidemic,"" the WHO said in a statement. So far, health officials have recorded more than 24 000 suspected cases of the disease across the vast nation in 2017, averaging more than 1500 new cases per week since the end of July 2017.The WHO sent a team of experts including epidemiologists and public health specialists to Congo this month in an effort to contain the disease's spread.[Byline: Amedee Mwarabu, Joe Bavier, Angus MacSwan]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] Cholera - Nigeria (Borno State)Date: Sun 11 Sep 2017 Source: The Vanguard [edited]<https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/09/death-toll-in-borno-cholera-outbreak-jumps-to-35/>A total of 35 people have now died during a cholera outbreak in northeast Nigeria, up from 21 at the start of the week, local health officials said on [Sun 11 Sep 2017]. ""The number of deaths reported... is 35. The total number of suspected cholera cases is now 1283,"" the Borno state health ministry said in a statement.Most of the cases and deaths have been at the Muna Garage camp on the outskirts of the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, which houses some 20 000 people who have fled the Boko Haram conflict. A total of 775 infections were reported at the sprawling camp, where internally displaced people (IDPs) are living in makeshift accommodation, reliant on food handouts and communal water boreholes.Water-borne diseases are a constant threat because of a lack of adequate sanitation for the camp dwellers, especially during the current rainy season, when poor drainage causes stagnant pools to form. State health officials announced on [Sun 3 Sep 2017] that 14 people had died from 186 suspected cases of cholera in Maiduguri. 2 days later, the toll jumped to 21 from 375 cases. Nigeria's government, domestic and international aid agencies involved in providing shelter, food, clean water and healthcare to the IDPs have been working to contain the outbreak. But it has spread to the town of Dikwa, some 90 km [approx 55 mi] east of Maiduguri, where 438 cases were recorded.Suspected cases were still being investigated in the garrison town of Monguno, 138 kilometres northeast of Maiduguri, said the statement.Maiduguri has seen its population double to 2 million since the start of Boko Haram's Islamist insurgency in 2009, as the violence forced people to seek safe haven from vulnerable rural communities. Overall, at least 20 000 people have been killed and some 2.6 million displaced. Most IDPs live in so-called host communities with distant relatives or friends. The remainder live in camps.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[6] Cholera - South Sudan (Tonji State)Date: Wed 6 Sep 2017Source: Radio Tamazuj [edited]<https://radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/eight-new-cases-of-cholera-reported-in-tonj-east>A total of 8 new cases of cholera have been reported in greater Tonj East County in South Sudan's Tonj State after the outbreak had been contained by health officials in the state in August [2017]. More than 40 people died of cholera and over 1000 others were infected in the state between May and July [2017].Makuei Wek Ngor, the officer in charge of monitor and evaluation at the ministry of health in Tonj, told Radio Tamazuj yesterday [Tue 5 Sep 2017] that 8 people had cholera and it was a result of drinking unclean water and heavy rains in the state.""The patients with cholera are 8...these patients are from Tonj East and the problem in Tonj East is that people don't have clean water. People don't have latrines and health facilities are few and far away, so this is the problem in Tonj East,"" he said.

It was discovered residents in Barangay Badian are relying on a deep well as a source of drinking water.Albay is a province located in the Bicol Region in southeastern Luzon of the Philippines.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
