WNEM [edited]<http://www.wnem.com/story/36423560/health-officials-confirm-319-cases-of-hepatitis-a-during-outbreak>Michigan health officials are continuing to investigate an outbreak of hepatitis A in the southeast part of the state. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reports from 1 Aug 2016 to 15 Sep 2017 there have been 319 confirmed cases of hepatitis A, including 14 deaths. Of those cases, nearly 86 percent have been hospitalized.Health officials said those infected by the illness have ranged in age from 20 to 87-years-old. Two-3rds of those cases were men, officials said.On [Mon 18 Sep 2017], the state Medicaid program issued a letter to healthcare providers about the outbreak, testing information and how to prevent the illness. The letter was sent to more than 5000 Medicaid-enrolled providers in Detroit, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clare and Wayne counties. ""The Southeast Michigan hepatitis A outbreak remains a top priority for public health officials from both the investigation and prevention standpoints,"" said Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for MDHHS.So far, no common source of the outbreak has been identified in food or water. Health experts said transmission does appear to be from person-to-person through illicit drug use, sexual activity, and close contact with household members.Officials said over half of the cases (51 percent) have a history of substance abuse, 28 percent are co-infected with hepatitis C, 15 percent are homeless, and 19 cases (6.4 percent) have a history of recent incarceration.Vaccination is recommended for the following at-risk individuals. ""Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease and in addition to our investigation of current and new cases, our focus is strongly aimed at increasing vaccination in adults, where hepatitis A vaccination is commonly low,"" Wells said.[Byline: Jessica Royce]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This posting further characterizes the HAV infected cohort. In this outbreak, there is a smaller percentage of homeless individuals as compared with the San Diego outbreak. The risk factors for mortality in both of these outbreaks such as co-infection with hepatitis B or C have not been elucidated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
