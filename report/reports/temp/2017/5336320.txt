Duluth News Tribune [edited]<http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/health/4332305-salmonella-reported-nursing-facility>A total of 2 people were hospitalized as a result of a salmonellosis outbreak at a Duluth nursing facility in August 2017, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. All told, 15 people became ill in mid-August 2017 at Bayshore Residence and Rehabilitation, said Doug Schultz, a health department spokesman, but only 5 -- all residents -- tested positive for _Salmonella_. The 15 included 4 staff members and 11 residents, 2 of whom were hospitalized, Schultz said. None died.The health department contacted the facility after it noted a ""cluster"" of cases, Schultz said. Based on what inspectors found, it appeared that the disease was not foodborne but was transmitted via ""contaminated hands of staff or residents."" Earlier this week [week of Sun 17 Sep 2017], Bayshore administrator David Uselman said facility personnel did a thorough examination of the facility's kitchen and concluded that the bacterium had been brought in from the outside.Cleaning the environment was recommended, Schultz said, along with making sure staff are properly trained on hand-washing and then pass along that training to residents.Salmonellosis sickens about a million people in the USA every year, according to the CDC. It leads to 19 000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths annually. Most people infected with salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection.Bayshore Residence and Rehabilitation is licensed by the state to provide 139 nursing home beds.[Byline: John Lundy]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Salmonellosis, because of the relative high number of organisms usually needed to cause infection, is generally not associated with contaminated skin unless the contamination is from a food handler who contaminates the food.  Salmonellosis can be asymptomatic. Lower inocula can be significant in the elderly especially in those with low or absent stomach acid. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354>.]
