An investigation will also be conducted at outpatient services handling exposure to rabies.Any organizations or individuals found illegally storing and transporting vaccines will face ""a severe crackdown"", according to the administration.A scandal broke in 2016 in which millions of dollars of improperly stored or expired vaccines were sold to patients nationwide. A total of 125 people were arrested and 37 officials put under investigation for negligence and graft.
