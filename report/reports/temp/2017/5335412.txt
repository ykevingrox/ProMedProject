9news [edited]<http://www.9news.com.au/national/2017/09/20/12/05/girl-struck-down-with-mystery-flesh-eating-disease-in-victoria>A flesh-eating disease [_Mycobacterium ulcerans_] common in 3rd world countries is infecting parts of Victoria [Australia] at increasingly epidemic rates, and doctors have no idea why._Mycobacterium ulcerans_, an infection which eats away at the limbs like gangrene, has more than doubled in Victoria in the last year, with 240 new cases. In the past few months, 9 people have been diagnosed with it each week.The disease, also known as the Bairnsdale ulcer, is strangely migrating from the Bellarine peninsula to the Mornington peninsula, which has become a hot-spot for the disease.An active and healthy 13-year-old from Tyabb was struck down with _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ in April [2017] and is still trying to recover from the disease that turned her knee into a festering sore the size of her palm. Her mother, who is also a GP, told Nine.com.au that when her daughter 1st complained of a sore knee, there were no visible signs of the disease. ""There was nothing to see; then it started to look a little swollen around the knee but nothing too much to worry about,"" [her mother] said. ""A couple of days later, it started to get the smallest of sores like a scab or a carpet burn and then a bit of redness around it.""[The girl's] parents took her to a local GP, who put her on antibiotics, but the wound continued to get worse. The ulcer is not normally painful, but in Ella's case it was excruciatingly so, Dr Burns said. ""She was on really high, strong painkillers and then the pain settled. Initially, she would get around on crutches or limp.""Swab tests for bacteria came back negative, but Ella's father -- who also has a medical background -- was concerned about the possibility of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, and pushed for a biopsy, which eventually confirmed the disease.[The girl] has since endured 3 operations to clean out the dead tissue around her knee and is still walking with a limp. The wound is healing, but very slowly, [her mother] said. ""It's still not looking that great. We call it the zombie leg,"" she said.The schoolgirl this week started an online petition calling for Health Minister Greg Hunt -- who is also her local MP -- to provide more funding for research into the disease and has already collected more than 6700 signatures.[The girl's] doctor, Daniel O'Brien, who is one of the world's leading infectious disease experts and operates out of the Royal Melbourne and Geelong hospitals, told Nine.com.au that _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ was an epidemic that needed to be addressed urgently. ""Bottom line is we had 70 percent more cases last year [2016] than we have ever had, and we are more than double this year already on last year,"" he said.Just as worryingly, the number of severe cases of the disease, such as [this girl's], had doubled in the last 5 years, he said. ""We don't know why. I can only suspect that the organism has adapted or mutated or evolved so it is becoming more virulent and causing more severe cases,"" he said.The 1st case of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ -- which is found in mostly African countries such as Uganda, Nigeria and Liberia -- was spotted at Bairnsdale in East Gippsland in 1948 and then moved westward across the state. The disease popped up in Phillip Island in the 90s, and in the early 2000s it appeared in the Bellarine Peninsula.Dr O'Brien said it was still a puzzle as to why the disease was migrating around the state, and not much was even known about how it was spread. ""There are theories about transmission via mosquitos, theories about it being in the soil and getting through wounds, theories about whether some animals are involved in that we know that some possums can be affected by it. But we don't actually know where it lives, why it's there, and how it gets spread to humans. How can we possibility halt an epidemic when we don't have that basic information?""Dr O'Brien said funding was desperately needed for scientists to conduct more research into the disease. ""I'm at the forefront as a clinician trying to treat patients and getting more and more overwhelmed but also distressed at the fact that we are doing nothing to try and prevent people getting it in the 1st place,"" he said. ""For me, this is an urgent health problem that our community needs addressed, and I think our government should be putting significant amounts of money into trying to stop it, and that means research.""[Byline: Emily McPherson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a discussion of Buruli ulcer in Australia, see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Buruli ulcer - Australia: (VI) M. ulcerans, increasing incidence 20160821.4431690.Pictures of Buruli ulcers, and a map of Australia that indicates hot spots where the incidence of Buruli ulcer has been reported to be increasing, can be found at <https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1643576/zombie-flesh-eating-bug-is-spreading-across-australia-as-insect-bites-lead-to-volcanic-wounds-and-amputations/>.The Bellarine Peninsula is located southwest of the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellarine_Peninsula>). The Bellarine Peninsula, together with the Mornington Peninsula southeast of Melbourne, on other side of the bay of Port Phillip, are tourist regions with a variety of beaches and seaside resorts and wineries; the City of Greater Geelong is located on the Bellarine Peninsula. A map of this region can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip#/media/File:Portphillip.gif>. Prior ProMED-mail posts have noted the increasing incidence of Buruli ulcer on both the Bellarine and Mornington Peninsulas, as well as in suburbs of Melbourne (see also's below). Melbourne is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and the 2nd most populous city in Australia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne>).
