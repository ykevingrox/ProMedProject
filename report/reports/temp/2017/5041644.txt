As many as 11 of them were local cases (57.9 percent), and 8 were imported cases (42.1 percent). All 11 local cases were reported in the second quarter of 2017, including 9 cases in April and 2 cases in May (37-year-old female and 60-year-old female); all local patients were residents of a rural area.Recently, Beijing also reported a human H9N2 AIV case, the 32-year-old male, outdoor worker, had symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, stuffy and running nose, chills, fatigue, headache, muscular soreness. He is now fully recovered.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the 5th epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 Oct 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves (<http://www.who.int/csr/don/09-may-2017-ah7n9-china/en/>).Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.Monitoring the epidemiological situation and further characterizing the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
