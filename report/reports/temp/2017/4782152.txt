According to the municipal health authorities, tests confirmed that a monkey found dead last month [December 2016] had the disease.The monkey was found dead in a place near an urban area. Since December [2016], residents of the region where the monkey was, have been undergoing vaccination. At the beginning of this month [January 2017] another animal was found dead in a stream but in this case it was not possible to collect samples for tests. ""We will intensify vaccination just as a precautionary measure. There is no reason to panic,"" stated the health coordinator, Vanessa Meneguesso.Because of this, residents of the area were immunized also. Twelve cities of the region have had monkeys dead of yellow fever, and in all of them, preventive action was taken. Yellow fever began to worry the population of the region in [May 2016], when a man died of the disease in Bady Bassitt [municipality of SÌ£o Paulo]. Four months later, dead monkeys were found in Rio Preto [municipality of SÌ£o Paulo] and tests confirmed that they had died of yellow fever also.Since then, blockades and massive vaccination was done in the areas where the monkeys were. Other cities also confirmed monkeys dead of yellow fever. These cases were registered in FernandÌ polis (SP), Novo Horizonte (SP), IbirÌÁ (SP), Pindorama (SP), Potirendaba (SP), Adolfo (SP), Catanduva (SP), CatiguÌÁ (SP), Cajobi (SP), SeverÌ nia (SP), alÌ©m de SÌ£o JosÌ© do Rio Preto and TabapuÌ£.Since these cases tend to increase from December to May, the Ministry of Health issued an alert for the population in the entire country to take the vaccine. The list of the Ministry of Health includes practically all the cities in the north eastern region of Sao Paulo.--communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[Sao Paulo state has had yellow fever fatalities in monkeys in several locations in the past year (2016). Now, a monkey dead of yellow fever has been found in a new location. It seems curious that vaccination appears to have recommended country-wide, and not just in those states and areas where there is a risk of yellow fever. - Mod.TYDr Ana Cecilia B C Pantano Zuiani is thanked for calling this report to our attention.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Brazil can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5649>]******[2] Rio de Janeiro stateDate: Thu 19 Jan 2017Source: The Rio Times [edited]<http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-politics/state-of-rio-de-janeiro-to-receive-250000-yellow-fever-vaccines/>The Health Department in Rio de Janeiro state published a technical note yesterday [Wed 18 Jan 2017] raising the level of vigilance to patients with symptoms characteristic of yellow fever in the 14 municipalities in the North and Northwest Fluminense [Rio de Janeiro state] regions that border Minas Gerais and EspÌ rito Santo states.Authorities announced that a total of 250 000 doses of the yellow fever vaccine were also requested from the Ministry of Health, which will be distributed to these cities, to create a blocking region against the disease virus.Last week [week of 8 Jan 2017] Minas Gerais state's governor, Fernando Pimentel, declared a public health emergency in the eastern part of the state due to the high number of suspected cases of yellow fever, and this morning [Thu 19 Jan 2017] the Ministry of Health confirmed 8 deaths due to the disease.The 8 confirmed fatalities so far this year (2017) in Minas Gerais are already more than the total recorded for the whole year 2015 and 2016 when 5 cases were registered in each. The secretary of health in Rio de Janeiro emphasized that the vaccines are only a precautionary measure, and that no cases of yellow fever were registered in the state of Rio in 2016 and 2017.The vaccinations in the 14 municipalities of Rio will be carried out in compliance with the criteria of the Ministry of Health, according to government news sources. In an integrated action with neighboring states, the Secretariat will provide 400 000 vaccination syringes to the Government of the State of EspÌ rito Santo.The measures in Rio will be applied in the municipalities of Santo AntÌ«nio de PÌÁdua, Miracema, Laje do MuriaÌ©, Itaperuna, Natividade, PorciÌ¼ncula, Varre-Sai, Bom Jesus do Itabapoana, SÌ£o Francisco de Itabapoana, Cantagalo, Carmo, Sapucaia, Comendador Levy Gasparian and in the north of Campos dos Goytacazes.Yellow fever is an acute febrile infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes (in urban areas by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito). The commonest signs and symptoms of the disease are: high fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting that last, on average, 3 days.In the most severe forms of the disease, jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), hepatic and renal insufficiency, hemorrhagic manifestations and intense tiredness may occur.Yellow fever can become more serious, causing heart, liver, kidney problems along with bleeding (hemorrhaging) and jaundice (yellow eyes and skin). Up to 50 per cent of people with the more severe form of yellow fever die of the disease.[byline: Jay Forte]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Given the active yellow fever virus transmission in neighboring states, the health authorities are wise to initiate a vaccination campaign in Rio de Janeiro state now. - Mod.TY]******[3] PAHO/WHO updateDate: Wed 18 Jan 2017Source: PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update, Yellow Fever [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=37709&lang=en>Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------In 2016, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru reported confirmed cases of yellow fever (figure 1: Geographic location of probable and confirmed cases of yellow fever reported in the Americas during 2016 and 2017; see URL above). In 2017, Brazil reported the occurrence of an outbreak in the state of Minas Gerais and epizootics in the neighboring state of EspÌ rito Santo.In Brazil in 2015, 9 cases of jungle yellow fever were confirmed in 3 states: Goias (6 cases), Para (3), and Mato Grosso del Sur (1), with a case fatality rate of 56 per cent. In 2016, 6 cases were confirmed in the states of Goias (3), Sao Paulo (2) and Amazonas (1) [<http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/index.php/cidadao/principal/agencia-saude/27327-febre-amarelaatualizacao-de-casos-suspeitos-em-minas-gerais>]From epidemiological week (EW) [Sun 1 Jan 2017] until [Wed 18 Jan 2017] in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil, 206 suspected and probable cases of yellow fever were reported, including 53 deaths; 22 of the 53 probable cases died (case fatality rate of 42 per cent). Human cases were reported in 29 municipalities, 22 of which also reported the occurrence of epizootics in non-human primates (NHP). In 37 probable cases for which information is available, 35 (95 per cent) are male and the average age is 46 years.In addition, in the neighboring state of EspÌ rito Santo, considered outside the risk area for yellow fever, 4 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported. Likewise, the occurrence of epizootics in NHP have been reported in 14 municipalities of this state (Figure 2: Geographic location of suspected and probable cases of yellow fever reported in Minas Gerais and Espiritu Santo, [2016 to 2017]; see URL above).In Colombia, in EW [Sun 1 Jan 2017], there were no suspected or confirmed yellow fever cases reported. In 2016, up to EW 52, a total of 12 cases of jungle yellow fever were reported, 7 laboratory confirmed and 5 probable.

In 2016, the department of JunÌ n reported the highest number of cases (51 cases), followed by Ayacucho (7) and San Martin (5).Recommendations---------------In the light of the increase in confirmed cases of yellow fever in countries of the Americas Region as well as the increase of epizootic due to yellow fever, PAHO/WHO recommends that member states continue their efforts to detect, confirm and manage cases of yellow fever in a context of circulation of several arboviruses. To this end, health personnel should be kept up-to-date and trained to detect and treat cases especially in known areas of virus circulation.PAHO/WHO urges member states to implement necessary actions to properly inform and vaccinate travelers heading to areas where certification of yellow fever vaccine is mandatory.PAHO/WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to countries with ongoing outbreaks of yellow fever.The recommendations issued in the Yellow Fever Epidemiological Alert of [Mon 9 Jan 2017], previously published in [December 2015], remain in effect.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp[Interested readers are encouraged to access the original report at the above URL, to see the maps and references.
