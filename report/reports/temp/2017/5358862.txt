The Express Tribune [edited]<https://tribune.com.pk/story/1521523/dengue-k-p-fears-diphtheria/>[A] serious threat has emerged for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) [formerly the North-West Frontier Province (NW)] government after 33 cases of diphtheria were reported from the federally administration tribal areas (FATA).Diphtheria is an acute contagious infection caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium diphtheria_. It is marked by the formation of a false membrane in the throat and other air passages causing difficulty in breathing and can be fatal unless treated. Vaccination helps reduce the incidence of the disease.Since FATA lacks health institutions to deal with such outbreaks, patients are ultimately brought to facilities in Bannu [southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]. But with frequent movement of people between tribal areas and K-P, the authorities fear that the outbreak may spread to districts situated close to the affected areas.Officials from the FATA secretariat stated that many dengue cases had been reported from Frontier Region Kohat and Khyber Agency [FATA]. On the other hand, diphtheria cases have also surfaced in Frontier Region [FR] Bannu [FATA] and in the North Waziristan Agency and almost all the patients from these areas have been shifted to the settled areas.""Yes, people in FATA have no other option but to take patients with such complications to Bannu and the provincial capital (Peshawar) at the same time,"" a senior FATA health official said, adding that the ""KP government provided precautionary vaccines to the FATA health department and have told FATA authorities to launch an anti-diphtheria vaccination campaign"".Dr Asghar Khan, a technical officer at the Diseases Surveillance and Response Unit for Fata, stated that 8 diphtheria cases were reported since [30 Aug 2017], while 18 cases have been confirmed from FR Bannu so far in 2017.He added that 4 cases were reported from North Waziristan Agency last week [week of 25 Sep 2017] while a total of 15 cases have been confirmed from the agency in 2017. Most of these cases were traced to the Tehsil of Mir Ali -- a former stronghold of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). He added that at least 1 child, from FR Bannu, has lost his life to the disease. K-P health officials have already told the FATA health officials to immediately respond to the cases to prevent the outbreak from spreading to K-P. ""We know that FATA does not have specialised healthcare and such patients seek care in adjoining districts and the provincial capital,"" read a letter from K-P Expanded Programme on Immunization. The letter was addressed to the FATA Health Services Director-General Dr Jawad Habib.The letter, a copy of which is available with The Express Tribune, read that frequent movement between FATA and settled areas posed a potential threat to the bordering district 'and we fear that we may have an outbreak in the neighbouring districts.'It asked the FATA health authorities to develop proper case response plan, circulate diphtheria case management to all hospitals in FATA, and improve routine immunisation besides developing a plan for procurement of vaccines.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail reported last year (2016) on diphtheria outbreaks in the Pakistan province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) (see also's below) that were attributed to low childhood immunization rates.Pakistan comprises 4 provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 4 territories: the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan#Law_enforcement>). Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is located in the northwestern region of the country and borders Afghanistan to the west (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa>). Peshawar is the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. FATA is a semi-autonomous region in northwestern Pakistan, which consists of 7 tribal agencies (districts) (2 of which are North Waziristan andSouth Waziristan) and 6 frontier regions (one of which is the Frontier Region Bannu), and is directly governed by Pakistan's federal government through a special set of laws called the Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR). FATA borders Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the east and Afghanistan to the west.Bannu, 1 one of 26 districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, borders North Waziristan to the northwest, South Waziristan to the southwest, Karak to the east, Lakki Marwat to the south, and the Frontier Region Bannu to the north (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannu_District>). The city of Bannu, with population of about 1 million residents in 2014, is the district capital (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannu>). Mir Ali is a town in North Waziristan that is 30 km (19 mi) west of the city of Bannu (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Ali,_Pakistan>). The Frontier Region Bannu, with a population of almost 20 000 in 1998, is a unit in the FATA and is administered by the district coordination officer of Bannu District (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Region_Bannu>).
