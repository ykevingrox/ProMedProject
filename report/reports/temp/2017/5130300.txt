WPIX TV [edited]<http://pix11.com/2017/06/22/8-new-yorkers-contract-skin-infections-from-plastic-surgery-in-the-dominican-republic/>Eight New Yorkers have been diagnosed with a bacterial skin infection linked to plastic surgery they received in the Dominican Republic, city health officials said Thursday [22 Jun 2017].All the patients -- 10 in all, including 2 from Connecticut -- who contracted _Mycobacterium abscessus/chelonae_ are women and range in age from 28 and 39 years old.They underwent cosmetic procedures such as liposuction, tummy tucks, and breast augmentations, lifts or reductions between 2 Mar and 27 Apr [2017]. Eight of the patients were treated at Central International de Cirug√å a Estetica (CIPLA) in Santo Domingo.The bacteria cause surgical wound infections and can lead to abscesses, damaged or dead skin, and soft tissue, according to the New York City Department of Health.The women involved in this cluster were hospitalized, had tissue removed, and went through several weeks of intravenous antibiotics, city health commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said.Pain, redness, swelling, and fluid drainage are the most common symptoms. Treatment includes draining or removing the infected tissue and prolonged use of antibiotics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.City officials have issued a health alert, urging anyone who developed a skin infection after undergoing cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic to seek medical care right away. They also warned against so-called ""lipotourism,"" or traveling to other countries for plastic surgery at a fraction of what it would cost in the U.S. ""This recent group of serious infections due to cosmetic surgery obtained abroad underscores the danger and expense many women subject themselves to in order to pursue unrealistic beauty standards,"" State Senator Marisol Alcantara said. ""To any person who is considering travel to the Dominican Republic to obtain plastic surgery, I would urge them to reconsider, as this can be dangerous and can leave them with no legal recourse in the case of malpractice.""Anyone who may have undergone such a procedure in the Dominican Republic and later developed a skin infection should call their doctor or the city health department at 311.Doctors who see patients with symptoms similar to those of _Mycobacterium abscessus/chelonae_ should report them to the city health department at 1-866-692-3641.[Byline: Nick Perozeni]--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm <kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>******[2]Date: Thu 22 Jun 2017Source: New York City Health Department [edited]<http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2017/pr055-17.page>The Health Department announced today [22 Jun 2017] that it has identified a cluster of _Mycobacterium abscessus/chelonae_ skin/soft tissue infections associated with cosmetic surgery performed in the Dominican Republic. There have been 8 cases identified in New York City and 2 in Connecticut this year [2017].Patients often visited their doctors in the United States multiple times before the diagnosis of mycobacteria was suspected. The Health Department has issued a health alert urging medical providers and the public to report any suspect cases of skin and soft tissue infections in patients who report traveling to the Dominican Republic for a cosmetic procedure since January of this year [2017]. Patients have undergone treatment, including hospitalization, surgical removal of infected, damaged or dead tissue, and several-week courses of intravenous antibiotics. To date, no deaths have been identified as part of this cluster.""We urge anyone who has received cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic and developed a skin infection to seek medical care immediately,"" said Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett. ""It is important for people who may have an infection to come forward, seek medical attention, or contact the Health Department via 311. Just as important is to remind anyone who seeks elective cosmetic surgery in New York City, other U.S. states, or abroad to make sure they choose a doctor and a medical facility that is licensed.""""In light of reports of bacterial infection resulting from cosmetic surgeries performed in the Dominican Republic, I urge all New Yorkers to be wary of possible symptoms due to infection,"" said Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). ""The health of our citizens is paramount; if you have traveled to the Dominican Republic in the past several months for a cosmetic procedure and now experience unusual side effects, please see a doctor for examination immediately, and inform them of the nature of your surgery and travel history.""""Lipotourism can have serious health consequences and is no laughing matter,"" said Council Member Salamanca. ""If you or someone you know has been affected, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Health Department for assistance.""The Health Department has been collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since May [2017] to investigate all cases of soft tissue and skin infections associated with ""lipotourism"" to the Dominican Republic. Similar cases have been reported to the CDC in the past, including a cluster in 2003-2004 and most recently in 2013-2014. The CDC is working with authorities in the Dominican Republic to further investigate this situation.Anyone who may have received such a procedure in the Dominican Republic and has developed a skin infection should immediately contact their licensed medical provider or the Health Department through 311. Medical providers who see patients with symptoms should report them to the Health Department at 1-866-692-3641.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail report, Non-TB mycobacteria - USA: ex Dominican Rep, post-cosmetic surg infection, 2013 20160715.4346308:Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are acid-fast bacilli that are part of a grouping separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (<http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html>). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and rapid molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. More slowly growing NTM include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_, _M. kansasii_ and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex.NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, that can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of drinking water distribution systems, constituting a risk for certain patients both by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Water from these systems can also contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. In immunocompromised patients, RGM also cause disseminated infection.Treatment of _M. abscessus/chelonae_ infections usually involves a macrolide such as clarithromycin or azithromycin plus parenteral antibiotics such as amikacin and cefoxitin and surgical debridement with removal of foreign bodies. The initial empiric regimen is modified based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing results.ProMED-mail previously reported on outbreaks of RGM disease occurring after cosmetic surgery performed in the Dominican Republic; see also's below.The Dominican Republic, with a population of about 10 million residents, occupies the eastern 2/3rds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region; the western 1/3rd of Hispaniola is occupied by the country of Haiti (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic>). About 3 million people live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city of the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is a popular tourist destination in the Caribbean and has also been a destination for medical tourism (<https://trends.realself.com/2015/06/16/medical-tourism-dominican-republic-mexico/>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24>.]
