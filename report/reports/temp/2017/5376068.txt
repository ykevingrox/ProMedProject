Times of Zambia [edited]<http://www.times.co.zm/?p=99516>The number of cholera cases in Lusaka (where 1 death has been reported) in the recent outbreak has hit 48. Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya said the number had shot up from 37 previously reported on 12 Oct 2017. Ministry of Health Director of Policy and Planning Maximillian Bweupe said yesterday, 14 Oct 2017, that the majority of the cases had been treated with only 8 still admitted.He said the ministry was carrying on with a program to contain the outbreak from 2 bases in Matero and Chipata townships. ""We are continuing with the health promotions and distribution of chlorine for the chlorination of all drinking water.""Dr Bweupe said although no other part of the country had recorded an outbreak, it was imperative for people to take precautions to reduce the risk of the disease breaking out. He said the 4 newly reported cases had come from the same 3 affected areas of Mazyopa, Chipata, Kabanana and SOS Village. The 1st 9 cases of the current outbreak were reported by the Ministry of Health last Sat 7 Oct 2017. One death, a 3-month old infant, has been reported so far.In 2016, 1170 cumulative cases of cholera were reported in Zambia from 5 Feb 2016, of which 192 cases are laboratory confirmed with 31 deaths reported.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A ProMED-mail HealthMap for Lusaka Province, Zambia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2939>.]******[2] Cholera - MozambiqueDate: Fri 13 Oct 2017Source: Club of Mozambique [edited]<http://clubofmozambique.com/news/cholera-claims-108-lives-in-the-first-10-months-of-the-year-in-mozambique/>Cholera killed 108 people between January and October in 2017 in Mozambique, down from 198 in the same period last year [2016] when 306 people died, health officials have reported.Speaking to the press in Maputo, the head of the Ministry of Health's Epidemiology Department, Lorna Gurjal, said that in the 1st 10 months of this year [2017], 492 152 cases were reported, compared to 591 683 cases registered from January to October 2016. Gurjal said that a cholera epidemic broke out in Memba district, Nampula province, northern Mozambique, last August 2017, and one person died out of a total of 109 cases.Referring to the rainy season, which starts in October in Mozambique and runs through to March, the head of the Ministry of Health's Epidemiology Department warned of the risk for diarrhea diseases and malaria outbreaks. ""With the increase of these diseases, there is usually a greater flow of patients to health units, which can increase health-care waiting times, she said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A ProMED-mail HealthMap for Mozambique can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/177>.]******[3] Cholera - SudanDate: Sat 14 Oct 2017Source: Sudan Tribune [edited]<https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/acute-diarrhoea-kills-800-sudan>An acute watery diarrhea (AWD) outbreak in Sudan has killed 800 people since a year ago, according to the latest update from WHO and the Sudanese ministry of health. The Sudanese government denies a cholera epidemic and insists that it is an infection spread through contaminated food, drinking water, or person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene. According to the WHO, cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of food or water that is contaminated with bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_.""The total number of reported AWD cases across 18 states of Sudan has reached over 35 000, including 800 related deaths since August 2016,"" said the UNOCHA Sudan in its latest bimonthly bulletin. OCHA further stressed that ""active transmission of AWD is ongoing"" in all the country except in West Kordofan and Northern states.Supporting the government point of view, the UN agency said: ""the source of infection is believed to be contaminated open water sources combined with poor sanitation and hygiene practices.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In several countries in east Africa, particularly Ethiopia and Sudan, the governments use the euphemism AWD for cholera. - Mod.LLA ProMED-mail HealthMap for Sudan can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96>.]******[4] Cholera - India (Kerala)Date: Sun 15 Oct 2017Source: Deccan Chronicle [edited]<http://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/151017/cholera-attack-migrant-workers-to-be-screened.html>After Thursday's (12 Oct 2017) detection of 2 cholera cases in the Kozhikode district, health authorities have decided to organize screening camps for migrant laborers returning after Deewali. The labourers reach here after contracting communicable diseases, mostly from out of the state during their sabbatical. ""The decision has gone to the panchayat level, and each PHC would conduct screening at the residential camps of migrants,"" said the additional DMO, Dr Asha Devi. Both the cholera-afflicted, aged 28 and 20, reached here from West Bengal only a few days ago.One is working at SM Street and the other in Narikkuni, and both got admitted to Kozhikode Medical College Hospital (KMCH). One had since been discharged. ""In all probability, they got it back home. We had collected the water samples from SM Street and Narikkuni for lab analysis,"" said the ADMO.Meanwhile, the corporation slapped a notice on the owner whose building was rented out to migrants at SM Street, where 11 laborers were crammed up in a room. In August 2017, 5 laborers got hospitalized with symptoms of cholera at KMCH, all natives of West Bengal staying at Thengilakadavu in Mavoor.Following the outbreak, residents protested against sheltering them in filthy conditions. In July 2016 also, a case of cholera was reported at Edakkad. The district administration had chalked out a project, Garima, to enable them to have a clean and healthy life ensuring good shelters and amenities. Officials would inspect and rate the houses based on 8 factors including toilets, availability of drinking water and general hygienic concept.""The project has just started off and yet to gain momentum,"" said an official at the district collectorate. As per the estimation of the health department, there are more than 30 000 migrant workers in the district. But sources say the real number could be much higher.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
