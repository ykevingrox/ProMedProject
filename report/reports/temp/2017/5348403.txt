To fill that gap and others before the next outbreak hits, researchers are developing a platform to organize and share Ebola data that have so far been scattered beyond reach.The information system is coordinated by the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO; <https://www.iddo.org/>), an international research network based at the University of Oxford, UK, and is expected to launch by the end of the year [2017]. At a meeting to discuss Ebola in September [2017] in Conakry, Guinea, the team heading the platform will seek input from West African scientists, health officials and advocacy groups.""We are looking for West African leadership in this initiative,"" says Laura Merson, associate director of the IDDO. Africans must be involved in the platform's creation so that they can not only use the existing data, but also improve their capacity to conduct research during future outbreaks, says John Amuasi, an infectious-diseases researcher at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine in Ghana and a member of the platform's steering committee. A true partnership would also lessen the general public's mistrust of scientists, he adds.Merson and her collaborators want to avoid the kind of data fragmentation that hindered efforts to stop the outbreak in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. As the Ebola crisis was escalating in October 2014, she visited treatment units in the three countries to advise on research. Merson found tremendous variation in practices, which complicated attempts to merge and analyse the information. For instance, some record books listed lethargy and hiccups as symptoms, whereas others recorded fatigue but not hiccups.""People were just collecting what they could,"" she recalls.

Researchers tested whether recovered patients with neurologic symptoms still had viral loads in the central nervous system.After the recent Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa, it has become clear that many complications of the disease have long-term effects. In particular, it has become clear that Ebola virus can persist in the central nervous system (CNS) and ultimately cause a relapse.In JAMA Neurology (see citation above), Billioux and colleagues investigated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients who had survived Ebola virus disease. The researchers evaluated 165 patients who had recovered from Ebola virus disease for neurological symptoms and examined the CSF of 7 of these patients who had stable symptoms and no other conditions (such as HIV). The patients had been discharged from Ebola treatment between 364 and 459 days before the lumbar punctures took place. The researchers then used RT-PCR to detect, amplify and copy Ebola virus genes.This important study provides the 1st systematic evaluation of CSF in Ebola virus disease survivors. Billioux and colleagues found no evidence of Ebola virus in any of the CSF samples. This may be a result of the relatively long period of time since discharge. It is also possible that the Ebola virus is present in the central nervous system but dormant. However, patients who show symptoms of Ebola virus disease relapse should have their cerebrospinal fluid monitored for the virus.][Byline: CI Villamil]23 Sep 2017.

Counting indirect crisis-related deaths in the context of a low-resilience health system: the case of maternal and neonatal health during the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. Health Policy and Planning. ISSN 0268-1080 (In Press). LSE Research Online; <http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/84134/>[Abstract. While the number of direct Ebola-related deaths from the 2013--16 West African Ebola outbreak has been quantified, the number of indirect deaths, resulting from decreased utilisation of routine health services, remains unknown. Such information is a key ingredient of health system resilience, essential to adequate allocation of resources to both ""crisis response activities"" and ""core functions"". Taking stock of indirect deaths may also help the concept of health system resilience achieve political traction over the traditional approach of disease-specific surveillance. This study responds to these imperatives by quantifying the extent of the drop in utilisation of essential reproductive, maternal and neonatal health services in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak by using interrupted time-series regression to analyse HMIS [Health Management Information Systems] data. Using the Lives Saved Tool, we then model the implication of this decrease in utilisation in terms of excess maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as stillbirths. We find that antenatal care coverage suffered from the largest decrease in coverage as a result of the Ebola epidemic, with an estimated 22 percentage point decrease in population coverage compared to the most conservative counterfactual scenario. Use of family planning, facility delivery and post-natal care services also decreased but to a lesser extent (-6, -8 and -13 p.p. respectively). This decrease in utilisation of life-saving health services translates to 3600 additional maternal, neonatal and stillbirth deaths in the year 2014-15 under the most conservative scenario. In other words, we estimate that the indirect mortality effects of a crisis in the context of a health system lacking resilience may be as important as the direct mortality effects of the crisis itself.]28 Sep 2017. New fast test developed to diagnose Ebola by Northumbria University, UK<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170928084926.htm>[Citation. Northumbria University. Breakthrough in rapid, mass screening for the Ebola virus. ScienceDaily, 2017.A new, faster and safer way of diagnosing the Ebola virus has been developed by an academic from Northumbria University, Newcastle.Research led and carried out by Dr Sterghios Moschos at Northumbria means that patients with Ebola-like symptoms can be identified and treated much sooner and at the point of care, helping to reduce the spread of the disease and risks to others.During the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014, patients tested for the disease had to provide a blood sample for testing in a specialist lab by highly trained staff. There are only a few of these facilities in the world, including Public Health England's Lab in Porton Down in the UK, with each diagnosis of the Ebola virus genome taking between 5-8 hours to confirm.Thanks to the efforts of Dr Moschos' research team, working with a manufacturer of innovative diagnostic solutions, a new point of care diagnostic platform -- EbolaCheck -- has been developed, which can be deployed to the scene of an outbreak. The test can now be carried out on an amount of blood that is 700 times smaller than previously needed -- literally a drop obtained by 'pin pricking' a finger -- and it now takes less than 70 minutes to complete. As a result, the test is much safer to administer, requires minimal training and reduces the cost of diagnosis significantly. Crucially, its performance is comparable to laboratory testing, meaning any patient with symptoms of Ebola can be safely and reliably diagnosed. ...][Byline: Katie Dickinson][If the technology is successful, it could be expanded to include rapid diagnosis of other high-risk viruses. Point-of-care diagnosis would save patients from having go to clinics and risk infecting others, as well as exacerbating their own condition by arduous travel. - Mod.LK][Ref.

Expanding the vaccine to work against three related Ebola viruses could enhance the protection of healthcare workers and others as soon as outbreaks occur. That is because the first inoculations could occur even before public health experts know which exact type of hemorrhagic fever has struck.Lehrer believes that, with adequate funding and the necessary regulatory approvals, the heat-stable vaccine could be on the market in 5-10 years.Researchers at the 2 universities will work with teams from Honolulu-based Hawaii Biotech, Inc.; New Jersey-based Soligenix, Inc.; and Maryland-based Bioqual, Inc.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall28 Sep 2017.
