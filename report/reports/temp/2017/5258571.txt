""Laboratory analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed that he was infected with N fowleri.""Dr Mehdi said Ahmed was taken to a local physician last [Fri 11 Aug 2017] because of a headache, but the next day [Sat 12 Aug 2017] he was taken to the Jamal Noor Hospital (JNH) after his condition worsened. On [Mon 14 Aug 2017] the family took him to the AKUH on the recommendation of JNH doctors, but he succumbed to the deadly infection the next day [Tue 15 Aug 2017], he added.""He offered prayers 5 times a day. N fowleri apparently infected his nervous system during ablution. We are collecting samples from his mosque and the area where he lived to analyse if the water there was chlorinated.""Earlier this month [August 2017] a woman in the city was reported to have died of the bug. According to Dr Mehdi, [AS], 48, from Karimabad had died on [Sun 30 Jul 2017] at a private hospital due to meningitis caused by N fowleri.He said the woman had been suffering from extreme headaches, nausea and drowsiness for some days, adding that she was taken to the Patel Hospital in Gulshan-e-Iqbal on [Sat 29 Jul 2017] when her condition worsened. ""Within 24 hours of her admission to the hospital, she succumbed to the deadly infection.""Naegleria fowleri is a pathogen found in freshwater supplied from rivers and lakes to cities. If the water is supplied unchlorinated, the bug can cause a deadly infection in the central nervous system, resulting in death in almost all the cases because so far there is no cure for it.A recent study, published in the Archives of Pharmacy Practices last year [2016], has found that the highest number of N fowleri cases was reported in 2012 when 22 people in Pakistan died of the water-borne infection.The researchers said that majority of the deaths due to the bug in the country between 2008 and 2015 occurred in the month of July. The mean temperature of the month was between 35å¡C [95å¡F] and 39å¡C [102.2å¡F], while majority of the cases were reported in Karachi.They said that no individual who contracted the disease was able to survive, adding that adults between the ages of 26 and 45 years were the most affected. All of the deaths occurred in the Muslim community, concluded the study. The study also pointed out that chlorination of the municipality water supply was below the World Health Organization's recommended level of 0.5 parts per million.[Byline: M.
