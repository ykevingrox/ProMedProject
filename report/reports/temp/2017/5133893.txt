Gideon e-books, <https://www.gideononline.com/ebooks/outbreaks/>--Communicated by:Prof. Steve BergerGeographic MedicineTel Aviv Medical CenterIsrael<steve@gideononline.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Steve Berger for his submission.Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a diverse group of acid-fast bacilli that are separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (<http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html>). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and rapid molecular diagnostics. Rapidly growing NTM mycobacteria (RGM) usually form colonies within 7 days of in vitro incubation as opposed to slow-growing mycobacteria that require longer incubation. _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group are RGM, which also includes _Mycobacterium goodii_, _Mycobacterium mucogenicum_, _Mycobacterium wolinskyi_, Mycobacterium porcinum_, and _Mycobacterium bolletii_/_M. massiliense_ that are mentioned in the listing above.More slowly growing NTM species that are included in the above listing are _Mycobacterium simiae_, _Mycobacterium haemophilum_ and _Mycobacterium chimaera_. - Mod.ML]
