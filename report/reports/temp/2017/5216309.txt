United News of India (UNI) [summ., edited]<http://www.uniindia.com/doctors-sent-to-help-patients-suffering-from-japanese-encephalitis/health-and-medicine/fullstory/945230.html>A strong medical team led by 30 doctors have started off today [30 Jul 2017] to help people suffering from Japanese encephalitis in interior parts of Churachandpur district [south western Manipur state]. There are no proper roads, hence it was difficult to reach the villages. The matter was discussed in the State Assembly yesterday [29 Jul 2017]. During the meeting, it was reported that the situation is not alarming but the positive cases are showing an increasing trend. About 73 cases have been detected positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE).CM [chief minister of Manipur], Mr Biren said the situation is alarming and it needs to be attended to immediately. [An official] said he instructed the district officials to arrange transport facilities to move the patients to district headquarters or the state capital for medical treatment.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[These 73 cases appear to be confirmed as JE. No mention is made of acute encephalitis syndrome.

Eating lychee on an empty stomach did not trigger encephalitis-like symptoms in hundreds of malnourished children in Muzaffarpur, Bihar in 2014, resulting in deaths. So, a January paper in Lancet Global Health (Association of acute toxic encephalopathy with litchi consumption in an outbreak in Muzaffarpur, India, 2014: A case-control study; <http://goo.gl/2Z93Ha>) [see Acute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638] that pointed to a naturally occurring toxin in the fruit as the prima facie cause for death has been proved wrong.New research from Bangladesh, published in the July 2017 edition of The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (Outbreak of sudden death with acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] among children associated with exposure to lychee orchards in Northern Bangladesh, 2012; <http://goo.gl/F9VRMC>), has proved that it is not the fruit but a banned pesticide that is the actual culprit. It may appear as though the last word on the issue has been spoken. But that is not the case.
