According to the WHO statement, the recorded suspected cases were in 22 out of 23 provinces. The UN agency said the highest number of fatalities, 382 cases, was recorded in the northwestern Hajjah province, while in western Yemen's Hudaida province only around 70 000 suspected cases were recorded.Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign in 2015 aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government.According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), over 3 million people have fled their homes since the onset of the Yemen conflict, and more than 20 million throughout the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.[Byline: Mohamed al-Samei]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although a number of sources have reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period.The statistics related to this record-breaking epidemic of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 182825 Jul / 402 484 / 188026 Jul / 408 583 / 188529 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199720 Aug / 542 278 / 200325 Aug / 565 041 / 2018In the last complete year of data (2015; <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>), WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
