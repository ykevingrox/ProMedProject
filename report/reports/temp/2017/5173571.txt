Times Union [edited]<http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Saratoga-County-resident-with-Powassan-virus-dies-11283838.php>A Saratoga County [New York] resident who was recently diagnosed with Powassan virus -- a rare but often fatal tick-borne disease -- has died, the state Department of Health said [Wed [12 Jul 2017].State health officials would not say whether the person died of Powassan virus or had some other underlying illness or complication. Bryon Backenson, director of the State Health Department's Vector Surveillance Unit, cited patient confidentiality reasons.The patient was likely exposed to Powassan virus in May and died in June [2017], Backenson said. The state will report the case to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later this week.A person can be infected with Powassan virus 15 minutes after being bitten by a tick that carries it. That's not much time to find and remove a tick and far quicker than the time it takes to transmit the more common Lyme disease; officials say it takes more than a day for a tick with Lyme to infect a person with that germ.Yet Backenson stressed that New Yorkers should not panic over this single case of Powassan. The patient is the only person to contract the virus in New York so far this year [2017]. There have been 24 cases statewide since 2000, resulting in 5 deaths. One of those deaths was another Saratoga County resident in 2013.By comparison, there are about 8000 reported cases of Lyme each year, and hundreds of cases each of other tick-born illnesses like anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Plus, Backenson said, New Yorkers get lots of tick bites that are no more than an annoyance.""It's exceedingly rare,"" Backenson said of Powassan virus. ""There's 30, 40, 50 000 tick bites that happen in New York every year, and the number that actually lead to cases of Powassan are one or 2, on average.""A study conducted several years ago by the Health Department and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook found a higher number of ticks than expected carried Powassan virus in the Hudson Valley, particularly east of the Hudson River, over a 5-year period ending 2012. In a study of 13 500 ticks, researchers found as many as 6 percent with the virus, depending on the county.But Backenson said that has not translated into a big rise in Powassan virus [infections]. ""It's not like we're seeing rapidly increasing numbers of Powassan [cases],"" Backenson said. ""It's one of the things that we see from time to time. It's very sad when someone ends up getting it.""Signs and symptoms of Powassan virus infection can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss, according to CDC. Long-term neurological problems may occur.There is no known treatment for the virus but people with severe cases may be hospitalized for breathing support, intravenous fluids, or medications to reduce brain swelling.To reduce the risk of infection, health officials advise using tick repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, avoiding bushy and wooded areas, and doing thorough tick checks after spending time outdoors.[Byline: Emily Masters, Claire Hughes]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of New York can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35862>. Saratoga County can be seen on the map at <http://geology.com/county-map/new-york-county-map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJIn 2013, there were several cases of encephalitis caused by Powassan virus (POWV) infection in New York's lower Hudson Valley, and especially in Putnam County (see ProMED-mail posts listed below). A follow up study provided a good description of the tick virus vector and POWV relationship in the 2007-2012 period, and the prevalence of POWV in ticks during that time span (see Tick-borne encephalitis virus - USA: (NY) Powassan virus 20140823.2716624). There is no reason to think that the prevalence and geographic distribution of ticks and virus is restricted in New York state to the lower Hudson River Valley. Saratoga county is located in the upper Hudson River Valley.As the report above mentions, the remarkable thing about POWV transmission by the deer tick (_Ixodes scapulars_) is the remarkably short feeding time required to transmit the virus. The rapid transmission of this virus by its vector is discussed in: Hermance ME, Thangamani S. Powassan Virus. An emerging arbovirus of public health concern in North America. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2017; 17(7); doi: 10.1089/vbz.2017.2110. [Epub ahead of print] <http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/vbz.2017.2110>: ""The duration of _Ixodes scapularis_, the deer tick, attachment required for successful transmission of Powassan virus to a host was found to be as little as 15 min by Ebel and Kramer (Ebel GD, Kramer LD. Short report: duration of tick attachment required for transmission of Powassan virus by deer ticks. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2004; 71(3): 268-71; <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8332784_Short_report_Duration_of_tick_attachment_required_for_transmission_of_Powassan_virus_by_deer_ticks>) in 2004. This Â nding was particularly striking because unlike other tickborne pathogens (_Borrelia burgdorferi_, _Babesia microti_, and _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_), very little time between tick attachment and virus transmission is needed. - Mod.TY]
