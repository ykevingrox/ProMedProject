Orlando Sentinel [edited]<http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-legionnaires-metro-west-20170703-story.html>A 2nd LA Fitness gym has tested positive for [_Legionella_], the bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease.The LA Fitness club at 4792 Kirkman Road had a positive test for _Legionella_, [the bacteria] that cause deadly Legionnaires' disease. It comes less than a week after another LA Fitness club near the Hunter's Creek area tested positive for _Legionella_.Investigators from the Florida Department of Health in Orange County began investigating the 2 health clubs in May 2017 after 4 individuals that use the facilities came down with Legionnaires' disease.""There were 14 pre-remediation samples taken at the LA Fitness Metro West,"" said Kent Donahue, spokesman for the Florida Department of Health in Orange County in an email. ""Of those, one (1) bulk water sample came back positive for _Legionella_.""The health department told both gyms to hyper-chlorinate water and put filters on shower heads. The agency is still waiting for follow-up results to see whether the recommendations fixed the _Legionella_ bacteria problem.Donahue said the 4 individuals that got Legionnaires' [disease] did not seek further treatment._Legionella_ bacteria [are] common in lakes, streams and rivers, but can grow and become harmful inside of closed water systems, such as pipes. Larger buildings seem to have more issues, health professionals have said.LA Fitness officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest positive test but have said they followed recommendations and hired a water treatment company for both facilities. LA Fitness has been involved in 2 other Legionnaires' investigations in Orange County in the last decade, including in 2008 at a club on Michigan Street in Orlando and in 2010 at an LA Fitness center in the Waterford Lakes area.[Byline: Kyle Arnold]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Two LA Fitness health clubs in Orlando (Orange County), Florida have been under investigation after 4 customers contracted legionnaires' disease. Two of the cases are tied to the club in MetroWest at 4792 Kirkman Road, and the other 2 cases are tied to the LA Fitness club at 12 700 S. Orange Blossom Trail. Both LA Fitness clubs have now tested positive for _Legionella_; but the news reports do not specify whether the species and genotypes of _Legionella_ isolated from patients and the environmental water sources matched. Matching genotypes from patient and environmental isolates will confirm transmission pathways.An LA Fitness health club in Ocoee, a city also in Orange County, Florida, which was associated with 3 cases of legionnaires' disease in April 2017 (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (03): (FL) spa & showers susp, RFI 20170422.4987402), was also investigated for the presence of _Legionella_, but results were reportedly negative (Legionellosis - USA (05): (FL,NYC,NV) 20170613.5102471).The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4729>.
