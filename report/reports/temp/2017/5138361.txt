Panama America [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/provincias/confirmado-madre-e-hijo-con-hantavirus-en-los-santos-1074983>A mother and son are positive for hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Los Santos province.The Ministry of Health reported that these patients, 56 and 37 years old, respectively, are residents of Las Tablas and currently in stable condition in the Anita Moreno Hospital in La Villa, Los Santos.These are the 1st 2 positive cases with cardiopulmonary syndrome since febrile [hantavirus infection] cases were reported over the past months [not cardiopulmonary syndrome cases].The 2 patients are being attended to in the intensive care unit of that hospital in La Villa.In 2016, there were no cases of hantavirus [infection], whereas in 2015, 25 cases were registered.[Byline: Zenaida VÌÁsquez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious disease and can develop quickly, with a case fatality rate of around 30 percent.This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infections nor specify the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on these or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS.In the report above, no mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred. The croplands and food sources of the area, such as stored grain, attract the rodent host of Choclo virus. The preventive measures indicated in previous reports included elimination of sites attractive to rodents. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41718>. - Mod.TY]
