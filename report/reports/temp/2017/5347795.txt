The good news is that there were no newly reported cVDPV cases in Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 2 countries with active cVDPV outbreaks ongoing this year (2017). The SitRep report on the Syria outbreak and response is optimistic, with ongoing control activities and improved surveillance indicators.The not so good news is the confirmation of a WPV1 associated case of paralytic disease reported from the Lakki Marwat district in the Khyber Pakhtoon province with a date of onset of paralysis 21 Aug 2017. That, combined with the isolation of 4 new WPV1's in environmental samples in Pakistan from Killa Abdulladh district in Balochistan province (one positive sample), and 3 positive samples from Sindh province (Karachi district one positive sample, Jacobabad district one positive sample and Karachi Gadap district one positive sample) in addition to 2 positive environmental samples for WPV1 in Kandahar province in Afghanistan is confirmation of continued circulation of the WPV1 in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.A map showing the global distribution of all WPV1 associated cases and cVDPV associated cases can be found at:<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at:Pakistan: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.Afghanistan: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/137>Syria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>. - Mod.MPP]
