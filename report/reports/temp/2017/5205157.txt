However, this report does not provide location details.The last ProMED-mail post about chikungunya activity in Pakistan was released on [23 Jun 2017, archive no. 20170623.5127317] stating that the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU) reported 3514 cases [between 19 Dec 2016 and 11 Jun 2017]. Since the southwestern monsoon season started in June, it is highly likely that case counts will continue to increase in the coming weeks.Has anyone been able to locate more updated reports from RDSRU? Also, has anyone seen reports about case counts in Gwadar?Hopefully, the US CDC will issue a travel advisory soon.--Melissa Dudley, MPHSenior Health Intelligence AnalystIJET International<dudleym@ijet.com>[Based on the recent report from the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU), from 19 Dec 2016 to 22 Jul 2017, a total 3669 suspected cases of chikungunya were identified and registered using the following WHO recommended case definition in the different towns of Karachi: ""A person with acute onset of fever (102 deg F/39 deg C) and severe arthralgia or arthritis not explained by other medical conditions, and who resides or has visited epidemic or endemic areas within 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms.""A total of 502 samples were sent from Sindh to National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad for Laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Out of these, 348 samples were found positive for chikungunya virus on RT-PCR. Samples from suspected cases have been received from other provinces including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Punjab, and Islamabad Capital territory (ICT).The total suspected case numbers mentioned in the news report above are much higher than the figures shared by RDSRU Sindh, as perhaps it covers other regions/provinces.ProMED-mail thanks Dr Muhammad Asif Syed, Provincial Technical Officer the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit, Karachi, Sindh, for the information above on the chikungunya outbreak. - Mod.UBA][See Also:Chikungunya (23): Asia (Bangladesh), case numbers 20170711.5165290Chikungunya (22): Americas, Asia 20170704.5149989Chikungunya (21): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170626.5132080Chikungunya (20): Asia (Pakistan) 20170623.5127317Chikungunya (19): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170610.5096983Chikungunya (19): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170610.5096983Chikungunya (17): Asia (Bangladesh) 20170518.5044158Chikungunya (16): Asia (Bangladesh) 20170515.5037500Chikungunya (15): Asia (Pakistan) 20170511.5020435Chikungunya (14): Asia (Pakistan) 20170507.5019416Chikungunya (13): Asia (Pakistan) 20170429.5000142Chikungunya (12): Asia (Pakistan) 20170420.4978219Chikungunya (11): Asia (Pakistan) 20170405.4947304Chikungunya (10): Asia (Nepal) 20170402.4942966Chikungunya (09): Asia (Pakistan) 20170327.4929182Chikungunya (08): Asia (Pakistan) 20170316.4901816Chikungunya (07): Asia (Pakistan) WHO 20170302.4870168Chikungunya (06): Americas, Asia, research 20170206.4817959Chikungunya (05): Asia (Pakistan) 20170120.4774934Chikungunya (04): Asia (Pakistan) spread 20170116.4767440Chikungunya (03): Asia (Pakistan) 20170110.4754019Chikungunya (02): Asia (Pakistan) 20170107.4742890Chikungunya (01): Asia (Pakistan) 20170102.4731668].................................................dk/uba/mj/dk"
