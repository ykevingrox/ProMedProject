Two of the newly confirmed cases were from Makkah region (1 from Taif, 1 from Al Khurma) and the 3rd newly confirmed case was from Hafr Albatin (Ash Sharqiyah region or the Eastern Region).I need to mention that the numbers of recoveries I've presented do not agree with the numbers currently on the MOH website. In this 6 day period, the MOH website mentioned 2 newly reported recoveries in their tally, but no information is provided for these cases. I have chosen to use the figures from the spreadsheet I have been maintaining on Saudi MOH reports.Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of above mentioned cases, deaths and recoveries can be found at the source URLs.
