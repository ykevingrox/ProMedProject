Saudi MOH 7 Aug 2017 [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2017-08-07-001.aspx>As of [Mon 7 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:1686 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including683 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.5 per cent],988 recoveries, and15 currently active cases/infections.[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]Since the last ProMED-mail update [Sun 6 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:3 newly confirmed cases0 newly reported fatalities, and0 newly reported recoveries.Information on newly reported cases (3 cases)1- A 50-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Ha'il [Ha'il region] noted to be in critical condition. Classified as a primary case with a history of indirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.2- A 16-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Dawmat Aljandal [Al Jawf region] noted to be in stable condition. Classified as a secondary case in a household contact.3- A 12-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Dawmat Aljandal [Al Jawf region] noted to be in stable condition having been identified as an asymptomatic contact of a previously confirmed case. Classified as a secondary case in a household contact.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the past 24 hours there have been an additional 3 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in Saudi Arabia. 2 of these cases are household contacts of a previously confirmed case in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region) and the 3rd is a primary case with a history of indirect contact with camels in Ha'il.Of the 2 household contacts, one was asymptomatic, the other noted to be in stable condition. These are now the 2nd and 3rd infections confirmed in contacts of a previously confirmed case. It is noteworthy that there has been an increase in asymptomatic infections identified in Saudi Arabia since they started screening all contacts, not just symptomatic contacts, suggesting that there is more transmission ongoing than previously identified, with more asymptomatic or mild infections detected.A map of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of these 3 newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL above.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
