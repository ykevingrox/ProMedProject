NBC Montana [edited]<http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/keci/ravalli-co-public-health-tracks-whooping-cough-cases/615161618>The following release was sent out by Ravalli County Public Health: Ravalli County is experiencing an outbreak of pertussis. This August [2017] there are currently 5 confirmed cases in an isolated population cluster to date. ""Contacts of confirmed cases are being tested and/or prophylaxed (treated to prevent illness),"" stated Dr Carol Calderwood, Health Officer for Ravalli County Public Health. ""We are working to identify, educate, and treat before more people become symptomatic.""Ravalli County Public Health is working proactively with local physicians to identify close contacts of confirmed cases. A close contact is a household member of a confirmed case, anyone who has been within 3 feet for an hour, or has been coughed on directly. Public Health wants the public to be aware, especially with the current smoky conditions, upcoming flu season, and increased congregation (school, fair, sports, etc.), to take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones.""We are advising that people experiencing a progressive cough be seen. Also, any person in close contact to a person with confirmed pertussis should be seen by their primary care provider or at a walk-in clinic,"" stated Calderwood. Untreated, exposed people may be spreading pertussis even before they become symptomatic. Pertussis has an incubation period of 21 days. An untreated close contact is able to spread the disease for that period.Contacts without symptoms and taking the 5-day course of antibiotics may continue their normal activities. Contacts with symptoms and taking antibiotics should remain home until all treatment is taken. Contacts not yet taking prophylaxis should remain home. ""If you are a close contact not receiving treatment we are asking that you stay home for 21 days,"" Calderwood reiterated.With cooperation between Public Health and the community, this current cluster can be quickly contained. Public Health is also working closely with community partners to have proactive intervention plans in place; including exclusion protocols, to help protect our most vulnerable citizens. As always, you may also contact Public Health at 375-6671 with questions or to obtain vaccination.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Ravalli County, with a population of 40 212 residents in 2010, is located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Montana; it is often referred to as the Bitterroot Valley, with the Sapphire Mountains on the East and the Bitterroot Mountains and is on the West on the western side of the Continental Divide (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravalli_County,_Montana>). - Mod.ML******[2] MichiganDate: Fri 25 Aug 2017 11:11 AMSource: The Daily Reporter [edited]<http://www.thedailyreporter.com/news/20170825/whooping-cough-outbreak-continues>The Branch-Hillsdale-St. Joseph Community Health Agency [CHA] is continuing their investigation into an outbreak of pertussis -- also known as whooping cough -- in St Joseph County.The CHA has treated approximately 233 people for pertussis with antibiotics over the last month [August 2017], according to CHA Prevention Services Director Val Newton.The outbreak began in June [2017] with one Amish family and spread through that community. Newton said the treatment has been confined to the Amish, with the exception of one case. ""We are investigating to see if there might have been contact,"" she said.An Amish family volunteered their home for an immunization clinic because of the outbreak. ""There are 34 people who received 60 vaccines,"" Newton said. ""This family has offered us the use of an Amish community building for us to do monthly immunizations.""

Health officials say immunization data shows an increase from 113 reported cases of pertussis in 2016 to 151 reported cases so far in 2017. Pertussis cases have occurred across the state, including multiple outbreaks in Calhoun and Chambers counties.""Patients should be aware that this is a serious disease that can affect people of all ages,"" said Dr Karen Landers, Assistant State Health Officer. ""It can even be deadly for babies less than a year old. That's why it's especially important for parents and grandparents who are in close contact with infants to make sure they are up to date on their vaccinations.""The CDC says the best way to protect against the whooping cough is the vaccine:All students 11 [years of age] and older entering the 6th grade in Alabama schools must have a tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. Each pupil 11 or older who enters the 6th grade will be required to have a new certificate of immunization. This is because of the change from tetanus-diphtheria (Td) to (Tdap) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine will protect adolescents from pertussis and keep them from spreading disease to siblings, other family members and other students. The Tdap school requirement will go up by one higher grade each school year. For example, Tdap is now required for students entering 7th grade through 10th grade in 2014-2015, and will be required for students up through 12th grade in 2016-2017. - Adolescents who have already received a booster dose of Td are encouraged toreceive a dose of Tdap. A 5-year interval from the last Td dose is encouraged, but an interval as short as 2 years may be used if pertussis immunity is needed. -  All adults should receive a booster dose of Td every 10 years. Tdap is licensed for only one lifetime dose per person. Adults who have never received a dose of Tdap should substitute it for their next booster dose.  - A dose of Tdap is recommended for adults who expect to have close contact with an infant younger than 12 months of age. - Healthcare workers who have direct patient contact should receive a dose of Tdap. - New mothers who have never received Tdap should get a dose as soon as possible after delivery. If vaccination is needed during pregnancy, Td is usually preferred over Tdap.  - Adolescents and adults who require a tetanus-containing vaccine as part of wound management should receive a dose of Tdap instead of Td if they have not previously received Tdap. If Tdap is not available or was previously administered, Td should be administered.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The U.S. state of Alabama, located in the southeast along the Gulf of Mexico, has 67 counties, a map of which can be found at (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Alabama>). - Mod.ML]******[4] AlbertaDate: Thu 24 Aug 2017Source: Medicine Hat News [edited]<http://medicinehatnews.com/news/local-news/2017/08/24/whooping-cough-continues-to-spike/>The number of people affected by an outbreak of whooping cough continues to increase in southern Alberta, including Medicine Hat, says Alberta HealthServices [AHS].A total of 305 cases of whooping cough (pertussis) have been diagnosed in the south zone, said Dr. Lena Derie-Gillespie, medical officer of health in the AHS south zone. The number of cases only in Medicine Hat was not available.Of the 305 cases, there are 257 related to the initial outbreak that was in the western part of the south zone, in particular communities that don't have high immunization rates, said Derie-Gillespie, who declined to name a specific community.Medicine Hat was initially considered a ""cluster"" and not considered related to the outbreak. ""In the last couple weeks we are seeing outbreak cases that are occurring outside of that west zone,"" said Derie-Gillespie. ""We consider now the entire zone (including Medicine Hat) is part of the outbreak.""In an outbreak, most cases are among unimmunized people particularly in children, said Derrie-Gillespie. In diagnosed cases, of those who have been immunized, there seems to be a spike in the kids about 11-and 12-years-old. ""This does not mean that the 11-and 12-year-olds are most at risk to get pertussis,"" she explained. ""The younger unimmunized ones are still most at risk.""This age group may be experiencing ""waning benefits"" from the last vaccine, she said. To address this, those between the ages of 10 and 12 can register to receive a booster dose of the vaccine. Booster doses will be administered by appointment at clinics in Medicine Hat today, Aug. 30 and Aug. 31 [2017]. These will take place at Higdon Hall on the Medicine Hat Stampede Grounds. Clinics will also take place in Brooks on [Wed Thu 30 and 31 2017]. To make an appointment, call the local community health office at 403-502-8215.Pregnant women in their 3rd trimester are also offered the vaccine routinely as their pregnancy progresses in order to offer some protection to newborns, who are particularly vulnerable.If you get whooping cough you will be infectious for 3 weeks starting from the early symptoms, said Derrie-Gillespie. With symptoms that could seem like just a cold initially, there is a judgment call about the point at which you need to seek medical attention and a diagnosis. However, take all the precautions you would to avoid spreading germs: Hand hygiene, coughing into your arm and washing your hands regularly.If you are not well don't go about mixing with other people in the community, particularly around babies, said Derrie-Gillespie. If you have a cough that is lasting a long time or symptoms that seem a little different to your normal colds, or if you know you were exposed to someone with pertussis, stay home and call your health-care provider or Health Link for instructions, said Derrie-Gillespie.[Byline: Gillian Slade]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[South Zone, with a population of 281 934 residents in 2010, is the area south of Calgary, the largest city in the Canadian province of Alberta (<http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/about/southzone.aspx>).
