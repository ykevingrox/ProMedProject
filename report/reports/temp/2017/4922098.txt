The Record [edited]<http://www.therecord.com/news-story/7200186-small-increase-in-mumps-cases-in-waterloo-region/>So far this year [2017], 3 confirmed cases of mumps have been reported in Waterloo Region, mirroring a widespread bump in the virus's activity.""It's definitely something people should be aware of, but the risk is pretty low because most of our population is immunized,"" said Kristy Wright, manager of infectious diseases for Region of Waterloo Public Health.""There's no need to panic. We're quite used to having this cyclical activity with mumps.""There's been increased mumps activity across Ontario, as well as Canada and the United States. ""It is circulating. There is sporadic activity,"" Wright said.In Guelph, there are 3 confirmed cases among university aged people linked to a keg party held in mid-January [2017]. 2 more suspected cases are being followed.Toronto Public Health is investigating a mumps outbreak in the city. There were 43 confirmed cases by [15 Mar 2017].Wright said people should check their immunization records to ensure they've received 2 mumps vaccines, which is needed for optimal protection. The 1st dose is given around the 1st birthday, and the 2nd between 4 and 6. Some people only received 1 dose as a child. They can get a 2nd dose now.Those most affected by the recent spike in mumps activity are people 17-35 years old. It's thought the longer the time from the 2nd dose, the more susceptible a person may be.""We do see some waning effect, especially as you get older,"" Wright said.The virus is spread through droplets and requires close contact. That can include sharing drinks, kissing, and coughing or sneezing within one metre.""It tends to be a very social age group,"" Wright said. ""That might contribute to spread among that age group.""Symptoms include fever, headache, and swelling in the salivary glands, Wright said. ""There are a lot of people who just have respiratory symptoms.""Complications such as meningitis are possible but rare, and most people are better in about a week.Mumps activity goes in cycles and, fortunately, large outbreaks are rare because of high immunization rates, Wright said. Last year [2016], there was one case in the region. ""And in other years we have none at all,"" she said.The virus has a long incubation period, upwards of 25 days before symptoms appear. ""You can be contagious but not show any symptoms,"" said Chuck Ferguson, spokesperson for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.He said the department is watching to see if anyone in contact with the current cases develops mumps to know if it's spreading in the community and who is at risk.[Byline: Johanna Weidner]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Canada can be accessed at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>. - Mod.LK]******[2] USA (Illinois)Date: Wed 22 Mar 2017 5:15 AM CDTSource: Daily Herald [edited]<http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20170322/news/170329654/>Station Middle School [Barrington, Cook and Lake counties, Illinois] now has 3 confirmed cases of the mumps, making it the 2nd Barrington Area Unit School District 220 school to have an outbreak of the disease, district officials said [Tue 21 Mar 2017]. At Barrington High, the number of confirmed mumps cases increased to 6, and Superintendent Brian Harris said it could eventually go to as high as 10.""I wouldn't be surprised,"" said Harris at the board of education meeting at Barrington High Tuesday night [21 Mar 2017]. ""10 reported cases out of approximately 3500 people who are in and out of this building every day is still well below the public health information that talks about the effectiveness of vaccines.""According to the CDC, the mumps component of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses.""I do believe our school community has responded appropriately and diligently in all regards,"" Harris said. ""I do believe that is part of the reason why we've seen so many reporting, I think parents and students are following up as we asked.""The Lake County Health Department updates their website [<http://lakecountyil.gov/3875/Mumps>] daily with the latest number of confirmed, probable, and suspected mumps cases.On 13 Mar 2017, the health department held a vaccination clinic for Barrington High School staff and students who were not up to date with their MMR vaccinations. Harris said 85 staff members took advantage of the opportunity. He said students likely didn't take advantage because more than 99 percent of them have received 2 MMR vaccines already. Adults born after 1957 and before 1989 were only required to get 1 MMR vaccine, so Harris said the staff members used the clinic to get a 2nd dose.Harris said there will be a similar clinic offered to staff and students and Station Middle School in the coming weeks.When new confirmed cases trickle in, it means the district's small number of students who are unvaccinated for religious or medical reasons have to spend more and more time away from the student population. The district has been helping those students continue their education from home in a variety of ways, including having access to coursework through their school-issued laptops. Harris said they are also inviting the students to come in and receive one-on-one instruction after school for things like tests and time learning in the lab.The schools are thoroughly cleaned each night to health department specifications.Mumps is a serious contagious disease. Common symptoms are fever, headache, and muscle aches, though up to half of people who get it have mild or no symptoms.[Byline: Doug T Graham]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Illinois can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/23024>.

Since then, there have been nearly 3000 cases of the disease across 33 counties in the state.As a public health practitioner, I wondered: Why did this outbreak take off?My team at HealthMap, a computational epidemiology lab based out of Boston Children's Hospital, began by rounding up as much data as we could.We quickly discovered that the Arkansas Department of Health was releasing semi-regular PDF reports on the outbreak. The reports broke down cases by county, age, and school district (many of the people who have contracted mumps in the Arkansas outbreak are children). But there were no historical archives that could give us a sense of how the outbreak had grown over time.So we turned to a tool called the HealthMap Digital Surveillance System, which collects social media reports and news about public health issues around the world and turns them into usable epidemiological data. (For example, this blog previously reported on how we used our surveillance system to collect Google search and participatory public health data to track and predict flu outbreaks.)From the HealthMap data about the mumps outbreak, we were able to estimate the total number of cases that had occurred since August 2016.At that point, we had all the information we needed to tackle a more difficult question: What could the data tell us about vaccination in communities affected by the outbreak?Before we get to our answer to that question, let's talk about mumps.Mumps, like measles and rubella, is extremely contagious. Because of this, the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine is given in 2 doses. Even with both doses, the vaccine is imperfect. One out of every 10 individuals who receives it remains susceptible to the mumps virus. In the event of a mumps outbreak, some people who get sick will be people who were vaccinated; how many depends on what percentage of the people in the affected community are vaccinated.For a disease as contagious as mumps, a 2-dose community-level vaccination rate as high as 96 percent may be necessary to prevent active transmission of the virus, maintaining so-called herd immunity. When the vaccination rate drops, herd immunity breaks down and outbreaks can take off.The Arkansas Department of Health doesn't generally report high-resolution vaccination statistics to the public. But it has been collecting self-reported data on vaccination from individuals who were diagnosed with mumps during this particular outbreak. In the department's latest report, an average of about 70 percent of people who got mumps said they had received both doses of the mumps vaccine.However, studies have shown that self-reported vaccination rates are typically 1.5 to 2 times greater than actual vaccination rates. This means that the true 2-dose vaccination rate among mumps cases in Arkansas was probably closer to 35-46 percent.But what about vaccination rates in the larger communities that these cases came from?After pairing our surveillance data with mathematical modeling methods, we estimated that the average 2-dose vaccination rate in communities affected by the outbreak was likely no higher than 89 percent and may have been as low as 70 percent, well below that ideal rate of 96 percent.Our complete methodology can be found in a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [see citation below].As vaccine hesitancy gains ground in the United States, we place ourselves at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella. While these childhood illnesses aren't fatal to most people, those who are most susceptible to serious adverse effects, such as children under the age of 1 and cancer patients, are often those who can't be vaccinated.And this is why herd immunity is so important. When we vaccinate, we protect not only ourselves but the most vulnerable members of our communities, too.[Byline: Maimuna Majumder]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Reference--------Majumder MS, Nguyen CM, Cohn EL et al: Vaccine compliance and the 2016 Arkansas mumps outbreak.
