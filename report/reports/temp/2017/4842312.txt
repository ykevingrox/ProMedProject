Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/spain-a-dozen-measles-cases-reported-in-barcelona-19585/>Health officials in Catalonia have reported 12 measles cases among young adults in Barcelona, according to a La Vanguardia report (computer translated). The 12 cases diagnosed so far in the metro Barcelona area are linked to the same original patient, a person who became infected in China in early January [2017], as stated in the circular that the Agency of Public Health of Catalonia has sent to all health centers.Measles was eradicated from the area since 2000; however, sporadic outbreaks still occur.""It is not unusual to see the virus circulating from time to time despite the MMR vaccine, especially among young adults or under 30 poorly vaccinated,"" according to epidemiologist Dr. Antoni Trilla.Trilla goes on to say that the virus is still circulating in Europe. ""In Romania there has been a recent outbreak with more than 2300 cases and 14 deaths,"" says Trilla. In France, one of the territories most affected by anti-virus movements, the situation has improved in recent years, but the virus is still active and causing new cases.Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, which affects mostly children. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards.There is no specific treatment for measles, and most people recover within 2-3 weeks. However, particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. Measles can be prevented by immunization.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Spain can be accessed at <http://www.map-of-spain.co.uk/large-map-of-spain.htmap>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Myanmar (Yangon)Date: Tue 14 Feb 2017Source: Eleven Myanmar [trans. May Aung Shwe, edited]<http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/local/7867>Medical workers administered vaccinations against measles in Kyimyintdine on 6 Feb [2017]. Children in most of Yangon Region's townships have been struck down with measles as outbreaks of the contagious disease spring up.The Yangon Region Department of Health said the disease had been recorded in 40 of the region's 44 townships.""But we are giving priority to 5 of these townships where there are dense populations, with a greater risk of the disease being more widespread,"" said an unidentified official from the health department.""Despite the high number of outbreaks, there have been no fatalities. In 5 townships where vaccinations took place, there are more than 600 places for where people can go to get injections against measles.""If people in a township are unaware of the situation on vaccinations in their place, they can go to health department outlets to get vaccinations. We expect to reach about 300 000 people with vaccinations.""In Yangon Region, the townships of Haling Tharyar, Insein, Twantay, Kyimyintdine and Tharketa have the most measles cases.""The health department began vaccinating in these townships on 6 Feb 2017 and will continue to do so until 20 Feb 2017,"" the health department official said.Every child under 15 must be vaccinated, the health department said.Myanmar suffered measles epidemics in 2011, 2012, and in 2013.Measles, a highly contagious respiratory infection, can cause a high fever, rash and flu-like symptoms. It is a leading killer of children, especially when they have other health ailments such as malnutrition.The Naga Self-Administered Zone in the northwest also reported a fresh outbreak of measles this year [2017].At least 40 people, nearly all of them children, have died from the disease in the remote, impoverished region, where there is little available healthcare.More than 200 people have come down with measles since mid-July 2016, when an epidemic swept through 5 villages in the mountainous Naga zone.[Byline: Ei Thinzar Kyaw]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Myanmar can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/myanmar_map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5388>. - Mod.LK]******[3] New ZealandDate: Tue 14 Feb 2017Source: Stuff [edited]<http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/89406941/ipu-measles-outbreak-likely-bought-in-from-overseas>A measles outbreak in Palmerston North likely came from overseas, a public health official says.Six cases have been confirmed at the Institute of the Pacific United New Zealand campus since 4 Feb 2017, cancelling classes until 20 Feb 2017.In the past week, one person had been hospitalised then discharged, medical officer of health Dr Rob Weir said. No new cases had been discovered by MidCentral DHB.""It is not known where the outbreak originated from. Measles is not endemic to New Zealand, so the infection will most likely have originated from overseas at some point,"" he said.About 87 per cent of IPU's students come from overseas.""All 6 patients have been released from quarantine and are doing well,"" Weir said.Measles carriers are highly contagious, and it can spread before symptoms arise, so isolation was still in place for those who did not have immunity, but had come into contact with one of those infected.All staff and students were asked to prove their immunity, and about 220 people were vaccinated at a pop-up clinic.""[Medical records have been] provided in many languages,"" IPU community liaison Joe Rush said. ""Our multi-lingual staff have helped the DHB with this.""Dining hall staff were making all meals takeaway, delivered by immune staff and students, and course material was available online and by email.Immigration NZ area manager Darren Calder said there were no specific vaccination requirements for international students, who are exempt from providing a medical certificate ""as they are required to hold full comprehensive medical insurance.""IPU and Massey University did not respond to questions about vaccination recommendations or requirements, but a UCOL spokeswoman said while they did not have existing requirements or recommendations, the outbreak had prompted the suggestion that students and staff check their immunity status.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of New Zealand may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>. - Mod.LK]******[4] Canada (Nova Scotia, Halifax)Date: Tue 14 Feb 2017Source: CBC News [edited]<http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/measles-public-health-symptoms-halifax-virus-viral-contagious-1.3982194>Public health officials in the Halifax area are trying to determine the source of 3 cases of measles, the 1st confirmed instances of the highly contagious illness in Nova Scotia since 2008.Dr. Trevor Arnason, medical officer of health for Halifax, Eastern Shore and West Hants, said it's rare to see cases of measles in Nova Scotia.""Measles has been eliminated within the province, so there isn't generally transmission here,"" he said Tuesday [14 Feb 2017]. ""So it's usually a traveller or someone who's linked to travel outside of the province or usually the country.""The 1st of the 3 new cases was confirmed 9 Feb 2017. All 3 of the cases are linked, and the people affected are known to each other. They all live in the Halifax area, but Arnason said they ""did travel somewhat within the province,"" meaning it's possible cases could pop up in other areas.Arnason would not identify the affected people, only to say they are young adults.""There isn't a particular group such as a daycare or a hospital setting specifically that we're concerned about,"" he said. ""But we're contacting the contacts of the 3 individuals at all the places they have been.""Arnason said it's not immediately clear how the trio became infected.""We couldn't find a travel connection,"" he said. ""We're exploring some possibilities of one of the individuals having travelled outside of the province. We're unsure if that is where it started, but we're going to continue to investigate that and make sure that there isn't another traveller or someone who has brought it in and made these individuals ill.""Measles is a viral illness that can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, sleepiness and irritability. People with the illness can also develop small white spots inside their mouths and throats, as well as red blotches on their face, that spread down the body.Most people fully recover within 2-3 weeks. However, measles can have serious complications for young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.People who've been vaccinated against measles can still fall ill, though Arnason says it is generally a milder illness.Before seeing a doctor, anyone with symptoms should call ahead to make sure the health-care provider is prepared to see a person with measles. ""The reason being because measles is so contagious it could be spread to other people waiting in the waiting room,"" Arnason said.[Byline: Sherri Borden Colley]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/271>.Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. It can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. Also, measles virus can live for up to 2 hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected [CDC]. For this reason, it is clear that even when a country has been declared measles-free, vaccination must be continued to maintain immunity in the population to protect individuals from imported virus. - Mod.LK]
