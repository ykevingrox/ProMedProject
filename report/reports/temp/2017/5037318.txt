Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-cholera-idUSKCN18A10M>Cholera has killed at least 180 people in Yemen in recent weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Mon 15 May 2017, a day after authorities declared a state of emergency in the capital Sanaa and called for international help.Sana'a is controlled by the armed Houthi movement, which is aligned with Iran and fighting a western-backed, Saudi-led coalition. More than 10 000 people have been killed and millions displaced in more than 2 years of war, which has also destroyed much of the country's infrastructure. Only a few medical facilities are still functioning, and 2/3rds of the population are without access to safe drinking water, the United Nations has said.Dominik Stillhart of the ICRC told reporters in the port city of Aden that at least 180 people had died from the acute diarrheal disease since 27 Apr 2017 and that 11 000 more suspected cholera cases had been reported across the impoverished country.Houthi authorities have said 115 of those who have died were in the city of Sana'a and its province. ""What is happening today exceeds the capabilities of any healthy health system, so how can we (cope) when we are in these difficult and complicated conditions,"" Saba news agency quoted the Houthi-run administration's health minister Mohammed Salem bin Hafeedh as saying.The ministry, after meeting in Sana'a with UN Humanitarian Coordinator Jamie McGoldrick and other international officials, called on humanitarian organizations and aid donors to help it avert an ""unprecedented disaster."" It declared a ""state of health emergency in the capital,"" the agency said.A cholera epidemic late in 2016 petered out, but outbreaks are becoming more frequent. Sana'a has been worst hit, followed by the surrounding province of Amanat al-Semah, WHO data has shown. Cases have also been reported in other major cities, including Hodeidah, Taiz and Aden. Some 17 million of Yemen's 26 million people lack sufficient food, and at least 3 million malnourished children are in ""grave peril,"" the UN has also said.[Byline: Muhammed Mukhashaf & Ali Abdelatti]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] State of Emergency declaredDate: Sun 14 May 2017Source: Al-Arabiya [edited]<http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2017/05/14/115-dead-as-Yemen-cholera-outbreak-spreads.html>Houthi militias in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a declared a state of emergency on Sun 14 May 2017 after an outbreak of cholera, which has killed dozens of people. Yemen's health ministry called on humanitarian organizations and other aid donors to help it deal with the epidemic and avert an ""unprecedented disaster.""The announcement comes just hours after earlier reports suggested that Houthi militias were preventing cholera patients from receiving medical treatments at the Republican Hospital in Sana'a. The Ministry of Health, speaking on behalf of the illegitimate government run by Houthis and Saleh forces, said on Sun 14 May 2017 that the hospital would stop receiving any cases of cholera in order to treat militants on the front lines 1st, sources confirmed.A cholera outbreak in war-torn Yemen has killed 115 people and left 8500 ill as hospitals struggle to cope with an influx of patients, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Sun 14 May 2017""We now are facing a serious outbreak of cholera,"" said ICRC director of operations Dominik Stillhart at a news conference in the capital Sana'a. Citing figures compiled by the Yemeni health ministry, Stillhart said that 115 people had died of cholera between 27 Apr-13 May 2017. More than 8500 suspected cases of the waterborne disease were reported in the same period in 14 governorates across Yemen, Stillhart said, up from 2300 cases in 10 governorates last week.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Sana'a prison casesDate: Sun 14 May 2017Source: Middle East Monitor [edited]<https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170514-yemen-cholera-outbreak-reported-in-sanaa-prison/>""Four people were transported to hospital from prison due to their deteriorating health condition,"" said Berman, a member of a government panel investigating human rights abuses. He cited the degrading of sanitation and health systems for the outbreak of the disease.Last week, the WHO said a cholera outbreak has killed 51 people in Yemen since April 2017. It said that there were 2752 suspected cholera cases, and 58 more people have been confirmed as having the diarrheal disease. On Sat 13 May 2017, UNICEF said 97 people have died of cholera and diarrhea outbreaks in war-torn Yemen [More up to date numbers for this rapidly growing epidemic can be found in the above posting. - Mod.LL].Yemen fell into civil war in 2014 after Houthi rebels overran Sana'a and other provinces. In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi gains and shoring up Yemen's pro-Saudi government. According to the UN, 11.3 percent of Yemen's population has been forcibly displaced by the conflict.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen>.The increasing numbers are as follows:Date [2017] / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 180The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press) oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
