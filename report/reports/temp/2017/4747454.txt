Usutu virus infections in humans: a retrospective analysis in the municipality of Modena, Italy.ObjectiveTo monitor the spread and to evaluate the role for public health of Usutu virus (USUV) in an endemic area of Italy.MethodsThe survey was retrospectively conducted by detecting USUV RNA and USUV antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples collected between 2008 and 2011 from 915 patients with or without neurologic impairments in the area of the municipality of Modena, Italy. Organs of birds and pools of mosquitoes were also tested for USUV RNA. Positive samples were partially sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis.ResultsThe presence of USUV RNA (1.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval (CI) 0.6-2.0) was significantly (p less than 0.05) higher than that of West Nile virus (0 percent; 95 percent CI 0-0.33). USUV antibody level was 6.57 percent (95 percent CI 4.87-8.82), and it was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) compared to that of West Nile virus (p 2.96, 95 percent CI 1.89-4.62). Partial genome sequencing of USUV strains detected in humans, birds and mosquitoes revealed high nucleotide sequence identity within them and with the USUV strains isolated in Central Europe.ConclusionsUSUV infection in humans is not a sporadic event in the studied area, and USUV neuroinvasiveness has been confirmed.--Communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[USUV infections in humans may be more prevalent than previously assumed.

Usutu virus, Belgium, 2016.Highlights- Usutu virus-associated mass mortality appeared in northwest Europe in this summer;- The causal virus was isolated and its genome sequenced;- The Usutu-LIEGE strain belongs to the Europe_3 lineage.AbstractDuring late summer 2016, in a northwest European region extending over Belgium, the Netherlands and the eastern border of the German state of North Rhine Westphalia, an outbreak of wild bird deaths occurred similar to those reported on the continent since 1996. Dead birds were necropsied and examined by complementary methods. Pathologic and immunohistological investigations strongly suggested an infection by Usutu virus. Subsequently, genomic segments of the said virus were detected, the virus was isolated and its complete genome was sequenced. The strain, designated Usutu-LIEGE, is a close phylogenetic relative of those isolated in Germany which form a distinct group within the USUV phylogeny, the so-called Europe_3 lineage. Should this outbreak recapitulate the characteristics of those in southwest Germany in 2011 and in/around Vienna (Austria) in 2001, it is expected that specific avian populations in the affected area will face a significant reduction in size for a few years.--Communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[It will be interesting to see if Usutu virus has become endemic in northern Europe with the risk of new cases when the transmission season begins in warmer months. One hopes that surveillance of mosquito vectors and dead birds for the presence of USUV will continue in 2017.

Mainly blackbirds (_Turdus merula_) are affected, but also increased numbers of great grey owls (_Strix nebulosa_) from aviaries in different zoos and wildlife parks have died from USUV infection.This is not the 1st time USUV has been detected in birds. In close cooperation with the State diagnostic agencies, the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM) and the Action group for mosquito control (KABS) the virus was detected from 2011-2015 in wild birds and birds kept in aviaries in Southwest Germany. The main epidemic area was located in the Upper Rhine Valley and the neighboring regions of the Palatinate and the Neckar Valley, single cases were also found in the area of Cologne (North Rhine-Westphalia). In 2015, 2 positive cases were 1st detected in the northeast of Germany, in 2 great grey owls (young animals) kept in an aviary in Berlin.This year [2016], USUV shows a very strong [transmission] activity and is widely distributed. Mainly the border triangle Germany-Netherlands-Belgium is affected, in North Rhine-Westphalia increased numbers are mainly found in the Lower Rhine area and the region around Aachen. Increased numbers of USUV-infected birds have also been found in the area around Leipzig. In addition to single USUV-positive birds in the known epidemic area in Southwest Germany along the Rhine from Freiburg to Cologne, further single cases have also been found in the area around Halle, Dresden, Berlin, and SaarbrÌ cken.Currently, extensive genetic investigations in cooperation with partners from Germany and other countries are ongoing to gain more information on the distribution of the different USUV strains in Germany.To increase the number of data, the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) supports the project, ""mosquito monitoring"", in Germany with emphasis on the early detection of mosquito-borne pathogens in Germany.Usutu virus originates from Africa (named after a river in Swaziland) and is transmitted by mosquitoes. Main hosts are wild birds which, as a rule, do not develop clinical disease. But also highly susceptible bird species are known, e.g. blackbirds which contract the infection very easily. Clinically, these infected birds often show apathy and central nervous disorders such as staggering and twisting of the head.--Communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[These reports provide additional evidence that USUV is spreading across Europe. There was an outbreak in Germany in 2011-2012. Originating from Africa in the summer of 2011, USUV virus was the cause of a mass die-off of blackbirds in south west Germany. Again in the summer of 2012, dozens of birds died and USUV was found in mosquitoes (_Culex pipiens_) in Germany.As Mod.AS noted in the ProMED-mail post [Usutu virus - Germany (02): birds, conf. 20110916.2827] of 16 Sep 2011, ""USUV 1st detection outside Africa took place in Vienna, Austria, in 2001, causing deaths in blackbirds (_Turdus merula_) and great gray owls (_Strix nebulosa_). In 2002, USUV was still circulating in Austria, demonstrating that USUV has managed to overwinter in a local bird-mosquito cycle in central Europe. More recently, USUV-specific RNA or antigen was also detected in birds or mosquitoes in Hungary, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. In the summer of 2009, USUV-related illnesses were reported in 2 immunocompromised patients in Italy. Antibodies were detected in UK in wild birds in 2002.""Usutu is a member of the mosquito transmitted flaviviruses belonging to the Japanese encephalitis virus group.ReferenceVazquez A, Jimenez-Clavero M, Franco L, et al: Usutu virus -- potential risk of human disease in Europe.

This demonstrated the potential impact of USUV new introductions upon hitherto virgin, susceptible bird populations (surveillance had been conducted in the Netherlands during earlier years with negative results).Reference---------Ashraf U, Ye J, Ruan X, et al: Usutu virus: an emerging flavivirus in Europe.
