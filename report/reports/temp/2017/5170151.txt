The Mighty [edited]<https://themighty.com/2017/07/france-vaccine-requirement/>France will require all parents vaccinate their children, French Prime Minister Ìädouard Philippe announced in a speech on Wed [5 Jul 2017]. The announcement follows a warning from the World Health Organization (WHO) that measles is spreading across Europe, despite vaccines which can prevent the virus, Independent reported.France currently requires all children to be vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and polio, and will add 8 more required vaccinations -- pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae bacteria, pneumococcus and meningococcus C -- starting in 2018.France is not the only country to have a rise in measles. In 2017, CNN reported 73 confirmed cases of measles in Minnesota, compared to 70 cases of measles in the entire U.S. in 2016, a majority of whom were unvaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is likely a result of anti-vaccination sentiments surrounding the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.""Measles is a dangerous and vaccine-preventable disease. There is no reason to decline MMR unless the individual is too young to be vaccinated or has a severe immunodeficiency and they cannot be vaccinated,"" Patricia Stinchfield, director of infection prevention and control for Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, told CNN. ""The reason we vaccinate is because of the potential for infection of the brain or lungs that can cause permanent and lasting damage. Death from measles is 1-2 per 1000 cases because there is no antiviral medicine against measles. All we can do is provide IV fluids, oxygen and support and hope they survive,"" she said. Many anti-vaxxers falsely claim the MMR vaccine causes autism spectrum disorder, a statement which has been repeatedly disproven.In 1998, the Lancet published a study which claimed autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. The publication then retracted the study in 2010 after scientists were unable to replicate its findings, and the study's author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license.France now joins Italy in mandating vaccines. In Italy, to attend a state-sponsored school, all children must be vaccinated.[Byline: Jordan Davidson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of France may be found at <http://bit.ly/2t5juKQ> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Romania and ItalyDate: Sun 9 Jul 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/romania-measles-cases-7600-italy-reports-2nd-measles-death-53203/>Europe has reported more than 14 000 measles cases since January 2016, including 35 deaths, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).While some 16 EU/EEA countries have reported outbreaks, 2 countries account for the vast majority of cases, Romania and Italy.In Romania, the total number of confirmed measles cases as of 7 Jul 2017 is 7647, including 31 deaths, according to the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases.

Overall, more than 14 000 cases have been reported in the EU/EEA since January 2016, including 35 deaths.The latest Communicable Disease Threats Report (CDTR) published by the European Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on 7 Jul 2017 provides the following updates on the current situation in the affected countries.Austria: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 30 Jun 2017, Austria has reported 79 cases, an increase of one case since the CDTR on 30 Jun 2017. This exceeds the cumulative number of cases reported in 2016.Bulgaria: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 6 Jul 2017, Bulgaria reported 161 cases. In the same period in 2016, Bulgaria reported one case.Germany: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 28 Jun 2017, Germany has reported 766 cases.

This is an increase of 209 cases since the previous CDTR on 30 Jun 2017. Cases are either laboratory-confirmed or have an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case. Infants and young children are the most affected group. 41 of the 42 districts have reported cases, Timis, in the western part of the country closest to the border with Serbia, is the most affected district with 1171 cases. Vaccination activities are ongoing in order to cover communities with suboptimal vaccination coverage.Spain: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 4 Jul 2017, Spain reported 137 measles cases, an increase of 8 cases since the previous CDTR on 30 Jun 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] IllinoisDate: Sat 8 Jul 2017Source: WDAY [edited]<http://www.wday.com/news/4294991-measles-outbreak-illinois-causes-concern-other-states>More and more cases of measles continue to spread across the country [USA]. This comes as 5 babies are believed to be infected just in Illinois alone, along with many others infected or quarantined across America.This outbreak is the latest in a disease thought to be eliminated in North America, and doctors say it could just get worse.""I think it's going to become a lot bigger than it is right now. There are pockets of communities where a lot of parents have decided not to vaccinate. Those are ticking time bombs,"" said one doctor.The CDC says measles is highly contagious, one person with the virus can spread it to another 18 people.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The pre-vaccination basic reproductive number, R0 (the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infective person in a totally susceptible population for measles) was estimated to be 11-18, the figure given above from the CDC. The effective basic reproductive number, R, takes into account vaccination coverage (2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine) and vaccine effectiveness of approximately 95%.With such an infectious virus as measles virus, outbreaks can only be prevented by high vaccination coverage. For an R0 = 11-18, the vaccination coverage required to prevent measles outbreaks is 96-99% (Plans-RubiÌ  P.
