He told Citi FM in an interview on [Thu 17 Aug 2017] post-mortems conducted on the deceased indicated they died from fish poisoning but could not ascertain whether it was as a result of eating the fish. He said the hospital had informed the Food and Drugs Authority about the development.""In all, the 2 communities where the people died, we have the samples but I cannot state categorically that it was as a result of the consumption of the fish until further investigation has been done. But I can state that we've lost 4 people as a result of eating the fish. Doctors' diagnosis said it was due to food poisoning.""""It is not a common fish on the market. What the residents told me was that when the fish is captured in the river and hit with a stick, it expands. It is not a normal fish that is sold on the market,"" he added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017Source: Pulse.com [edited]<http://www.pulse.com.gh/health/pufferfish-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-poisonous-fish-that-killed-4-in-volta-region-id7168042.html>When news broke on [Thu 17 Aug 2017] that 4 people had died in the Volta region after allegedly eating puffer fish, many have since been wondering what kind of fish that is.It is important to note puffer fish are highly poisonous and should only prepared by trained, licensed chefs who know one bad cut means almost certain death for a customer.Surprisingly, the meat of some puffer fish is considered a delicacy, especially in Japan.But here's why you should perhaps avoid it completely: - According to National Geographic, tetrodotoxin is deadly, up to 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide. One puffer fish has enough toxin to kill 30 adults. - The puffer fish is the 2nd most poisonous vertebrate on the planet. Its poison has no antidote and kills by paralyzing the diaphragm, causing suffocation. - Almost all puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin, a substance that makes them taste bad (and sometimes lethal) to other fish. - Tetrodotoxin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so the victims remain fully conscious while their central nervous system gradually shuts down. Symptoms such as numbness in the mouth, lips, and tongue occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours from an intake and after that, the victim begins to experience headaches, nausea and even vomiting. The rest of the body slowly becomes paralysed, causing death when the heart and lung muscles are also paralysed. - In Japan, the most lethal part, the liver, cannot be sold, and the whole fish is banned in the European Union. - There are more than 120 species of puffer fish worldwide. Most of them are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters. However, some species live in brackish and even fresh water. They have long, tapered bodies with bulbous heads. - The puffer fish protects itself in the wild by gulping down water and swelling up its belly to make itself look bigger. It does this because, apparently, it can't find a way to communicate the simple message, ""I am poisonous,""<io9.gizmodo.com> says[Byline: Mildred Europa Taylor]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>And Epicore member Addo Michael Brown[Tetrodotoxin is a colorless crystal substance that darkens when heated above 400 degrees F or approximately 220 C.Tetrodotoxin is an extremely potent toxin (poison) found mainly in the liver and gonads of some fish, notably puffer fish, or fugu, but also globefish (sometimes puffer fish are also called globefish), and toadfish as well as some amphibians, octopus, and shellfish species. Human poisonings occur when the flesh and/or organs of the fish are improperly prepared and eaten. Tetrodotoxin interferes with the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles and causes an increasing paralysis of the muscles of the body. Tetrodotoxin poisoning can be fatal.These creatures are likely fatal when prepared inappropriately, and should be handled with extreme caution for the everyday untrained person. We are sorry for the families of these individuals.Portions of this comment were extracted from: <https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750019.html>For more indepth comment, readers are referred to the moderator's comments on ProMED-mail posting Tetrodotoxin poisoning, puffer fish - China: (Hong Kong) 20160822.4432069. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16921>.]
