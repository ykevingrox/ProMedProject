Eurosurveillance Edition 2017, 22(6) [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22714>The 2016-17 mid-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates have also recently been published from North America.This includes estimates published by the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) indicating VE of 42 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval] 18 to 59) and from the United States Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (US Flu VE Network) indicating very similar VE of 43 percent (95 percent CI 29 to 54) against laboratory-confirmed, medically-attended outpatient illness due to the influenza A(H3N2) subtype that has dominated so far this season [2016/17] [1,2].These Canadian and US estimates are also similar to the VE of 38 percent (95 percent, CI: 21 to 51) against A(H3N2) illness reported by the I-MOVE European multi-centre case control study among primary care patients [3].Collectively, these mid-season VE estimates suggest the 2016-17 influenza vaccine reduced the risk of medically-attended A(H3N2) illness by about 40 percent, which although suboptimal is considerably better than reported by these same VE networks in mid- or end-of-season analyses for the last A(H3N2) epidemic that occurred in 2014-15 [4-8].Mid-season VE estimates and virological findings from both North America and Europe are being submitted alongside those available from other countries through the Global Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (GIVE) network to the World Health Organization in support of its February meeting to determine vaccine strain selection for the northern hemisphere's next 2017-18 season.References----------1.

However the authors in the study above conclude that it ""is considerably better than reported by these same VE networks in mid- or end-of-season analyses for the last A(H3N2) epidemic that occurred in 2014-15."" - Mod.UBA]
