She said they were diagnosed by Medicross at the Queens corner centre.""This was a 3-year-old boy and his sister of 6 years. They were diagnosed and referred to Eugene Marais hospital where they were admitted and treated,"" she said.""Our outbreak response unit contacted the parents and ascertained that the family did not travel to a malaria endemic area."" She said professors Lucille Blumberg and John Frean from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) were notified, and a team of experts visited Kilnerpark last Monday. ""A thorough investigation was done,"" she said. ""Mosquitoes and larvae were collected from the area and stream, but no indications of the _Anopheles_ malaria mosquito or larvae were found."" On 4 Oct 2017, Moot hospital reported 2 more malaria cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date:14 Oct 2017From: John Frean <johnf@nicd.ac.za> and Lucille Blumberg <lucilleb@nicd.ac.za> [edited]Malaria affecting persons with no recent history of travel to malaria transmission areas has been reported in Kilner Park, Pretoria (4 patients), and Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni (2 patients). Unfortunately, one patient died.It is most likely that _Anopheles_ malaria vector mosquitoes, accidentally transported by vehicles from malaria areas were responsible. This form of disease is called odyssean malaria, also known as airport, suitcase, minibus, or taxi-rank malaria.It is a rare condition (since 2007, 71 such cases, with 10 fatalities, have been recorded in South Africa), mostly in Gauteng province.Understandably, the absence of a travel history often leads to the diagnosis of malaria being delayed, with flu being most commonly assumed as the cause of illness. The mortality rate of 14% for these cases is substantially higher than the national average of less than 2%.The National Institute for Communicable Diseases is assisting the provincial and district Departments of Health investigations, and no evidence of temporary vector mosquito-breeding in the areas has been found. The occurrence of these cases does not mean that malaria is spreading to new areas in South Africa. Local residents, medical practitioners, hospitals, and laboratories have been alerted to the occurrence of odyssean malaria via the NICD website.Reference: Frean J, Brooke B, Thomas J, Blumberg L.
