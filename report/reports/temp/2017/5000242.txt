Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/monkeypox-case-reported-southern-sierra-leone-85930/>A 35-year old peasant farmer from Kpaku village, Galliness Perri chiefdom, Pujehun district in the southern region of Sierra Leone has been diagnosed with monkeypox, according to UN health officials.The patient developed ill-health on [Tue 14 Mar 2017]. He presented to a local health facility on [Thu 16 Mar 2017] with fever, body pain, malaise, dysphagia, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes; and was presumptively treated for malaria and sore throat as an out-patient.On [Fri 17 Mar 2017], he developed generalized vesicular skin eruptions in addition to the initial constitutional clinical features. The case-patient was admitted to Pujehun district hospital on [Sat 25 Mar 2017].Laboratory results from Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Kinshasha, DRC last week [week of 16 April 2017] indicated that the vesicular swab tested positive for Orthopox virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and monkeypox virus by GeneXpert technique. Based on these results, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health notified WHO on [Mon 17 Apr 2017] of the outbreak of monkeypox.A total of 13 close contacts to the index case were listed and are being followed up. None of them have developed any febrile illness and/or skin lesions in the 1st 21 days since the last exposure. The contacts are still being monitored for additional 21 days (twice the maximum incubation period of monkeypox).This is the 2nd sporadic occurrence of monkeypox in the country, with the 1st one reported in March 2014 in Bo district located in the southern region of the country.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Occurrence of sporadic cases is not surprising because monkeypox virus is endemic in West Africa, including Sierra Leone and human cases occur sporadically in the region.As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent, than the clade in West Africa, which causes few fatalities. The virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance of that in the Republic of the Congo. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ sp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>.]
