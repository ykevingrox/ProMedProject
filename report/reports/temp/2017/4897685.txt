EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]This information is confirmed by the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), not 2 but 3 died. I am quoting the NICD website here:""The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) was notified of 2 persons with malaria from Doornpoort, a suburb in the northern part of the City of Tshwane [Gauteng province], and 2 patients from Swartruggens in the North-West Province. None of these people had travelled to a known malaria transmission area. Unfortunately 3 of the patients passed away due to complications of malaria.""Source------Reported 'odyssean' malaria cases not linked to discovery of new malaria vector in South Africa, National Institute for Communicable Diseases<http://www.nicd.ac.za/?page=alerts&id=5&rid=728>--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberKris EalePublic Health SpecialistKhulisa[ProMED thanks Kris Eale, Public Health Specialist, Khulisa, for his comments. It is surprising that only fatal cases are reported. It would be expected to see more non-fatal cases compared to fatal cases. It is also unexplained how the 3 persons acquired _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in a presumed non-transmission area of South Africa with no known travel history. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179>.]
