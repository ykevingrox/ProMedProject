Bangalore Mirror [edited]<http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/news/state/h1n1-ravage-state-on-alert/articleshow/57723017.cms>Over 100 cases of jaundice have been reported from the Napoklu region of Kodagu district in 2017. Consumption of contaminated water has led to an increase in the cases of jaundice (approved cases of Hepatitis A), according to reports [unclear if approved means diagnosed cases - Mod.LL].While a spurt in jaundice cases came as a shock to the district health department, on investigation, it found that people were being forced to drink water that was not fit for drinking. This was because of scanty rainfall during the monsoon that has affected the Cauvery. People of Napoklu have started using water from open wells as a result. According to a team of health officials that visited the village, the panchayat was pumping and storing water in 3 tanks, but did not chlorinate or filter it.""When the department sent water samples for tests, it found that several of them were not potable. We conducted an intense campaign that included awareness programmes at schools, discussions at various levels, team visits and distribution of pamphlets. The panchayat officials were enlightened about providing safe water. The 3 tanks were sanitized,"" a health official said.[Byline: Deepthi Sanjiv]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The etiology of this presumed waterborne outbreak of hepatitis is stated to be type A but the cases are primarily in adults and if there are fatalities in pregnant women, type E viral hepatitis is likely the cause. - Mod.LLProMED-mail would greatly appreciate clarification of the etiology of this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55367>.]
