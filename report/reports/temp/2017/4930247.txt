Of those, 37 have been hospitalized, with 2 in serious condition. Normal operations at the hot spring have been suspended since [21 Mar 2017].According to the Hiroshima Prefectural Government, the man is thought to have used the facility in early March [2017], and was hospitalized with symptoms, including fever and difficulty breathing. _Legionella pneumophila_ has been detected in all of the people complaining of symptoms and at Miharashi Onsen's baths.--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.The news report above says that a legionnaires' disease outbreak associated with an onsen (Japanese hot spring) occurred in Mihara, Japan that involved 40 confirmed cases, with 37 hospitalized and 1 death. _Legionella pneumophila_ was detected in the onsen's bath and the onsen was closed on 21 Mar 2017.Maps of Japan can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/cities_of_japan_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59274>.Mihara, with an estimated population of 97 324 residents, is a city located in Hiroshima Prefecture (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihara,_Hiroshima>), which is located on Honshu island, Japan (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Prefecture>).Miharashi Onsen (or Mihara City Hot Spring) is an indoor and outdoor onsen, or hot spring in Mihara (<http://visithiroshima.net/things_to_do/attractions/hot_springs/miharashi_hot_spring.html>). There is also an adjoining ryokan (inn) with a hot spring bath in each guest room. This hot spring is said to have a water temperature of 45.1 deg C (113 deg F).Freely floating (planktonic) _Legionella_ grow over a wide range in temperatures, 25 to 45 deg C (77 to 113 deg F) in vitro. Warm water temperature is optimal for the growth of _Legionella_. However, _Legionella_ grow as a biofilm on the inner surfaces of warmer sections of the plumbing systems; the biofilm protects them from harsh conditions such as disinfectants and heat (<http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emerging/legionella.pdf>).Onsens are different from indoor public bathhouses where the baths are filled with heated tap water. However, all guests are expected to wash their bodies and rinse themselves thoroughly before entering the hot spring water.Japan has thousands of onsens throughout its major islands. Onsens use naturally hot water from geothermally heated springs. Onsen water, which is believed to have healing powers derived from its mineral content, is required by law ('onsenhou' or Hot Spring Law) to contain at least one of 19 designated chemical elements, including such minerals as iron, sulfur, and metabolic acid, and have an average temperature of 25 deg C (77 deg F) or warmer at the point of release (<http://www.hitou.or.jp/en/spateaching/spateaching01.html>). A particular onsen may feature several different baths, each with water of a different mineral composition.Legionnaires' disease outbreaks have been associated with onsens in the past (see also's below and <http://www0.nih.go.jp/JJID/63/78.pdf>). In 1997, the genotype of _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 3, isolated from an intratracheal specimen of a 71-year-old Japanese woman who developed pneumonia after nearly drowning in a hot spring spa bath, was reported to be identical to those of _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 3 strains isolated from the hot spring bath water (<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1348-0421.1997.tb01190.x/abstract>). In 2000, ProMED-mail in a post, reported an outbreak of legionnaires' disease involving 23 patients with 2 deaths, at a hot springs resort in Shizuoka, 94 miles (151 km) west of Tokyo (Legionellosis, public bath - Japan (Ibaraki) 20000628.1069). In 2002, 295 became ill and 7 died after contracting legionnaires' disease in an onsen in Hyuga, Miyazaki Prefecture; the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 was confirmed in 34; and _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 strains from 4 patients' sputa and several bath water specimens were determined to be genetically similar by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (<http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15675965> and ProMED-mail post 2002 Legionellosis - Japan (Miyazaki) 20020809.5001). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59274>.]
