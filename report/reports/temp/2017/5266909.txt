The most recent illness began on 31 Jul 2017.CDC and multiple states are investigating 10 separate multistate outbreaks of salmonella infections in people who had contact with live poultry in backyard flocks. These outbreaks are caused by several DNA fingerprints of different salmonella bacteria: _S._ Braenderup, _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Hadar, _S._ I 4,[5],12:i-, _S._ Indiana, _S._ Infantis, _S._ Litchfield, _S._ Mbandaka, _S._ Muenchen, and _S._ Typhimurium.The outbreak strains of salmonella have infected a reported 961 people in 48 states [only Alaska and Delaware have not reported cases - Mod.LL] and the District of Columbia. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 4 Jan 2017 to 31 Jul 2017.State / Number of CasesAlabama / 25Arizona / 6Arkansas / 9California / 54Colorado / 18Connecticut / 9DC / 1Florida / 43Georgia / 16Hawaii / 1Idaho / 10Illinois / 38Indiana / 7Iowa / 20Kansas / 13Kentucky / 39Louisiana / 15Maine / 3Maryland / 7Massachusetts / 7Michigan / 29Minnesota / 29Mississippi / 12Missouri / 28Montana / 18Nebraska / 16Nevada / 3New Hampshire / 7New Jersey / 3New Mexico / 14New York / 29N Carolina / 45N Dakota / 2Ohio / 50Oklahoma / 8Oregon / 20Pennsylvania / 26Rhode Island / 8S Carolina / 14S Dakota / 6Tennessee / 43Texas / 38Utah / 29Vermont / 14Virginia / 56Washington / 22West Virginia / 17Wisconsin / 24Wyoming / 10Total / 961215 ill people have been hospitalized. 1 death has been reported.Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings link the 10 outbreaks to contact with live poultry, such as chicks and ducklings, from multiple hatcheries. In interviews, 498 (74 per cent) of 672 ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before illness started.Contact with live poultry or their environment can make people sick with salmonellosis. Live poultry can be carrying salmonella bacteria but appear healthy and clean, with no sign of illness.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle, and they carry salmonella. 2 ways to minimize the risk: aggressive handwashing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. As has been pointed out by my colleague Mod.MHJ, it has become fashionable in the USA to have backyard poultry. So, this increase in human salmonellosis is not unexpected. From his personal professional epidemiological experience 50 years ago in the UK, such a rich variety of serotypes is typical of contaminated poultry feed. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
