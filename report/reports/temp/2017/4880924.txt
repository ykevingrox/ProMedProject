Herald [edited]<http://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/Monkey-fever-on-decline-in-Sattari/112316.html>With an extensive vaccination drive by the health department in Sattari, Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) that wreaked havoc in the taluka 2 years ago is on the decline. Dr Gajanan Naik, the health officer at Valpoi Community Health Centre [CHC], said that 90 people tested positive for KFD in the 1st 2 months of 2016. But this year, during the same period, that figure is down to 38, he pointed out.In the past 2 years, KFD has taken the lives of 4 people in Sattari. To save lives and prevent the spread of the disease, the health authorities are extensively working to immunize people. The data released by the Valpoi CHC revealthat a total of 335 persons [have] tested positive for KFD in Sattari, so far.Dr Naik said that the health department has carried out 40 rounds of vaccination drives in Sattari villages, so far. Besides, the health center is regularly vaccinating people visiting facility, where 8606 people have been vaccinated, so far. In 2015, 30 people tested positive for KFD with one death; in 2016, it was 267 with 3 deaths; this year [2017] 38 persons have tested positive so far, with no deaths. CHC is carrying out regular vaccinations at Valpoi centre on Tuesdays and Fridays. ""Next week we will be conducting the vaccination drives in the villages to reach out to larger population,"" Dr Naik said.He claims the number of KFD infected patients have come down due to the extensive vaccination which is supported by the Directorate of Health Services.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/51973>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJVaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been the primary strategy for controlling KFD. The strategy involves mass vaccination in areas reporting KFD activity (that is, laboratory evidence of KFD virus (KFDV) in monkeys, humans, or ticks) and in villages within a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius of such areas (<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/1/14-1227_article>). 2 vaccine doses are administered at least 1 month apart to people aged 7-65 years. Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination; thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=23359421&dopt=Abstract>).Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is a tickborne viral disease characterised by sudden onset of fever and/or headache followed by hemorrhagic manifestations such as conjunctival congestion, bleeding gums, epistaxis, haemoptysis (coughing up blood), haematemesis (vomiting blood) and melena (black, tarry stools) [1]. KFD was reported for the 1st time from Shimoga district of Karnataka state, India in 1957, and occurs as seasonal outbreaks during December to May when the nymphal activity of ticks in the forests is at its maximum.Prior to the currently used formalin-inactivated KFD virus (KFDV) vaccine produced in chick embryo fibroblasts, several vaccines were tested for the control of the disease. These included 5-10 per cent suspension of formalin-inactivated Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus [2], formalin inactivated vaccine from mice brain [3], as well as tissue culture source [4] and a live attenuated vaccine through serial tissue culture passages [5]. Field studies conducted in 1970-71 with the formolized KFDV demonstrated a serological response in 59 per cent of the vaccinees after 2 doses [6-7].To control KFDV, systematic efforts are needed to improve the current vaccine and vaccine coverage. Current vaccination strategies should be periodically reviewed and the reasons for low vaccine effectiveness should be evaluated.References----------1. Work TH, Roderiguez FR, Bhatt PN.
