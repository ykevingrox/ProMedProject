""We have no information that anybody else has been exposed or is at risk.""Legionnaires' disease is caused by the bacteria _Legionella_. Symptoms include fever, cough, chills, muscle aches, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion and diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 10 days after significant exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria. Most cases of Legionnaires' disease can be traced to plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for _Legionella_ growth, such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks, and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems.Legionnaires' disease cannot be spread from person to person. Groups at highest risk for Legionnaire's disease include people who are middle-aged or older, especially cigarette smokers, people with chronic lung disease or weakened immune systems and people who take medicines that weaken their immune systems (immunosuppressive drugs).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), located at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA)-Fort Sam Houston, is the United States Army's largest and busiest medical center; it includes the Army's largest in-patient hospital, the San Antonio Military Medical Center, a 425-bed facility, expandable to 653 beds in the event of disaster (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Army_Medical_Center#SAMMC_2>).
