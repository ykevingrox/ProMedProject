SunSentinel, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]<http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/sns-bc-fl--florida-keys-screwworm-infestation-20170318-story.html>The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services says it will wind down its response against flesh-eating maggots that threaten small, endangered deer in a national wildlife refuge in the Florida Keys.The department said in a news release that the check point for New World screwworms in Key Largo will close at 7 p.m. [Sat 18 Mar 2017]. This comes after more than 5 months of aggressive response efforts and no new screwworm infestations found since [10 Jan 2017].New World screwworm can eat livestock and pets alive, and once cost the US livestock industry millions every year. There hadn't been a US infestation in over 30 years, until agriculture officials confirmed in September [2016] that screwworm was killing the dog-sized Key deer whose range is limited to a national wildlife refuge.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 23 Mar 2017Source: United States Animal Health Association (USAHA) [edited]<http://www.usaha.org/Home/NewsAlerts.aspx#NEWS1>USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing the successful eradication of the New World screwworm (NWS) from Florida.""I want to personally thank our many collaborating partners at the Federal, State, and local levels,"" said Dr Jack Shere, USDA Chief Veterinarian. ""Through their dedication and professionalism close to 154 million sterile flies have been released, 16 902 animals have been inspected at checkpoints, and almost 430 hours of active surveillance in the Keys and 250 hours of active surveillance on the mainland have been completed. Their tireless work has allowed us to eliminate New World screwworm from the United States once again.""Animal health checkpoints, or interdiction stations, were closed on [Sat 18 Mar 2017]. The last sterile fly releases in Homestead, Florida took place on [Tue 22 Mar 2017] and fly releases are scheduled to end on [25 Apr 2017] in the Florida Keys.APHIS considers an area to be screwworm-free through surveillance which includes trapping flies and visually inspecting animals for signs and symptoms of NWS infestation. No new cases of NWS have been reported in Florida since [10 Jan 2017]. Science shows that, when sterile flies are released, elimination of NWS is achieved 3 life cycles after the last detection. The flies have on average, a 21-day life cycle, and they continue to circulate in the area for 3 weeks beyond each release. In the Keys, APHIS will complete 5 life cycles beyond the last positive screwworm detection. Out of an abundance of caution, APHIS also released flies in the Homestead area for 3 completed life cycles.APHIS and Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) will continue passive surveillance to ensure any new findings are quickly identified. This surveillance includes veterinarians reporting any suspicious cases, wildlife surveillance, concerned citizens that see suspicious wounds on animals or even on a person, and continued communication with the parks and the National Key Deer Refuge.APHIS began releasing sterile flies in October 2016, as part of aggressive eradication effort undertaken in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, FDACS, and local partners.

No mean achievement and efficiently pulled off. This is the 1st stage of this battle. We have yet to hear where these flies came from and what is being planned to prevent a repetition. I think we should keep this thread open until we are persuaded there will be no repetition. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20092>.]
