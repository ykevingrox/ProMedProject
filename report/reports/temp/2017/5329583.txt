Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/provincias/alerta-sanitaria-tras-confirmacion-de-caso-de-hantavirus-en-veraguas-1083858>The person confirmed as positive for [a] hantavirus is currently improving, although remains in an intensive care unit.Authorities say that it is important to adopt sanitary measures for prevention of hantavirus [infections]. A health alert has been issued for health units, after the Dr. Luis ""Chicho"" FÌÁbrega Veraguas Regional Hospital, reported that a 67 year old man from the Almadano community, Soledad subdistrict of the SonÌÁ district, tested positive for [a] hantavirus [infection].Ruth Medina, Regional Director of the Ministry of Health (MINSA) in Veraguas said early this [Tue 19 Sep 2017] morning that another person from the same community was reported with apparent symptoms and tests are underway. [Byline: MelquÌ ades VÌÁsquez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although specific dates of hospitalization of the affected man are not given, nor is his clinical condition described, the impression from this report is that his infection was hantavirus fever and had not progressed to the serious hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The situation under which the man acquired the infection is not mentioned, nor is there an indication if the Ministry of Health or provincial health authorities have, or will, undergo an epidemiological investigation in the area where the man acquired the infection.There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments from previous posts, Veraguas province and it adjoining provinces of Los Santos and Herrera are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12644> and a map showing the location of Veraguas province at <http://www.turkey-visit.com/panama-map-province>. - Mod.TY]******[2] USA (Nevada)Date: Tue 19 Sep 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/nevada-hantavirus-case-reported-south-reno-80937/>Washoe County (NV) health officials are reporting the 1st human hantavirus case since 2006. The patient is a resident of south Reno.""Hantavirus[es are] transmitted by rodents, most likely the common deer mouse in our area,"" said Washoe County District Health Officer Kevin Dick. ""People should be very cautious when cleaning, working, or recreating in areas where mouse droppings and/or urine may have collected and become aerosolized by cleaning, sweeping, vacuuming, or tramping. It's when those particles are breathed in that people are at risk for contracting the virus,"" Dick said.Campers, hunters, and hikers may also be at risk if they are in areas where heavy rodent infestation is common, such as old cabins, barns, sheds and campsites. People pulling out holiday decorations from garages and storage units may also find signs of rodent activity, and should take precautions.Since 1993, more than 700 hantavirus cases have been reported in the US.Hantavirus is extremely rare, and can be deadly. Statistics show a 38 percent case fatality rate for humans infected by the disease which affects the lungs. Flu-like symptoms that can appear 1 to 8 weeks after exposure can include muscle aches, particularly in the large muscle groups of the thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a ""...tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face"" as the lungs fill with fluid.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The hantavirus involved in this, and doubtless earlier cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. No clinical information is provided for the case above or if it is HPS, nor is there any information about the circumstances under which this infection was acquired.Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (<https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html>).Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus.
