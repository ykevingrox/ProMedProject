Brandon Sun [edited]<http://www.brandonsun.com/world/breaking-news/south-sudan-15-children-die-in-botched-vaccine-campaign-425879753.html?thx=y>A total of 15 young children have died in a botched measles vaccination campaign that saw people as young as 12 years old administering the vaccines, South Sudan's government announced [on Fri 2 Jun 2017]. The United Nations said the children died of ""severe sepsis/toxicity"" from the contaminated vaccine, and the health ministry blamed the deaths on human error. One syringe was used for all the children during the 4-day campaign, and the vaccine was stored without refrigeration the entire time.Measles is yet another challenge facing the desperately poor East African country that already has been devastated by more than 3 years of civil war and a recently declared famine, as well as a cholera outbreak.The government said all of the children who died were under the age of 5. It is setting up a commission to determine who is responsible and whether victims' families will be compensated. The measles vaccination campaign is targeting more than 2 million children across the country. About 300 children were targeted in the area where the children's deaths occurred.The children died in the rural town of Kapoeta in early May [2017]. Another 32 children suffered fever, vomiting and diarrhea but recovered, a joint statement by the World Health Organization and the UN children's agency UNICEF said.Abdulmumini Usman, the South Sudan country director for WHO, told The Associated Press earlier this week [week of 28 May-3 Jun 2017] that even after the organization became aware of the deaths, the measles campaign continued across the country except in Kapoeta. ""This campaign is lifesaving,"" Usman said.WHO provides some training to South Sudan's health officials and the UN children's agency provides the vaccines to the government. It was not immediately clear whether any UN officials were present at the time of the botched vaccinations. The joint statement by WHO and UNICEF said the vaccination team involved in the deaths was ""neither qualified nor trained."" It called the deaths a ""tragic event"".Dr Samson Baba, an immunization official in the Ministry of Health, refused to comment on the deaths earlier this week [week of 28 May-3 Jun 2017], instead demanding the source of the information. South Sudan's government on [Fri 2 Jun 2017] also said vaccinations are not being denied to any part of the country, including those held by opposition forces.The civil war has killed tens of thousands and sent more than 1.8 million people fleeing the country, creating the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis. In 2016, South Sudan had at least 2294 measles cases and 28 people died, according to UN data. So far this year [2017], at least one person has died and 665 people have been infected. Friday's UN statement said the risk of measles in the country remains ""extremely high"".[byline: Justin Lynch and Sam Mednick]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is an unfortunate setback to the vaccination campaign and tragic loss of children's lives in this troubled country that desperately needs improved child health, although it is impressive that more than 2 million children are being targeted in this campaign. Why untrained individuals were giving the vaccinations is not clear; the 2 infractions, lack of refrigeration and repeated use of needles, are likely a result of ignorance of proper procedures. Thus education of health care workers is imperative.[A map of South Sudan can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402>. - Mod.LK]******[2] RomaniaDate: Tue 30 May 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/romania-measles-outbreak-update-27th-possible-death-investigated-23322/>In a follow-up on the large measles outbreak in Romania, the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (computer translated) puts the outbreak case count at 6434 confirmed cases since last September [2016].The number of measles-related fatalities is confirmed at 26, with a 27th possible death still being investigated in Dolj. The breakdown of measles deaths by county is as follows: Timis (8), Arad (5), Dolj (5), Caras Severin (3), and one each in Bihar, Calarasi, Satu Mare, Vaslui and Bucharest.Measles vaccination status is at the heart of the epidemic problem in Romania. According to a Digi 24 report (computer translated), 7 per cent of parents refuse vaccination, and one in 3 families are unable to reach the doctor or get the vaccine. In the past 10 years, the immunization rate in Romania has dropped from 95 per cent to 86 per cent, and for some diseases like measles, only half the population is vaccinated in certain counties.Romanian authorities have started a pro-vaccination and immunization program allocated the highest amount to date: 153 EUR [USD 172.62]. [According to <http://www.romania-insider.com/measles-outbreak-still-major-problem-romania/>, Romanian authorities bought 109 000 doses of anti-measles vaccine.]Alexandru Rafila, president of the Romanian Society for Microbiology, said: ""In several counties, especially those in the west, where the epidemic is evolving the fastest, vaccination coverage is only about 50 per cent. It is very worrying. There is interest, now we need to solve other issues that may be bureaucratic public procurement legislation needs to be improved.""[byline: Robert Herriman]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Note the increase in number of cases from 6124 from last report 22 May [2017] to 6434 in this current report.See a map of Romania at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122> - Mod.LK]******[3] Canada (Nova Scotia)Date: Mon 29 May 2017Source: Anapolis County Spectator [edited]<http://www.annapoliscountyspectator.ca/news/local/2017/5/29/measles-case-confirmed-at-valley-regional-hospital-in-kentville-.html>Until this year, there had been no confirmed cases of measles in Nova Scotia since 2008. ""We did have a case confirmed that was tested at Valley Regional last week [week of 21-27 May 2017],"" said Dr Trevor Arnason, medical officer of health.He said for every confirmed case, health officials immediately try to identify who could have been exposed by identifying where the victim was at the time they would have been infectious to others. ""From that, we identify who the highest risk groups are that would require vaccination as quickly as possible,"" Arnason said May 29 [2017]. ""So if you provide vaccination within 3 days of the exposure there is a good chance you can abort the infection -- stop it from establishing and prevent someone from getting infected with measles.""That means from the moment of diagnosis, health officials have to act quickly. They're looking for immunocompromised people, pregnant women and very young children who may have been at the same hospital -- or even in the same store or gas station as the confirmed case.""Some of those individuals can't receive the vaccine because it's a live virus vaccine, so we give them something called immunoglobulin, which is basically like an active form of the vaccine or the antibodies which are made from human [serum] from another person -- and that protects them against measles,"" he explained. The infection rate is high among unvaccinated populations, Arnason said. In fact, if a person infected with measles walked into a room of 10 unvaccinated people, 9 of those people would become infected.""There were exposures last week [week of 21-27 May 2017] at the hospital, so we've been following up with a number of people who were at the hospital who may have been exposed in those high-risk groups -  to offer them vaccine or immunoglobulin,"" Arnason said.The doctor said the Kentville patient was placed into a negative pressure room as per protocols.Sick childBecause of privacy issues, Arnason would not confirm if the measles case at Valley Regional Hospital was the same person as detailed in a Facebook post from an Annapolis County woman on 26 May [2017].The mother of a small child became concerned about her son's health as far back as 18 May [2017] and said she took him to Annapolis Community Health Centre 22 May with high fever, rash and dehydration. He was isolated because it appeared he had measles but was not diagnosed because he didn't have all the symptoms and had both of his measles vaccinations.The child was sent home and prescribed Benadryl [an antihistamine] and Tylenol [paracetamol/acetaminophen]. He was worse on 23 May and the mother took him to Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville, where she was again told it was not measles and the same treatment was again prescribed. She said they were being sent home again but she refused, demanding blood work and fluids for dehydration. When the doctor seemed hesitant, the mother said she demanded to see a pediatrician -- who had the child tested for measles.The mother described the child being unable to see as he was giving a urine sample and was rushed to ICU. The diagnosis was Kawasaki disease, an immune condition that is not contagious and not a reportable disease. The child spent the night in the hospital and was feeling better the next day, 25 May, when the measles diagnosis was confirmed. Because measles is an airborne disease, the child was put in a negative pressure room until he was no longer contagious, the mother said.It turned out he had Kawasaki disease and measles at the same time. The mother refused to take him home until tests came back normal.VaccinationMeasles vaccinations work extremely well, said Arnason, noting that one vaccination is about 93 per cent effective and after 2 vaccinations, it is 97 per cent effective. But there's still that 3 per cent chance.How did the Kentville case contract the measles?""That's a good question,"" said Arnason. ""That's what we're investigating in public health now. We are currently in a measles outbreak that is centered around the western part of the province."" He thinks the Kentville patient's condition is connected to that outbreak. Because measles is so contagious, it can at times be transmitted by casually passing somebody in a hallway or on the street, ""So we haven't identified the exact link yet and that's what we do in our investigation.""For all of our 32 cases that we've had in the province this year [2017], we've been able to identify a link eventually,"" he said. ""But I can't say for sure whether we will in this case. But that's the question top of mind for us as well is figuring out where this transmission might have occurred and how it might have occurred.""He said if there's another case out there that they don't know about, the health department needs to find it and do the appropriate follow-up, get people vaccinated, and prevent it from spreading.[byline: Lawrence Powell]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Nova Scotia, Canada, can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/271>]
