East County Magazine [edited]<http://goo.gl/LngRfZ>After numerous residents on the Mt Helix Next Door forum complained of swarms of small, aggressive mosquitoes biting during daylight hours and often, indoors, East County Magazine [ECM] contacted County Vector Control. We learned that the invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes have been found in 273 traps at 23 different locations between 1 Jan-21 Sep this year [2017]. View map [<http://goo.gl/pZDbze>].These non-native mosquitoes can transmit Zika virus, yellow fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya [viruses] if they first bite a returning traveler infected with one of these diseases [viruses], which have not been found recently in California. According to the US Centers for Disease Control, they can also carry West Nile virus, though it's more commonly transmitted in the San Diego region by our native _Culex_ mosquitoes._A. aegypti_ and/or _A. albopictus_ mosquitos have been found as far east as Lakeside, as far north as Oceanside, and as far south as the international border, with clusters in San Diego, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Mt Helix, Santee [San Diego county], and many other communities.County Vector Control will conduct an inspection for any resident who requests help to identify the breeding source of _Aedes_ mosquitoes. ""Since they are likely only to fly 150 meters [500 ft.], the sources are often very close to where they are observed,"" Jessica Northrup, [San Diego] county communications spokesperson, told East County Magazine in an email today [2 Oct 2017]. ""We encourage all residents to dump any standing water inside or outside of their house, which can serve as a mosquito breeding site.""The County will not conduct an adult mosquito control program, however, unless there is an elevated risk of a mosquito-borne disease, Northrup said, adding that no such risk at been identified at this time.Public health hazard or not, the aggressive mosquitos are making life miserable for some East County [region of San Diego county] residents.""These mosquitoes are new and they suuuuuuuck. Literally,"" says EP of the La Mesa Grossmont Summit area, who confirmed to ECM that Vector Control identified the _Aedes_ mosquitos plaguing her property. She says he suggested she purchase ""Mosquito Bits"" for plants and bird baths as a biological control. ""Yay! So far, much better. Gave it to my neighbors, too. They're all on board,"" she posted on the Mount Helix forum.[The article includes several additional complaints from residents in the area.]The mosquitoes can breed in as little as a thimbleful of water, so its important to dump out all standing water and change water bowls for any outdoor pets daily. The county offers free mosquito fish for ponds and has a hotline to report green pools or other sources of standing water.Here are more tips to avoid being bitten:- put screens on windows and doors. (Invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes can live and breed inside homes);- wear long sleeves and pants;- invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes are aggressive biters both indoors and outdoors, especially during the day;- apply insect repellent containing DEET, oil of lemon eucalyptus, picaridin, or IR3535 to exposed skin (always use as directed on product label)- find the insect repellent that is right for you (United States Environmental Protection Agency search tool; <https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you>).[Byline: Miriam Raftery]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has received where local residents in Southern California are complaining of ""swarms"" of _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The risk of introduction of one of the mentioned viruses into the local mosquito population may be low, but it is not zero. As of 27 Sep 2017, there have been 25 cases of Zika virus infections imported into California so far this year (2017). Clearly, an aggressive public education campaign is needed in the areas where there are abundant _Aedes_ populations in order to enlist the local residents in the elimination of breeding sites. This is unlikely to eliminate the mosquitoes, but will reduce their numbers, and with that, reduce the risk of ongoing virus transmission.The map cited in the report above shows the locations of trap sites where _Aedes_ mosquitoes have been captured in San Diego county.The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/787>.
