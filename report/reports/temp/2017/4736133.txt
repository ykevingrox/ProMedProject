The outpatient showed signs and symptoms of infection of the tissues near a fingernail (panaritium).Swabs taken on the day of admission in hospital A and on day 7 in hospital B, yielded toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. On 30 Dec 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Reference Centre for Diphtheria and Streptococcal Infections at Public Health England (PHE), London, United Kingdom, confirmed the isolate as toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ (positive also by Elek test).It has long been recognized that _C. diphtheriae_ can cause clinical skin infections [Euro Surveill. 2014; 19(26): pii=20845; <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20845>]. Skin carriage of _C. diphtheriae_ can act as a silent reservoir for the organism, and it has been found that person-to-person spread from infected skin sites is even more efficient than from the respiratory tract in causing classical respiratory diphtheria [J Infect Dis. 1975;131(3): 239-44; <http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/3/239.abstract>].The carriage of tox-positive lysogenic _C. diphtheriae_ also poses a risk that non-toxigenic strains, which are regularly found in Austrian residents, could become lysogenized by introduction of a beta-phage-bearing strain.We would like to point out that travel -- and as previously shown migration -- to and from countries where diphtheria is endemic may still pose a risk for re-emergence of the disease, which emphasizes the importance of proper diphtheria vaccination.--Franz Allerberger and Alexander IndraDiphtheria Reference CentreAustrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES)ViennaAustria<Franz.Allerberger@ages.at>[ProMED-mail thanks Franz Allerberger and Alexander Indra for their contribution on cutaneous diphtheria.For a discussion of cutaneous diphtheria, please see my and my colleague moderator LL's comments in the ProMED-mail posts listed below. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/144>.][See Also:2015----Diphtheria - Europe: cutaneous, refugees 20150815.35794622014----Diphtheria - Norway ex Mozambique: cutaneous, traveler 20140621.2556752].................................................ml/mj/lm"
