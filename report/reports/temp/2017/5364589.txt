R7 [in Portuguese, machine trans; summ, edited]<http://noticias.r7.com/saude/sao-paulo-vive-surto-de-hepatite-a-duas-mortes-sao-confirmadas-05102017>According to data released by the Municipal Health Department on Wed 4 Oct 2017, the city of Sao Paulo is having, in 2017, an outbreak of hepatitis A. Between 1 Jan 2017 and 16 Sep 2017, the capital recorded 517 cases of the disease -- already an increase of more than 700 percent over the whole of 2016, when there were 64 cases. The State Department of Health, in turn, reports that in Sao Paulo state, 394 cases of hepatitis A were notified by the 2nd week of August 2017. In 2016, there were 154 cases.According to Flavia Jacqueline Almeida, an infectious diseases pediatrician and assistant professor in the Pediatric Department of the FCMSC-SP (Faculty of Medical Sciences of Santa Casa de Sao Paulo), the outbreak of hepatitis A in Sao Paulo is related to the homosexual population: the epidemiological bulletin reports that about 87 percent of the notifications -- 452 cases -- in Sao Paulo occurred among male patients aged between 18 and 39. Infections occurred predominantly among men who have sex with other men,"" explains the specialist.In Europe, many countries have started offering hepatitis A vaccine to all persons after an outbreak. This would undoubtedly be an effective strategy in Brazil, but we know that promoting these public health measures requires logistics, campaigns, and vaccines available.[Byline: Ana Luisa Vieira]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>viaProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al. Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at <http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract>), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:- men who have sex with men;- people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs;- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LLMaps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3861>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
