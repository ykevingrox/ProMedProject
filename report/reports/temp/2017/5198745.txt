ABC Andalucia Cordoba [in Spanish, machine trans. edited]<http://sevilla.abc.es/andalucia/cordoba/sevi-doce-trabajadores-covap-contagian-brucelosis-sacrificio-oveja-infectada-201707212000_noticia.html>Covap [La Cooperativa Ganadera del Valle de los Pedroches] reported on Friday [21 Jul 2017] that 10 workers belonging to the company TAIC, an associate cooperative that provides services at the center, have tested positive for brucellosis and have a symptomatology compatible with the disease, with episodes of recurrent fever. In addition to these 10 cases, 2 previous cases were diagnosed last May [2017].The company stated that ""everything indicates that the infection occurred last April [2017?] during the slaughter of sheep from a mutton-producing farm,"" in which sanitary slaughter was carried out in the middle of that month. They stated that there is ""absolute control"" over the source focus of this case.Brucellosis is a livestock disease. Human infection occurs by contact with fluids from an infected animal, in this case sheep. According to Covap, transmission of the disease from person to person does not occur; infection routes are oral, nasal, ocular, and through skin injuries, cuts or wounds.Currently, brucellosis mainly affects people involved in the management of livestock: breeders, veterinarians and slaughter line staff in slaughterhouses. ""Contamination is very rare outside the workplace, and there is no risk in the food chain,"" the company concludes.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Spain is one of 5 EU member states engaged for years in the eradication of _Brucella melitensis_ with EC financial support; the others are Croatia, Greece, Italy, and Portugal.The infection rate in Spain's animals has been consistently decreasing, in tandem with human infection, which has been reported to the OIE since 2005 as follows:2005 - 3282006 - 3242007 - 2462008 - 1602009 - 1522010 - 1062011 - 1002013 - 1032014 - 792015 - 54Spain presented its 2016 _B. melitensis_ situation on 8 Jun 2017 in Brussels, which follows:""Spanish National Eradication Programme on Sheep and Goat Brucellosis 2016. Results and evolution;"" see at<https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20170608_brucellosis_eradication_spain.pdf>.The presentation includes a curve demonstrating the evolvement of the disease since 1991 (slide 8). During 2016, 5 of Spain's 17 regions were still infected, led by Andalucia, the region in which the above described event has taken place.The seroprevalence in small ruminants (sheep and goats) was the following (in percentages): Andalucia 0.24, Castilla La Mancha 0.10, Castilla Y Leon 0.04, Cataluna 0.03, Galicia 0.02.(slide 9).The hazardous, infected organs of animals during slaughter are mainly the genitalia, particularly in pregnant animals, and udders in lactating animals. It would be interesting to obtain some information on the age and sex of the slaughtered animals that infected the COVAP's abbatoir personnel, and the exact reason for their sanitary slaughter (serology-based?). Assuming that the patients suffered infection by _B. melitensis_, laboratory confirmation and details on the biovar involved will be helpful.A detailed recent review, ""Treatment of Human Brucellosis -- Review of Evidence from Clinical Trials,"" based upon multinational sources, authored by Julian Solis Garcia del Pozo and Javier Solera, is available at <http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/61223>. - Mod.AS][Despite COVAP's assertion to the contrary, person-to-person transmission can occur although it is rare: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3327908/> and <https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/51/2/e12/304370>.
