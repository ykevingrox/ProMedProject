Authorities say the deer mouse is the main carrier of the hantavirus strain found in New Mexico.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[New Mexico health authorities said above that the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) is the main carrier of the hantavirus strain found in New Mexico without mentioning the name of the virus. The hantavirus involved in this, and doubtless earlier cases in New Mexico, is Sin Nombre virus. This fatality was probably due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. The specific circumstances under which the woman acquired her Sin Nombre virus are not mentioned. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Department of Health recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of McKinley county, New Mexico can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/15880> and a map showing the location of Lincoln County in New Mexico at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20705>. - Mod.TY]
