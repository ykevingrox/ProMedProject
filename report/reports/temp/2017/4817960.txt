Cal Coast News [edited]<https://calcoastnews.com/2017/02/deaths-slo-county-valley-fever-rise/>In the 1st month of 2017, there have been 26 confirmed cases of Valley fever in San Luis Obispo County [California] and 2 deaths. Over the past 8 years, the number of confirmed cases has more than doubled.In 2009 there were 87 reported cases in San Luis Obispo County. Last year [2016], there were 220 confirmed cases of Valley fever and 5 deaths.The disease is spread by a fungus that grows naturally in portions of Arizona and California. In the past, most cases of Valley fever were found in the Central Valley. Now, San Luis Obispo County [a county on the Pacific coast] is becoming a hot spot. In contrast, in 2016 Santa Barbara County [a county on the Pacific coast immediately south of San Luis Obispo County] reported only 56 cases of Valley fever.Most people who breathe in the spores develop no symptoms at all. Others, about 40 percent, develop flu-like symptoms including cough, congestion, fever, fatigue, body aches, and headaches that can last a month or more. Valley fever can lead to severe pneumonia, meningitis, and death.The Mayo Clinic's website (<http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/basics/prevention/con-20027390>) advises people in areas with the spores to be aware of the symptoms. With treatment at the 1st sign of symptoms, most people will recover without problems.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the southwestern United States (mainly the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, but also Nevada, Utah, and Washington state), parts of northern Mexico, and in Central and South America. It is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_ and _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow in the top 2-8 inches (5 to 20 cm) of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. The airborne spores then can travel great distances by currents of air. The airborne spores can be inhaled and produce an acute infection in humans, as well as other animals.The California counties of Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, and San Luis Obispo are the _Coccidioides_-endemic areas; these counties had the highest annual average incidence rates for coccidioidomycosis, and their cumulative cases represent 76 per cent of all cases reported from California for the years 2001-2011 (<http://vfce.arizona.edu/sites/vfce/files/the_epidemiology_of_coccidioidomycosis_collaborative_county_report.pdf>).
