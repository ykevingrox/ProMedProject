Emerg Infect Dis. 2017;23(9):1609-1611.<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/9/17-0523_article>Antimicrobial drug-resistant Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ infections, Michigan, USA---------------------------------------------------------------------Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ - EHEC - Mod.LL] contributes to 265 000 cases of foodborne illness annually in the USA (1). Most infections are caused by O157 strains; however, non-O157 EHEC infections have increased (2). Antimicrobial drug resistance among EHEC has been reported (3-5) but is probably underestimated. Given the importance of resistance in _E. coli_ pathotypes, we sought to determine the prevalence of resistant EHEC infections and assess the effects of resistance on disease.We obtained 358 STEC isolates from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Reference Laboratory (Lansing, MI, USA), collected during 2010-2014. Of these, 14 were outbreak associated. We examined one strain per outbreak using protocols approved by Michigan State University and MDHHS. Overall, 31 (8.8 per cent) strains (23 non-O157, 8 O157) were resistant to antimicrobial drugs (table [for table and figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Resistance to ampicillin (7.4 per cent) was the commonest, followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (4.0 per cent) and ciprofloxacin (0.3 per cent). Compared with national rates, resistance to ampicillin and SXT was higher, but not significantly different, for O157 isolates from Michigan (figure 1) (6). One strain was resistant to all drugs, and all resistant strains had high MICs (ampicillin, >64 ug/mL; ciprofloxacin, >32 ug/mL; SXT, in 1:19 ratio, >32/608 ug/mL). Notably, resistance was twice as common for non-O157 (11.1 per cent) than for O157 (5.5 per cent) strains. O111 strains (n=7) had significantly higher resistance frequencies (24.1 per cent) than other non-O157 serogroups (p=0.03). We found variation by year and season; resistance frequencies were highest in 2012 (figure 2) and during winter/spring (table 1), but neither trend was significant. We also observed a strong but nonsignificant association between resistance and hospitalization but no association for urban versus rural residence (7) or county after stratifying by prescription rates (8) in the univariate analyses.We conducted a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, with hospitalization as the dependent variable; we included variables with significant (p<0.05) and strong (p<0.20) associations from the univariate analysis as independent variables. Forward selection indicated that hospitalized patients were more likely to have resistant infections (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 1.00-5.82) and less likely to have non-O157 infections (OR 0.4, CI 0.21-0.61) (table 2), suggesting that resistant infections or O157 infections may cause more severe clinical outcomes. Patients over 18 years of age, women, and patients with bloody diarrhea were also more likely to be hospitalized.Although we found no significant difference by stx profile, strains possessing stx1 only were more commonly resistant than strains with stx2 alone (p=0.27 by Fisher exact test). All 23 (100 per cent) resistant non-O157 EHEC and 1 (12.5 per cent) resistant O157 strain had stx1 only. Strains positive for eae were less likely to be resistant (n=27; 8.4 per cent) than eae-negative strains (n=4; 23.5 per cent); this nonsignificant difference (p=0.07 by Fisher exact test) could be due to small sample sizes. All 8 resistant O157 strains and 18 (78.3 per cent) of 23 resistant non-O157 strains had eae, demonstrating correlations between virulence genes and serogroups.Overall, we detected a high frequency of resistance among non-O157 EHEC (11.2 per cent), similar to findings from Mexico (15 per cent), although we evaluated fewer drugs (5). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was low despite its routine use for treating enteric infections, perhaps because resistance development in _E. coli_ requires multiple mutations (9). Resistance frequencies in EHEC were low relative to other _E. coli_ pathotypes such as extraintestinal _E. coli_, which may be attributable to differences in the source of the infections (3).The higher O157 resistance frequencies in Michigan than nationwide indicate that selection pressures vary by location and source. Although we observed no difference in resistance frequencies for counties with high versus low antimicrobial drug prescription rates (8), we have not investigated selection pressures from drug use in farm environments that may affect resistance emergence in Michigan. Approximately 12 million kg of antimicrobial drugs are administered to food animals annually in the USA; roughly 61 per cent of these are medically relevant. Higher resistance frequencies in winter/spring (12.2 per cent) than summer/fall (7.5 per cent) could be attributed to variation in prescription rates by season (10).Because Michigan is not part of the CDC Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network and resistance in EHEC has not been widely researched, data about the prevalence and impact of resistance are lacking. This study detected a high frequency of EHEC resistance to antimicrobial drugs commonly used in human and veterinary medicine, particularly for non-O157 serotypes, which have increased in frequency (2). Monitoring resistance in EHEC is essential because of the risk of transmitting resistant strains from food animals to humans and the high likelihood of horizontal transfer of resistance genes from EHEC to other pathogens. Routine monitoring can uncover new treatment approaches and guide development of strategies for controlling emergence and spread of resistance in EHEC and other _E. coli_ pathotypes.References----------1.

In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, antimicrobial therapy was used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain is a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and not thought to be a zoonosis.Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC (ProMED-mail. E. coli EHEC - France: O80:H2, hybrid invasive pathogen, 2005-2014 20160909.4474015 and other reports) indeed introduces another layer of concern about these infections. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
