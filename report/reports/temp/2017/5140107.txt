Scroll In [edited]<https://scroll.in/latest/842103/three-more-cases-of-anthrax-reported-in-andhra-pradesh-tally-rises-to-eight>A total of 3 more cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported from Kodupunjuvalasa village in Araku Mandal district of Visakhapatnam on [Wed 28 Jun 2017], The News Minute reported. As many as 8 villagers have now been confirmed to be suffering from the illness, which is spread by contact with the spores of the bacteria, which are often from infectious animal products.Five people from the village had tested positive for anthrax on [Wed 28 Jun 2017]. All the patients are currently undergoing treatment in the dermatology department of King George Hospital.Doctors suspect that the villagers developed skin infections after they consumed the meat of a goat, which was infected with _Bacillus anthracis_, the bacteria that causes the disease.A door-to-door survey on the disease and living conditions of the tribals was conducted by District Medical and Health Officer Uma Sundari and a team from the department of dermatology of KGH. ""We have taken RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] test samples of the patients reportedly affected by anthrax and sent them to the DRDE Laboratory in Gwalior. A team from Gwalior will be visiting the agency area soon,"" Sundari was quoted as saying by The New Indian Express.State Human Resource Development Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao, who had visited the anthrax-affected patients on [Tue 27 Jun 2017], said officials were working actively to curb the spread of the disease. The Animal Husbandry Department was also taking steps to ensure that animals do not get infected, he added. He also said that the soil would also be tested in and around Kodipunjuvalasa.Anthrax, which can be found naturally in soil, can result in pneumonia, blood infection, and death. It mainly affects animals, but can also spread to humans.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Three more cases, yes, but what about possibly more affected goats? This is something that could have been determined while interviewing these new cases. When the vets run their community livestock vaccination it would be worthwhile asking each owner in turn about any unexpected livestock deaths, and then visiting what might remain of those carcasses. If there is a skull, sample the turbinates, otherwise the medulla of any long bone. And as the neighbours watch, it attracts gossip, and thus further information. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/297>.]
