WHO [edited]<https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/who-scales-response-plague-madagascar>WHO is rapidly scaling up its response to an outbreak of plague in Madagascar that has spread to the capital and port towns, infecting more than 100 people in just a few weeks.On Sat 30 Sep 2017, the Malagasy government confirmed that the death of a Seychellois national was due to pneumonic plague. The basketball coach died in hospital in Antananarivo on Wed 27 Sep 2017 while visiting the island nation for a sports event. Health authorities are tracing people with whom he came into contact in recent days and who may have become exposed to the illness. Once identified, they will be given antimicrobials to prevent infection as a precautionary measure. The incident brings the death count to 21 since the outbreak was identified in late August 2017; at least 114 people have been infected.""WHO is concerned that plague could spread further because it is already present in several cities, and this is the start of the epidemic season, which usually runs from September to April,"" said Dr. Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Madagascar. ""Our teams are on the ground in Madagascar providing technical guidance, conducting assessments, supporting disease surveillance, and engaging with communities,"" she added. ""We are doing everything we can to support the government's efforts, including by coordinating health actors.""Further deployments of WHO staff and through response partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are underway, as well as increased supplies of antibiotics, personal protective equipment and other supplies. WHO has released USD 300 000 in emergency funds, as well as critical medical supplies, to quickly scale up operational efforts and is appealing for USD 1.5 million to support the response.Plague is endemic to Madagascar, where around 400 cases of -- mostly bubonic -- plague are reported annually. Contrary to past outbreaks, this one is affecting large urban areas, which increases the risk of transmission. The number of cases identified thus far is higher than expected for this time of year. Bubonic plague is spread by infected rats via flea bite, pneumonic by person-to-person transmission. The current outbreak includes both forms of plague. Nearly half of the cases identified so far are of pneumonic plague.Plague is a disease of poverty. It thrives in places with poor sanitary conditions and inadequate health services. It can kill quickly if left untreated but can also be cured by common antibiotics if delivered early. The last reported outbreak in December 2016 was mainly bubonic plague occurring in remote areas.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Some sources report as many as 24 deaths as of 30 Sep 2017 (<https://sivertimes.com/plague-madagascar-announces-emergency-measures/71001>).Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans. It is worrisome that some cases have spread to the east side of the island, where plague is not often seen, and that such a substantial cluster is occurring early in the plague season.The last WHO statistics on global plague infections were published in 2016 with data 2010-2015; Bertherata E: Plague around the world, 2010-2015.
