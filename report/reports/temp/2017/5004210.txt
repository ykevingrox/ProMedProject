Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-italy-additional-136-cases-reported-european-immunization-week-begins-99185/>In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in Italy, the number of cases has increased by 136 since our last report [see <http://tinyurl.com/jwuvxno>], bringing the total to 1739 cases since the beginning of the year [2017], according to Italian health officials.Some other data pertaining to the Italy measles outbreak include: 88 percent of the cases are unvaccinated; 1/3 of cases suffered at least 1 complication; 39 percent required hospitalization for their illness; the median age of the cases is 27 years; and 159 cases are among healthcare workers.This update comes on the heels of the start of World Immunization Week (WIW), which in Europe is called the European Immunization Week (EIW) [24-30 Apr 2017]. This is a time to raise awareness and decision-makers about the importance of vaccination in all stages of life.According to a Ministry of Health publication from late March [2017] titled, ""Vaccinations, state of the art, false myths and perspectives. The key role of prevention"" (<http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_pubblicazioni_2586_allegato.pdf> Italian, computer translated): Over the last 20 years in Italy, we have witnessed some epidemics with thousands of cases and some deaths. 2002-2003 was particularly interesting as the Campania region saw the hospitalization of more than 600 people, 16 cases of encephalitis, and 4 deaths.The geographical distribution coincided closely with vaccine coverage, with the lowest in Southern Italy. The vaccine coverage has grown in recent years; however, a downturn has been observed in the last 2 years.In Europe, the latest assessment reveals more than 7500 cases of measles, with Romania being the most affected country with 4793 patients reported between January 2016 and 7 Apr 2017, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. In total there have been 25 deaths in Europe, 22 of which have occurred in Romania. Portugal, Switzerland, and Bulgaria are the other 3 countries with fatalities.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Italy can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>. - Mod.LK]******[2] EuropeDate: Thu 27 Apr 2017 17:05 MSKSource: Sputnik News [edited]<https://sptnkne.ws/epHV>While only a few measles cases registered in Switzerland since the beginning of the year [2017] have been imported by migrants, the possibility of ""hidden importation"" of the disease should not be ruled out, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) told Sputnik on [Thu 27 Apr 2017].Over 4000 people have been affected by outbreaks of measles in Europe since the beginning of 2017, with some cases resulting in the death of the patient, Russian consumer protection watchdog Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] said in a statement on [Wed 26 Apr 2017].""Contrary to previous years, only a few cases of measles could be proven as being imported in 2017 (3 importations for 70 cases announced). These 3 imported cases caused 4 secondary cases. The other cases are considered endemic or with an unknown importation status, although it is likely that for most of the cases announced in Switzerland, there is a hidden importation. Out of the 3 proven cases of importation, 2 came from Italy and 1 from Thailand,"" Adrien Kay, spokesman for the FOPH, which is part of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs, said.According to Rospotrebnadzor, measles cases were registered in 14 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and Sweden. The highly contagious virus was able to spread to these nations due to the low immunity of their populations, the watchdog explained.Kay added that as of [26 Apr 2017], Switzerland had announced 70 cases of measles since the beginning of 2017.""The Federal Office of Public Health recommends a combined vaccine against measles, rubella and mumps,"" he added.Measles is a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease which is a leading cause of death among young children. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) registered more than 134 000 measles deaths globally, most of which were in children under the age of 5.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Belgium (Wallonia)Date: Thu 27 Apr 2017Source: Eurosurveillance edition 2017; 22(17) [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22787> Ref: Grammens T, Schirvel C, Leenen S, et al: Ongoing measles outbreak in Wallonia, Belgium, December 2016 to March 2017: characteristics and challenges.

As at [12 Mar 2017], 177 measles cases were notified, of which 50 percent were 15 years and older, 49 percent female. Atypical clinical presentation and severe complications, mainly among adults, in combination with late notification, low or unknown vaccination coverage of contacts, infected healthcare workers and increased workload due to contact tracing, are the main concerns for outbreak management.Following the detection of a cluster of 3 measles cases in December 2016, since mid-January 2017, an increasing number of measles cases have been notified in Wallonia, Belgium. Between 20 Dec 2016 and 16 Apr 2017, 288 measles cases were reported to the Wallonian regional health authorities, compared with 19, 34, 10, and 14 cases in total for 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We describe the main challenges in the outbreak management such as atypical clinical presentations and difficulties encountered during contact tracing and control measures implementation.

A meeting Wednesday night [26 Apr 2017] tried to spread the word to get more kids vaccinated.Even though the case count has doubled this week, health investigators say the outbreak's development isn't presenting them with any surprises. All of the cases involve unvaccinated Somali children from the age of 10 months to 5 years. 50 percent of the current cases have been hospitalized.""They all make sense based on the exposures that we were aware of and what we were watching for,"" said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director at the Minnesota Health Department.Even so, health officials have redoubled their public health efforts.At a meeting Wednesday night [26 Apr 2017], Ehresmann said guidelines call for Somali children and all children in Hennepin County to be on an accelerated schedule for the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, with 28 days between the required 2 dosages.She said the last large outbreak in Minnesota was in 1990, when 460 cases were reported and 3 people died.""We want to make sure that we are increasing that wall of protection in the community,"" Ehresmann said.She was among speakers at the Cedar-Riverside People's Center to brainstorm among health professionals and Somali leaders about how best to increase vaccination rates and inform the community.Asli Ashkir, a registered nurse and Somali educator at the health department, said there is no fact-based link between autism and vaccinations, a concern she has seen and heard expressed by many families.Still, she never orders parents to vaccinate their children, but explains the facts so they can make their own decision.Lynn Bahta, a registered nurse and public health nurse with the department, told the crowd of about 3 dozen people that vaccination rates have fallen dramatically among Somalis compared to the rest of Minnesota. In 2004, the rates were the same. In 2014, only 42 percent of Somali children were vaccinated for MMR, compared with 89 percent for non-Somalis.The health professionals also stressed the importance of keeping children out of child-care centers if they have been potentially exposed and are unvaccinated.Exposure to the 1st symptoms of measles can take up to 3 weeks. Symptoms often start out resembling those of a cold, with fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Within 8 to 14 days, a rash begins at the head and spreads down to the rest of the body. In severe cases, measles can produce lasting lung and brain damage.[Byline: Glenn Howatt, Pat Pheifer]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to Outbreak News Today, 28 Apr 2017, (<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-now-seen-in-ramsey-county-31360/>), 3 additional measles cases have now been confirmed in the Minnesota outbreak, according to state health officials.
