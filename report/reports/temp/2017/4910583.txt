CBS Los Angeles [edited]<http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2017/03/17/small-school-district-hit-with-500-cases-of-norovirus/>A small school district in Oxnard [Ventura County] was hit with hundreds of cases of norovirus over the past few weeks, although the outbreak seems to have diminished as of [Fri 17 Mar 2017].Rio School District Superintendent John Puglisi confirmed there have been 500 cases of norovirus at all 8 of its schools, but one school was hit harder than the others: Rio Plaza Elementary.""It was horrible, I have not been sick like that for years,"" a Rio Plaza [parent] told KCAL9 [Fri 17 Mar 2017]. [The woman] said both she and her husband fell ill one day after their daughter did.Symptoms at Rio Plaza emerged more than a week ago, causing absences to surge, according to the Ventura County Star. While the district could not say how many cases were reported at Rio Plaza at the height of the outbreak, the number of students with the virus appears to be decreasing. Less than 10 students were out [Fri 10 Mar 2017] due to the virus.The district said multiple alerts to parents during the outbreak and Ventura County public health officials have come out and cleaned all the schools, which were not shut down during the outbreak.""Anything is a consideration, but closing schools per se, did not come as one of the variables of choice,"" Puglisi said.There is also a confirmed case of norovirus at Oak Park High School. 6 more students there have reported symptoms. The health department has not yet called it an outbreak, however. Oak Park's principal told KCAL9 the school has spent hours sanitizing the school and fogging the classroom.Norovirus symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fever and can emerge as many as 3 days after contact. The symptoms often last less than 2 days. Children with these symptoms were being asked to stay home for up to 72 hours after the symptoms have passed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from Google Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.

We can't let our guard down,"" Shelton wrote in an email to parents this week. ""We understand the disappointment of cancelling some important field trips and activities, but in order for us to return to 'normal,' we need to take this action.""In late January [2017], about 190 7th-graders from John Adams Middle School went on a 5-day trip to Yosemite, where health officials believe they caught norovirus. Some students started to experience the illness' characteristic stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea while on the trip.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Norovirus (Norwalk virus) strikes about 20 million people a year in the US, most commonly in the winter, and causes a few days of misery, with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.Despite numerous US school closings, the CDC said [in February 2017] there is nothing unusual so far about this year's norovirus season [however these current numbers are very high].William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) said, ""The norovirus usually affects children, and usually children in a congregate setting."" So the virus can spread easily in schools and day-care centers.It's transmitted person to person, by eating contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces. The virus can live on surfaces for a long time, says Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. ""It's so easy to give norovirus to someone else and to catch it because it takes so few [virus particles] to make you sick,"" he says.He estimated that about 10 viral particles are enough to transmit the infection. In comparison, he says, hundreds of thousands of bacteria are needed to cause a salmonella infection.Symptoms often come on within 24 to 48 hours of exposure. ""It's an illness that usually lasts 2 to 4 days,"" Schaffner says. ""You are miserable. It's thoroughly unpleasant."" Patients are often coping with simultaneous diarrhea and vomiting, he says.Treatment includes drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. If dehydration is suspected, get medical attention.Infected people are contagious the moment they begin feeling sick and for a few days after they recover, or even longer, the CDC says. The virus can remain in the stool for 2 weeks or longer.Death from norovirus is not common, but hospitalization is. The CDC says that each year, the virus leads to about 56 000 to 71 000 hospitalizations and about 570 to 800 deaths.Excerpted from <http://wb.md/2mgU4XA>. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
