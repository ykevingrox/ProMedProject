KMSP [edited]<http://www.fox9.com/news/260128831-story>It's a rare disease in Minnesota, with only 3 reported human cases in 2016, but Minnesota Department of Health warns cases of tularemia could be on the rise. ""It's still uncommon, but over the last several years we are starting to see more and more cases,"" said Kirk Smith with the Minnesota Department of Health.Last week [week of 28 May-3 Jun 2017], health officials reported the 1st tularemia case of 2017 in Burnsville after an infected cat passed the bacterium to a person. The disease can be transmitted by infected animals, wood ticks, deer flies and contaminated water or soil. Cats are a common transmitter to humans, typically contracting the disease from a squirrel or rabbit. Squirrels and rabbits usually getting the disease from infected wood ticks, which is where the bacteria often originates""As the years go on here it's become more common in animals and the environment and consequently in humans as well,"" said Smith.Symptoms of tularemia can include ulcers or sores at the sight of the infection, swollen lymph nodes, high fever and body aches. Tularemia is fatal in up to 5 percent of cases, but treatment with antibacterial therapy normally results in a full recovery.[Byline: Jack Highberger]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.The clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354>.]
