Initially classified as a primary case with possible high risk exposures still under investigation. Presumed (by me) to be part of the identified nosocomial outbreak in Wadi Aldwasir). - Mod.MPP]2- A 56-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Wadi Aldwasir [Riyadh region] with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 10 Mar 2017, at which time she was noted to be in stable condition.

[I have been unable to identify this reported recovery as having been reported as a newly confirmed case. There has been the occasional day over the past few months when no reports were registered on the Saudi MOH website, and it is possible that this case was confirmed on one of those days. - Mod.MPP]5- A 52-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Wadi Aldwasir [Riyadh region] with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 10 Mar 2017 at which time she was noted to be in stable condition. Classified as a secondary case in a household contact. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the past 6 days since the last MERS-CoV update on reported human cases in Saudi Arabia, there have been a total of 4 newly confirmed cases reported, 3 from Ash Sharqiyah region (2 from Dammam and one from Abqiq) and one from Al Qasim (Buraidah). One of these cases is classified as an asymptomatic healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker, presumably a contact of the other case from Dammam who while classified as a primary case with high risk exposures still under investigation, one can't help but wonder whether this might be a repeat of the previous nosocomial cluster in Wadi Alwasir in Riyadh region, now occurring in Dammam.As an overview, since the beginning of the year (1 Jan 2017), there have been a total of 60 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by the Saudi MOH, including very limited nosocomial transmission in Buraidah, Jeddah, Wadi Alwasir, and Dammam, with the majority of cases classified as primary cases.Maps showing the locations of cases and recoveries reported in today's [2 Apr 2017] update can be found at the source URL.
