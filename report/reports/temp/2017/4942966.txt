This shows that CHIKV may have been co-circulating with dengue virus (DENV) during its (dengue) outbreak in November (2016) in Nepal.CHIKV was then perhaps vastly underestimated by physicians, because the _Aedes_ mosquito, a vector for DENV and CHIKV, is uncommon during the winter season, and IgM antibodies to CHIKV may remain positive for several months after infection. Only one CHIKV case was then reported in Nepal. CHIKV was 1st reported in 2013 from Kathmandu and Dhading districts of Nepal [1].Reference1. Pun SB, Bastola A, Shah R. J. First report of Chikungunya virus infection in Nepal. Infect Dev Ctries. 2014; 8(6): 790-2.--Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research Unit, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun is thanked for sending in this report.He makes the important point that -- because symptoms of chikungunya and dengue virus infections (and Zika virus infections also), especially early on, are similar clinically -- laboratory confirmation is necessary. It seems very reasonable that chikungunya virus infections are significantly underreported.Dr. Pun submitted a previous report of chikungunya virus infections in Nepal (Chikungunya (14): Americas, Asia, Pacific, research, observations Archive Number: 20161201.4667167) that stated: ""A 30-year-old female tested positive for chikungunya virus (IgM) at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital on 27 Sep 2016. She was discharged uneventfully 3 days after treatment. According to the patient's relative (personnel communication on 30 Sep 2016), she now developed generalized itching. Although she was a resident of Meghauli, Chitwan district, she developed these symptoms while living in Chandranigahapur-1, Rautahat district (no travel history out of Chandranigahapur at this time), suggesting that chikungunya may have been circulating in this area (personal communication with patient's relative on 30 Sep 2016), but not in Meghauli, Chitwan as the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) believes. Thus, a careful travel history must be taken to identify potential new cases in the area of an index case. To the best of my knowledge, this is the 1st reported case of chikungunya virus infection in Rautahat district of Nepal. Chikungunya virus infection was 1st reported in 2013 in Nepal.""Maps of Nepal can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_Federal_States> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32849>. - Mod.TY][See Also:2016----Chikungunya (15): Asia (Pakistan) conf 20161221.4715533Chikungunya (14): Americas, Asia, Pacific, research, observations 20161201.4667167].................................................jh/ty/msp/jh"
