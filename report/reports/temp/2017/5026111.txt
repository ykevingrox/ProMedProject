UN News Centre [edited]<http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56720#.WRM9wYWcFPY>United Nations humanitarian workers are responding to a growing cholera outbreak in Ayod, the Greater Upper Nile region of South Sudan, one of multiple counties throughout the country where the disease has spread since June 2016.The UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) said it deployed a rapid response team to Jonglei late last month [April 2017], to support local health partners and try to contain the outbreak. ""Conditions are extremely difficult for families in Jiech,"" said Carol Kipsang, an IOM health officer and nurse, referring to a town in Ayod County. More than 230 people are affected there.""We met one mother who was caring for her new born and her sister's child, after her sister died from cholera 2 weeks ago in her community. The young mother walked 1 hour to the IOM clinic to receive treatment for the children and seek nutritional support for her malnourished daughter.""The UN agency launched its response after 140 suspected cases of cholera were reported in Ayod during the 1st weeks of April 2016, threatening the population of some 175 000 people. ""Access to Ayod is difficult during the rainy season, and its proximity to the Nile River increases its vulnerability to outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera,"" IOM said, noting also the ongoing crisis in Jonglei and the lack of health workers and medical supplies. The majority of suspected cholera cases in Ayod come from communities living in cattle camps along the river.Since the cholera outbreak was declared in June 2016, more than 7200 cases of cholera have been reported, including 229 deaths, according to the WHO and the South Sudan Ministry of Health. The disease is also reportedly spreading through swamp water, with millions of people displaced and moving through the swamps to avoid fighters. WHO has provided response kits, medication and equipment for oral rehydration points and cholera treatment units.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - India (Odisha State)Date: Wed 10 May 2017, 11.39 AM ISTSource: The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN) [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/cholera-spreads-in-ganjam/articleshow/58606140.cms>After the Jagannath Prasad block, cholera has now been detected in Kabisurya Nagar town of Ganjam district. ""Out of 11 stool samples tested at the microbiology department of MKCG Medical College, 2 have tested positive of cholera,"" said additional district medical officer (public health), R Jagadees Patnaik on [Tue 9 May 2017].While 1 positive case was detected from Kabisurya Nagar NAC town, the other was from Baliasara, a nearby village. Medical officials thought to send test samples in view of the rampant spread of diarrhea in nearby areas in the last 13 days. Thought to have broken out due to the consumption of contaminated water, the number of diarrhea patients have grown since [Tue 25 Apr 2017], despite several measures by medical staff. While 5 patients were admitted in the Kabisurya Nagar community health center on [Mon 8 May 2017], 1 was admitted on [Tue 9 May 2017].""There is no cause for panic at the detection of cholera. The situation is under control as we have taken several precautionary measures to arrest of spread of the disease,"" said Patnaik. ""We have also alerted the medical officers in the community health center in Kabisurya Nagara and asked the health workers to spread awareness among the people to maintain personnel hygiene and to consume the boiled water"" said the ADMO.Cholera was detected from Jagannath Prasad area, when the diarrheal disease had affected over 150 people in 36 nearby villages. Water-borne disease had outbreak in the area after they consumed the pana (sweet water) on occasion of meru, to mark the end of 21-day Danda Nata, a seasonal dance. The disease was also outbreak in Polasara and Sanakhemundi blocks, recently. ADMO (PH) said the disease was controlled in all affected areas.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - Nepal (Kathmandu)Date: Tue 9 May 2017, 1:37 PMSource: Kathmandu Post [edited]<http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-05-09/cholera-epidemic-claims-a-girl.html>A cholera outbreak over the past few days in Musahar settlement in Kachanari of Bariyarpatti Village Council of Siraha has claimed a girl. At least 10 people have been taken ill from the contagious disease. The 10-year-old daughter died last night, [8 May 2017], from the disease.The District Public Health Office (DPHO), Siraha Chief Dr Chumanlal Das said medical teams were dispatched to the location immediately after receiving information of the spread of the disease. The cause of the cholera outbreak in the Musahar settlement is yet to be ascertained.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Part of the future prevention of cholera in the developing world is cholera vaccine. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera, in Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).References----------57. Luquero FJ, Grout L, Ciglenecki I, et al.
