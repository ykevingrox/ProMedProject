See link <https://www.gideononline.com/2017/10/11/tick-borne-encephalitis-switzerland/>--Steve BergerTel Aviv Medical Center<steve@gideononline.com>[ProMeD-mail thanks Steve Berger for the comment that TBE rates in Switzerland are higher than in surrounding countries. Many of the European TBE reports that ProMED-mail receives are from Germany. The Gideon tool that converts incidence into population rates will be useful for many epidemiologists.Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105>.][See Also:Tick-borne encephalitis - Switzerland 20171010.5371714Tick-borne encephalitis - France 20170630.5141304Tick-borne encephalitis - Netherlands (02): (OV) 20170419.4981607Tick-borne encephalitis virus - Netherlands: (OV) 20170319.49106902016----Tick-borne encephalitis - Germany (02): Dermacentor reticulatus, human 20161014.4558823Tick-borne encephalitis - Germany 20160415.4162919].................................................dk/ty/ec/dk"
