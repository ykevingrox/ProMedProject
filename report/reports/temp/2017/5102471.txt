Orlando Sentinel [edited]<http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-la-fitness-legionairres-investigations-20170612-story.html>Two LA Fitness health clubs in Orange County [Florida] are under investigation after 4 customers contracted legionnaires' disease. 2 of the cases are tied to the club in MetroWest at 4792 Kirkman Road, said Kent Donahue, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health in Orange County, and the other 2 cases are tied to the LA Fitness club at 12700 S. Orange Blossom Trail.The Florida Department of Health sent investigators to the club to take water samples last week [week of 5 Jun 2017], but results won't be available for about 2 weeks, Donahue said. It isn't certain that the 4 individuals contracted the illness at LA Fitness, but all 4 patients used the health clubs. The health department is not aware of other commonalities in the cases.A spokeswoman for LA Fitness did not immediately return a request for comment. LA Fitness sent notices to customers at the 2 facilities last week, warning them to watch out for any signs of legionnaires' disease.Legionnaires' disease is a serious respiratory illness caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. It is usually contracted through water systems or sometimes through air-conditioning systems.An LA Fitness health club in Ocoee was also investigated for signs of _Legionella_ bacteria in April [2017], but results of the [are?] negative, Donahue said (see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (03): (FL) spa & showers susp, RFI 20170422.4987402).Reports of legionnaires' disease and _Legionella_ bacteria are not common in Orange County, but happen more frequently in enclosed water systems, such as hot tubs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC reports that there were about 6000 cases of legionnaires' diseases reported in 2015 in the United States.But LA Fitness in Central Florida has had 2 confirmed cases of the bacteria in recent years, including in 2008 at an LA Fitness in south downtown Orlando and in 2010 at an LA Fitness in the Waterford Lakes area. There was also a positive test for _Legionella_ bacteria at Florida Hospital Orlando in late 2015 and early 2016.The illness is more common in summer and early fall but can happen any time of year, according to the agency's website.Donahue said people at higher risk of contracting serious symptoms from the bacteria include people over 50, people with lung and respiratory diseases and people with compromised immune systems.Because of possible _Legionella_ bacteria, the 2 LA Fitness health clubs are being asked to use elevated levels of chlorine in spa areas and use extra filters on showers.--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4729>.

In a statement on [Sun 11 Jun 2017], the agency said this case of illness was ""potentially associated"" with the officer's workplace.Officers can still work in the building, but the Health Department has advised them to avoid taking showers there, and to use cold water for drinking and for preparing hot beverages and food until the investigation is complete. Hot water has been shut down at the precinct as a precaution, the police said.""There is no public health risk to the larger community,"" the Health Department said in its statement.Officials did not say when the officer had become sick and received the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease, but the investigation began after the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association hired an independent contractor to test the precinct's water. Preliminary results turned up traces of the _Legionella_ bacteria, officials said, and the Health Department was studying those results and conducting its own tests.According to the Health Department, most cases of the disease can be traced to complex plumbing systems in which conditions are favorable for _Legionella_ growth, such as hot water tanks and cooling towers like those used in hotels and hospitals. The disease is contracted by breathing in water vapor containing the bacteria, but it is not contagious and can be treated with antibiotics.Older adults, smokers and people with weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to the disease, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms occur 2 to 10 days after a person is infected, and include chills, fever, headache, and muscle pain.At the 23rd Precinct station house, investigators have ruled out a cooling tower that was installed during renovations last month as the source of the bacteria. The cooling tower, which supports the building's heating and air conditioning system, has not been activated, and the previous tower was shut down in October [2016], the police said.An outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the South Bronx killed 12 people and sickened 128 others in July and August of 2015, the largest outbreak on record in the city, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In response, the mayor and City Council passed a law to reduce and contain _Legionella_ growth in cooling towers. The law requires building owners to register cooling towers with the Health Department, and to clean and test them quarterly for _Legionella_. The rule applies to more than 3500 buildings in the city.[Byline: Ashley Southall]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[The state of New York can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37978>.

In a statement posted on their website [9 Jun 2017], the Southern Nevada Health District says, ""The hotel is assisting in the investigation and taking steps to provide information to past and current guests of the property.""Once the guests' illnesses were confirmed, the Rio then inspected its water system. Results came back positive for the bacteria, _Legionella_, according to the health district. The hotel has begun efforts to disinfect the rooms in the hotel through a process called ""remediation,"" in which chlorine is used at very high temperatures in each room.Caesars Entertainment, which owns the Rio Hotel issued a statement to Fox News saying, ""Test results on the water at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino indicated the presence of the _Legionella_ bacteria. The company is working closely with the Southern Nevada Health District and taking aggressive remediation actions to ensure the safety of Rio's water. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we are relocating guests from rooms where remediation actions are being undertaken.""A human can contract legionnaire's disease by inhaling aerosol water droplets from a number of different spaces with water like the shower, hot tubs, cooling towers, or decorative fountains. The health district notes that most people will not get sick when exposed to the bacteria, but it has the potential to cause severe illness and even death.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are about 5000 cases of legionnaire's reported each year in the US. Outbreaks recently in Flint, Michigan and the South Bronx in New York have led to several deaths.[Byline: Andrew Craft]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his submissions.The state of Nevada can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1065>.
