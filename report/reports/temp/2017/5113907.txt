Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/baguio-city-reports-leptospirosis-death-as-cases-increase-in-cordillera-41125/> One person has died from the bacterial infection leptospirosis.The Cordillera Administrative Region in northern Luzon, Philippines has seen a 40 percent rise in the disease during the 1st 6 months of 2017 compared to the same period last year [2016], according to the Department of Health, Cordillera Administrative Region (DOH-CAR).DOH records show that Baguio City and Kalinga province had the largest number of cases at 21.4%, followed by Benguet and Ifugao provinces (14.3%), and Apayao (7.1%). Flash floods in some regions have been linked to the increase.Geeny Austria, Nurse V of DOH-CAR, advised: ""Please keep out of flooded areas, and wear proper protective gear when going out during rainy season to avoid being infected with the disease.""Leptospirosis, caused by a corkscrew-shaped bacterium called _Leptospira interrogans_, is often referred to as ""rat fever"" due to the principal role rats play in spreading the disease (scientists refer to this type of animal as a reservoir host). Other animals can also be important reservoirs of the disease.These animals can spread the disease in their urine, contaminating water, soil, or food. People who live in close contact with domestic animals or wildlife are at higher risk for getting the disease.People become infected by coming into contact with contaminated urine, water, food, or soil through breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose. Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to contaminated water, such as floodwaters. Person-to-person transmission is rare.Infected individuals initially experience fever, severe headache and muscle aches, abdominal pain, and occasionally a skin rash. Patients in the later stages of disease can suffer from jaundice, kidney failure, bleeding from the mouth or nose, and bloody urine, and the disease can be fatal, especially without proper treatment.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) is a landlocked region on the island of Luzon with 6 provinces: Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain Province. The regional center is Baguio City, located in Benguet province and 247 km (153 miles) north of Manila, the capital of the Philippines (<https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Manila,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines/Baguio,+Benguet,+Philippines>).
