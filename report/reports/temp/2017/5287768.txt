Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Poliovirus weekly update 30-Aug-2017, World Health Organization---------------------------------------------------------------New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 9Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37New cVDPV cases reported this week: 7Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 47Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5Headlines---------- Pakistan and Afghanistan polio eradication teams convened last week in Islamabad to follow up on the southern corridor (Quetta Block - Greater Kandahar) joint planning for the upcoming low transmission season. The meeting was attended by the national teams as well as the staff from the southern region of Afghanistan and Balochistan province of Pakistan.- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples; Syria: 6 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases; and, DR Congo: 1 new cVDPV2 case. Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan, the 1st in Karachi since January 2016. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.Afghanistan------------ No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [10 Jul 2017], from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan.- Preparations continue for a targeted vaccination round in the southern region of the country, scheduled on [11 Sep 2017]Pakistan--------- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [11 Jun 2017], from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.- Two new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples were reported in the past week, from Karachi, Sindh (collected on [7 and 12 Aug 2017]).- Additionally, pre-notification was received this week of a new WPV1 case from Karachi, Pakistan. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting. Karachi had previously been a key reservoir for WPV1 in Pakistan. Analysis is ongoing to determine the origin of this latest case and a response is being planned. The case had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2017]. The last previous case from Karachi is from January 2016.- The National Task Force for Polio Eradication convened last week, chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and attended by the senior leadership from the national and provincial levels. The Task force reviewed the revised National Emergency Action Plan 2017/18 and discussed mechanisms of accelerating the implementation of strategies to stop WPV1 transmission in the key hot spots.- Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.Nigeria-------- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.  The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and cVDPV2 strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin---------------- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and cVDPV2 (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.Central Africa------------- One new case of cVDPV2 was reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), from Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on [20 Jun 2017]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year [2017] is now 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on [20 Jun 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May [2017]).- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on [27-29 Jun 2017] in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from [13-15 Jul 2017] in Haut Lomami and [20-22 Jul 2017] in Maniema.- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.Middle East------------ In Syria, 6 new cases of cVDPV2 were officially reported in the past week from Deir-Ez-Zour governorate, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between [3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017]. The bulk of all cases are from Deir-Ez-Zour, the epicentre of this outbreak.- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates.- The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between [22-26 Jul 2017]. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall).- The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate started on [22 Aug 2017] and is ongoing. Monovalent OPV2 is being provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification - 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers.- Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 29 Aug 2017-----------------------------------------------------------Total global cases in 2017: 9 (compared with 22 for the same period in 2016)- Total in endemic countries in 2017: 9 (compared with 22 for the same period in 2016)- Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016)- Afghanistan: 6 cases in 2017 (compared with 7 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017- Pakistan: 3 cases in 2017 (compared with 13 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jun 1017- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 2 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21 Aug 2016Total global cases in 2016: 37- Total in endemic countries: 37- Total in non-endemic countries: 0Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 29 Aug 2017-------------------------------------------------Total global cases in 2017: 47 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016)- Syrian Arab Republic: 39 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 10 Jul 2017- Democratic Republic of the Congo: 8 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 20 Jun 2017- Pakistan: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016- Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016Total global cases in 2016: 5- Total in endemic countries: 2- Total in non-endemic countries: 3--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Syria - WHO Situation ReportDate: Wed 30 Aug 2017Source: WHO UNICEF Situation Report 11 [edited]<http://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/syria/WHO_UNICEF_Situation_Report_11_cVDPV2_outbreak_Syria_29.8.17_3.pdf?ua=1>Key Highlights--------------- Six (6) new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week: 4 cases are from Mayadeen district and 2 are from Boukamal district, Deir Ez-Zor governorate.- The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 39. All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before [14 Jul 2017].- Final lab results are pending for an additional 5 poliovirus type-2 (PV2) isolates (3 from Mayadeen and 1 from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and 1 from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate).- The 2nd immunization round for Deir Ez-Zor started on [22 Aug 2017] and is ongoing due to high levels of population movement in and out of the governorate during the round.- WHO has organized the redistribution of vaccines and mapping of population movements to increase reach. An additional 90 000 mOPV2 doses are being transported from Damascus to Deir Ez-Zor, to cater for population influxes from As-Sukhnah, Homs governorate, and Al-Qa'im in Iraq. Corrective measures are expected to extend the round by 2 days.- Preparations for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa are underway.- The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 122 (91 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 21 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 1 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 28 AFP cases (12 from Homs city, 13 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).[more details on the vaccination activities and future plans are available at the source URL as well as the epidemic curve and graphic representation of the vaccination status of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis cases by governorate and district. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the above global summary, there is still identified transmission ongoing in Pakistan as seen by the positive environmental sample in Karachi as well as the early report on a case of WPV1 associated disease in Karachi. It will be interesting to learn of the genetic profile of the environmental isolates in Karachi (from this past week as well as from a few weeks ago) and compare them with the newly identified WPV1 associated case in Karachi to see if they are genetically related.There has been more activity associated with cVDPV2 in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), with 6 newly confirmed cases in Syria and 1 newly confirmed case in the DR Congo. According to the Situation Report in section [2] above, there are still 5 additional PV2 (poliovirus type 2) isolates in Syria undergoing final testing -- 4 from Deir al Zour and 1 from Raqqa. Hence there will probably be more cases confirmed in the coming days or weeks. I have not been able to identify similar report information from the DR Congo outbreak so it is not clear if the transmission has been interrupted leaving a total of 8 cases, or if there are still probable cases pending confirmation.A map showing the global distribution of all WPV1 associated cases and cVDPV associated cases can be found at: <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at:Syria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>Pakistan: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>- Mod.MPP]
