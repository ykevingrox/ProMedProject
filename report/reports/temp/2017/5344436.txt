UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, WHO report [edited]<https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-cholera-response-weekly-epidemiological-bulletin-w37-2017-sep-18-sep-24-enar>Yemen: Cholera response weekly epidemiological bulletin: W37 2017 (18-24 Sep 2017-----------------------------------------------------------------------Highlights----------- The cumulative total from 27 Apr 2017 to 24 Sep 2017 is 738 212 suspected cholera cases and 2117 associated deaths (CFR 0.29 percent).- 28 277 suspected cases and 16 associated deaths were reported in W38 [25 Sep-1 Oct 2017].- The national attack rate is 259.41 per 10 000.- The 5 governorates with the highest cumulative attack rates per 10 000 remain Amran (639), Al Mahwit (583), Al Dhale'e (558), Abyan (456), and Hajjah (347).- Children under 5 years old represent 25.7 percent of total suspected cases. Children under 18 years old represent 55.9 percent.- In total, 12 864 rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) have been performed which represents 17.4 percent coverage. 1624 cultures have been performed which represents 19.3 percent coverage. The last positive laboratory confirmation was on the 20 Sep 2017 in Hubaysh district.Governorate and district level------------------------------- The trend at country level over the past 3 weeks is considered stable.- At governorate level, the trend from W35-W37 [4-24 Sep 2017] increased in 4 governorates: Al Hudaydah (+20 percent), Saada (+53 percent), Mokhla (+25 percent), Sayon (+50 percent).- At district level, the range number of deaths in week 38 is [0-3]- Those districts are under particular surveillance: As Safra (Saada); Al marawit, Az Zuhra, Ad Dahi (Al hudaydah).Conclusions and actions------------------------ In response to the continued increases in numbers of suspected cholera cases, WHO and health authorities are still strongly recommend the following:- Strictly apply case definition. All cases that are line listed MUST meet the case definition of suspected cholera. There must be the presence of acute watery diarrhea, defined as 3 or more loose stools in the past 24 hours.- Strengthen laboratory testing. At a minimum, 1 in 10 patients should be tested with rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Where feasible, exhaustive testing of all admissions to DTC [diarrhea treatment centre] is recommended. All RDT positive cases should be tested for culture.- Strengthen data collection and reporting. Partners should use one register to record consultations at DTC and ORC [oral rehydration corner], and use the line list register ONLY for those that meet case definition of suspected cholera.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Based on this report, I have updated the numbers as of 24 Sep 2017.

This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only 20 weeks old and is 4.3 times the total number of global cases of 2015 and 2.17 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.3 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. At the current rate of cases, by the end of September 2017, there may be 3 quarters of a million cases. By the end of 2017 at this rate of 5000 cases/day, there may be 1.3 million cases. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
