Medical Xpress [edited]<https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-06-yemen-cholera-outbreak.html>A cholera outbreak in Yemen, which has claimed 1400 lives in 2 months, shows tentative signs of slowing as fatality rates drop by half, the WHO said on Tue 27 Jun 2017Nearly 219 000 suspected cases have been registered since 27 Apr 2017 and more than 1400 people have died, the UN agency said. The collapse of Yemen's infrastructure after more than 2 years of war between the Saudi-backed government and Shiite rebels who control the capital has made for a ""perfect storm for cholera,"" the WHO's senior emergency adviser for Yemen, Ahmed Zouiten, said.But fatality rates have dropped from 1.7 percent in early May 2017 to 0.6 percent now, he added. He attributed the fall to emergency intervention by health workers. Reported cases of cholera have also dropped in recent days with 39 000 over the past week compared with an average of 41 000 in previous weeks. But Zouiten cautioned that the decline in numbers might be due to underreporting over the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday [25-26 Jun 2017]. He said the total number of cases could still double before the outbreak ends. The UN has warned 300 000 people could contract the highly contagious infection by September 2017.Hospitals have struggled to cope with the outbreak. The war has left less than half of the impoverished country's medical facilities functional. It has also pushed Yemen to the brink of famine, with some 17 million people --2/3 of the population -- uncertain of where their next meal will come from, according to the World Food Programme.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the dreadfully impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 53202 Jun / 73 700 / 60504 Jun / 86 400 / 67605 Jun / 91 400 / 72806 Jun / 96 000 / 74607 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 1400To be consistent with past posts, the date is the day prior to the specific posting but, as this one, may not reflect the data point day.
