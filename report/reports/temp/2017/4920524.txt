EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]This outbreak has been investigated for just over 3 months (1st cases identified in December 2016) with a national outbreak team but they have had no luck identifying a source (not uncommon). The PHAC notification provides general advice. The 12 cases in BC have been spread out geographically and by age, with the latest case detected in February 2017. Consumer loyalty cards as well as a standard national questionnaire are being used to try to determine any common food items consumed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 22 Mar 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]There are 24 cases of _E. coli_ O121 reported in 4 provinces in Canada. Among them 12 cases in British Columbia, 4 cases in Saskatchewan, 3 cases in Alberta, and 5 cases in Newfoundland and Labrador starting from November 2016 to February 2017. A total of 6 cases have been hospitalized and have either recovered or are recovering. The investigation of the outbreak is ongoing. Most common ways to contact with E. coli are improperly handling of ground meat and eating under-cooked ground meat. Lack of hand hygiene also plays an important role in an epidemic. In addition, _E. coli_ also spreads through contaminated fruits and vegetables, contaminated water, unpasteurized milk and apple juice. Although anyone can get infected by _E. coli_, pregnant women, immunocompromised, children and older population are the most vulnerable group.--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberMohammad EhsanRyerson University[ProMED thanks these EpiCore volunteers for this information. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12>.]
