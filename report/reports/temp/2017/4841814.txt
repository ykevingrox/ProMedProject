New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene [edited]<http://on.nyc.gov/2kL4BVX>2017 alert #3: Leptospirosis Cluster in the Concourse area of the Bronx- A total of 3 cases of human leptospirosis have been identified over the past 2 months in a one block section of the Concourse area of the Bronx.- Human leptospirosis cases are very rare in New York City and are associated with exposure to rats. Person-to-person transmission is rare.- Report all suspected cases of human leptospirosis to the Health DepartmentA total of 3 cases of human leptospirosis have been reported over the past 2 months among persons whose exposure occurred within a 1 block section of the Concourse area of the Bronx.Human leptospirosis cases are very rare in New York City; this is the 1st time a cluster of cases has been identified. All 3 cases had severe illness and were hospitalized with acute renal and hepatic failure. 2 cases developed pulmonary hemorrhage and 1 died as a result of infection. The remaining 2 were discharged home. The Health Department is working with building owners in the affected area to remediate rodent infestations.Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete bacteria of the genus and species _Leptospira interrogans_. Warm, moist environments are associated with higher rates of disease, with cases occurring in both rural and urban settings. Clinically, there is a wide spectrum of illness ranging from a mild febrile illness characterized by sudden onset of fever, and any of the following: headache, photophobia, conjunctival suffusion, nausea, vomiting, and muscle pain especially in the calf and lumbar areas. Others may present with aseptic meningitis and in more severe cases, there is renal and hepatic failure and sometimes pulmonary hemorrhage or hemodynamic collapse along with thrombocytopenia.In New York City, most human cases are associated with exposure to rats, or rodent infested environments. Infected animals may excrete the bacteria into the environment. Humans can become infected through contact with urine from infected animals, or from water, soil, or food that has been contaminated with the urine of infected animals. The bacteria can enter the body through open wounds or mucous membranes. Person-to-person transmission is rare.Between 2006 and 2016, there were 26 cases of leptospirosis reported among New York City residents (range of 1 to 3 cases per year). The median age was 42 years (range 7 to 80 years). All but 1 of the cases was male (95 percent). Cases were reported from all 5 boroughs: Brooklyn (6), Bronx (8), Manhattan (7), Queens (4) and Staten Island (1).Given the non-specific presentation of leptospirosis, providers are reminded to consider leptospirosis in any patient presenting with evidence of acute renal and hepatic failure, or any patient with clinically compatible illness (as defined above) and a history of exposure to rats or environments contaminated by rat excreta.Diagnostic testing is available through most commercial laboratories. Providers should order (1) serologic testing (acute and convalescent specimens collected 2 weeks apart), as well as (2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on blood and urine samples collected during the 1st week following the onset of illness and prior to the start of antibiotics.If you suspect that a person has leptospirosis, begin appropriate antimicrobial treatment as soon as possible (without awaiting diagnostic test results), as early treatment may help decrease the severity and duration of disease. For patients with mild symptoms, doxycycline is a drug of choice (100 mg orally, twice daily). Doxycycline is not recommended for pregnant women or children aged less than 8 years, and alternative options include ampicillin and amoxicillin. Intravenous penicillin (1.5 MU every 6 hours) is a drug of choice for patients with severe leptospirosis, with ceftriaxone shown to be as effective in 1 study.Suspect cases of leptospirosis, especially in the Concourse area of the Bronx, should be reported to the Health Department by calling the Provider Access Line at (1-866-692-3641). As always, we appreciate your continued collaboration with our efforts to respond to emerging infectious disease threats in New York City.Sincerely,Demetre Daskalakis, MD MPHActing Deputy Commissioner Division of Disease Control--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 15 Feb 2017, 1:33 AMSource: New York Daily News [edited]<http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/infection-caused-rat-urine-kills-sickens-bronx-article-1.2972909>A rare infection spread by rat urine killed 1 person and sickened 2 more in the Bronx over the past 2 months, city officials said [Tue 14 Feb 2017].The 3 people, who all live on a single block in the Bronx's Concourse neighborhood, were diagnosed with leptospirosis, a bacterial infection spread by rat urine. Two people were diagnosed in December [2016], and 1 this month [February 2017]. Of the 3 patients, 2 have recovered from the infection, officials said.""This illness can be serious but is treatable with readily available antibiotics,"" city Health Department officials said in a statement released [Tue 14 Feb 2017]. It enters through the body either through cuts or through the eyes, nose or mouth. ""Symptoms can range from a mild illness with fever, headaches, chills, muscle aches, vomiting or diarrhea, to a life-threatening sickness that affects the kidneys and liver,"" health officials said.At 750 Grand Concourse, a Health Department notice warned tenants that a resident of the building was 1 of the 3 people diagnosed, CBS 2 reported.The city routinely finds signs of rat infestation at that building, records show, and an inspection [Mon 13 Feb 2017] showed ""active rat signs."" In November 2015, the public advocate's office deemed the owner the ""City's Worst Landlord.""[Byline: John Annese]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Leptospira are transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, usually rats, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with 1 of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal.Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians, dairy farmers, and rice and sugarcane field workers. It is a recreational hazard for those who participate in outdoor water sports such as swimming, rowing, or whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and rivers. Living in rat-infested apartment buildings apparently is the factor that placed the 3 Bronx residents at risk for contracting leptospirosis. Although vaccines are available for immunizing other animals against leptospirosis, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans.Leptospirosis initially presents as a non-specific illness with chills, fever, headache, myalgias, and conjunctival suffusion. Patients often have a dry cough, which is usually mild and without any sequelae, that accompanies the other symptoms. Severe leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterized by liver damage (causing jaundice), renal failure, and bleeding. Meningoencephalitis and myocarditis may also be present. However, pulmonary involvement, which manifests itself as pulmonary hemorrhage, can be severe, with massive hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency and death <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519021/>. Leptospirosis-associated severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome has been increasingly reported worldwide and is associated with case fatality rates greater than 50 percent <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16148523&dopt=Abstract> and <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/14/3/07-1064_article>.Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The leptospira Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/>. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.The Bronx is the northernmost of the 5 boroughs of New York City, in the US state of New York. The Bronx is the 3rd most densely populated county in the US <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx>. The Grand Concourse, modeled on the Champs-ÌälysÌ©es in Paris, is a major north-south thoroughfare stretching 4 mi [approx. 6 km] in the western part of the borough <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Concourse_(Bronx)>. A map showing the Grand Concourse can be found at <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Concourse,+Bronx>. 750 Grand Concourse, the apartment building where 1 of the cases lived, is located in the South Bronx section of the borough <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx>. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/252>.]
