They are being treated in different hospitals located elsewhere in Kathmandu. It is well known that leptospirosis generally occurs during the rainy season, and was found to be the 4th most common disease reported among febrile patients in Kathmandu, Nepal [1]. Leptospirosis is, unfortunately, heavily underestimated/underreported and is often not considered in the differential diagnosis in Nepal. As a result, many patients may have had developed renal complications or Weil's disease, although it is yet to be known/studied in Nepal. Reference---------1.
