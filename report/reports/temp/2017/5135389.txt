Prior to this, the Office would obtain kits from the Department of Health Services and provide [them] to the Bharatpur Hospital.The facility for testing scrub typhus bacteria (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_, [formerly] known as _Rickettsia tsutsugamushi_) is currently available only in the Chitwan Medical College. The college charges Rs 2500 [USD 24.28] per test. The service is free in government hospitals.DPHO, Chitwan officiating Chief Narhari Sharma said efforts were on to get kits from the center, but to no avail. He said he had no idea why the center was not sending kits to the district. A total of 4 people have died from this bacterial disease that is transmitted by mites in the current fiscal year.According DPHO Kit controller Ram KC, to date since the beginning of the current fiscal, 1627 suspected patients underwent the test for scrub typhus and 504 were positive.It seems that the chances of transmission of scrub typhus bacteria are relatively higher in the months of Kattik and Asoj (mid-September to mid-November) as 166 and 112 scrub typhus cases were recorded in these months last year [2016].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Tue 20 Jun 2017, 4:15 PMSource: Republica [edited]<http://www.myrepublica.com/news/22251/>A total of 4 new cases of scrub typhus have been detected in Chitwan in the past 2 months.The District Public Health Office (DPHO), Chitwan confirmed the detection of 4 new cases of scrub typhus in the period of 2 months (mid-April to mid-June); 4 women - 3 from the district and 1 from Nawalparasi -, tested positive for _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ ([formerly] _Rickettsia tsutsugamushi_), the bacteria that causes the disease.According to DPHO Chitwan's Ram Kumar KC, they are being treated at the Chitwan Medical College.The district had 1st reported scrub typhus last year [2016], further finding 533 infected altogether.

Chiggers are most active during warmer summer months (<https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2000/06/got-chiggers-it-figures>). Chiggers live in shaded grassy areas and tend to be more abundant during rainy spells because they need a high-level of humidity in order to survive. During the heat of the afternoon or during long dry spells, they may retreat toward the moist soil. Once chiggers have fed on humans, they drop off of their host and transform into nymphs, which then develop into adult mites that feed on plant material and are harmless to humans.Chitwan is a district in Central Region of Nepal and Nawalparasi is an adjacent district in the Western region.
