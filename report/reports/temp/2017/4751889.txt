The main cause of the disease in Cibitoke province is the shortage of water in the area which pushes people to drink and use dirty water from the Nyakagunda River.[Byline: Aurore Ishimwe]--Communicated by:ProMED-mailpromed@promedmail.org******[3] Cholera - South SudanDate: Thu 29 Dec 2016Source: WHO [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/situation-report-101-cholera-south-sudan-2359-hours-29-december-2016>Situation Update----------------Cholera outbreaks were confirmed in 9 (3percent) of 28 states countrywide. The affected states include Imatong, Eastern Lakes, Jubek, Terekeka, Jonglei, Western Bieh, Northern Liech, Southern Liech; and Eastern Nile. Suspect cholera cases were reported in Mayendit, Panyijiar, and Ayod.Cumulatively 139 (34.6 percent) of the samples tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ serotype Inaba in the National Public Health Laboratory as of [29 Dec 2016]. Jubek state has recorded 2006 cholera cases including 27 deaths (CFR 1.35 percent). No new cholera case was reported in Jubek State during week 51 of 2016.Active transmission is ongoing in Bentiu PoC where:1. Cases have been on the increase since week 41 [2016] with 134 new cases reported in week 50.2. Nearly 80 percent of the cases are children under 14 years of age3. New cases in recent arrivals from Guit, Leer, and Koch.4. More women are affected than males possibly due to their traditional domestic chores.5. The sectors neighboring the waste water pond also have the highest attack rate of cholera.6. The 12 blocks which closely border this pond registered 25 percent of cholera cases.7. The epidemic curve denotes continuous source outbreak that is consistent with exposure to water from the pond.8. Tailored recommendations considering the current trends in Bentiu PoC.In Southern Liech (Leer and Mayendit), the response is led by UNIDO although implementation of sustained and comprehensive investigation and response activities continues to be constrained by security concerns. In Pigi, Eastern Nile state, transmission has been contained with the last 4 cases discharged from Kurwai PHCC on [15 Nov 2016]. Cholera was confirmed in Pigi after 2 cases tested positive by culture on [2 Nov 2016]. A least 163 cases including 6 deaths (5 health facility and 1 community) (CFR 2.98 percent) were reported since [10 Oct 2016]. Health and WASH activities in Pigi are led by NHDF supported by WHO, UNICEF, and MSF-F.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As a reminder, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is ""non-O1""), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the ""classical"" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL******[4] Cholera - Tanzania (Katavi Region)Date: Fri 13 Jan 2017Source: Coast Week [edited]<http://www.coastweek.com/4001-Cholera-outbreak-kills-three-in-western-Tanzania-official.htm>A total of 3 people have died in western Tanzania's district of Tanganyika following a fresh cholera outbreak, an official said on [Sat 7 Jan 2017].Salehe Mhando, Tanganyika District Commissioner, said Karema Division, [eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika], that a total of 91 cholera cases have been recorded.Mhando who is also the district's disaster committee chairperson said in a telephone interview that the 1st case was diagnosed on [9 Dec 2016] in Kapalamsenga ward. ""So far, the cholera outbreak has affected 4 wards in Karema Division, which include Kapalamsenga, Isengule, Ikola, and Karema,"" he said. The official explained for the past three weeks, [19 Dec 2016-7 Jan 2017] 67 out of 91 have been treated.Mhando cited lack of toilets as one of the causes of the disease, taking into account that most of the households have no such facilities as some relieve themselves into the lake and other water bodies.""The challenge is some people prefer to use water from the lake rather than using piped water...that's why we're linking the situation with the cholera outbreak in this area,"" he said. He, however, said that the district authorities have put in place several measures against the waterborne disease including banning people from using water directly from the lake for cooking, bathing, drinking and instead they should use piped water.--Communicated by:ProMED-mailpromed@promedmail.org******[5] Cholera - Tanzania (Dodoma Region)Date: Sun 25 Dec 2016Source: News Ghana [edited]<https://www.newsghana.com.gh/cholera-sparks-fear-in-central-tanzania-during-festive-season/>At least 7 people have died of cholera in central Tanzania's region of Dodoma due to a cholera outbreak, authorities said Sunday [25 Dec 2016]. Authorities in the region have, therefore, banned selling of food stuff by the roadsides and other open places during the festive season, citing a possible escalation of the epidemic.James Kiologwe, Dodoma Regional chief physician warned residents, saying that at least 329 people contracted the disease in the latest outbreak. He warned that if no strict measures were taken the entire region would be affected. ""I urge the public to be more careful during the festive season, avoid eating carelessly on the streets and maintain hygiene since the disease is likely to spread further if we don't comply with health standards,"" the official said.He cited Mpwapwa as leading other districts in the Dodoma Region with 208 cholera cases, followed by Kongwa (95), Chamwino (18) and Dodoma (8). The district also led in deaths with 3 cases as both Kongwa and Dodoma districts witnessed 2 deaths each.Following the new outbreak of the disease, Christine Mndeme, Dodoma District Commissioner said she had initiated a campaign against the disease aimed at eradicating it in the district. She called on ward and village health officers to spread awareness and education on the disease, urging them to quickly report any cases occurred within their areas of jurisdiction.In [October 2016], the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare notified WHO of new cholera outbreaks in 13 regions in the country, during which 68 people died.--Communicated by:ProMED-mailpromed@promedmail.org******[6] Cholera - Somalia (Bay Region)Date: Wed 4 Jan 2017Source: Al-Somal Al-Jadid (The New Somalia) [in Arabic, trans.

The 2, a 5-year-old child and an adult from Kipini border of Lamu and Tana River Counties died on separate dates this week [December 2016] following the outbreak. Thirteen other people have been referred to the Witu Dispensary after exhibiting cholera symptoms. The victims are suspected to have drunk contaminated water.Due to the drought situation that has hit most parts of Lamu and Tana River counties for the past 6 months, residents have had to share the scarce water sources with livestock and wild animals, leading to high rate of contamination of the water through faeces and urine.County Public Health Officer Mr Athman Dumila confirmed the deaths on [Thu 15 Dec 2016] and said a team from the Lamu County health department had already gone to the ground to assist in containing the situation.A team of Kenya Red Cross Society, Lamu Branch also went to the affected area to contain the situation.[Byline: Kalume Kazungu & Galgalo Bocha]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Prevention of cholera is primarily done with safe water/sanitation systems well demonstrated by the lack of cholera spread when introduced by travel into countries with clean water. Vaccination against cholera can also be useful. The use of a cholera vaccine during an ongoing outbreak was 1st demonstrated to be effective during an outbreak in the African country of Guinea in 2012 and reported in 2014:The publication with its citation is: Luquero FJ, Grout L, Ciglenecki, I, et al. Use of _Vibrio cholerae_ vaccine in an outbreak in Guinea. N Engl J Med. 2014;370(22): 2111-20; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1312680.Background----------""The use of vaccines to prevent and control cholera is currently under debate. Shanchol is one of the 2 oral cholera vaccines prequalified by the World Health Organization; however, its effectiveness under field conditions and the protection it confers in the 1st months after administration remain unknown. The main objective of this study was to estimate the short-term effectiveness of 2 doses of Shanchol used as a part of the integrated response to a cholera outbreak in Africa.Methods-------We conducted a matched case-control study in Guinea between [20 May 2012 and 19 Oct 2012]. Suspected cholera cases were confirmed by means of a rapid test, and controls were selected among neighbors of the same age and sex as the case patients. The odds of vaccination were compared between case patients and controls in bivariate and adjusted conditional logistic-regression models. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-odds ratio) X 100.Results-------Between [8 Jun 2012 and 19 Oct 2012], we enrolled 40 case patients and 160 controls in the study for the primary analysis. After adjustment for potentially confounding variables, vaccination with 2 complete doses was associated with significant protection against cholera (effectiveness, 86.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 56.7 to 95.8; P=0.001).Conclusions-----------In this study, Shanchol [cholera vaccine] was effective when used in response to a cholera outbreak in Guinea. This study provides evidence supporting the addition of vaccination as part of the response to an outbreak. It also supports the ongoing efforts to establish a cholera vaccine stockpile for emergency use, which would enhance outbreak prevention and control strategies.""Although these are small numbers, the investigators working in less than ideal conditions should be lauded for this study, which may be the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" regarding using a cholera vaccine during an ongoing outbreak of _V. cholerae_.The biologic used, Shanchol (produced in India), contains killed different biotypes of bacilli of both O1 and O139 serotypes. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study revealed a cumulative efficacy of the product at 5 years of 65 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval] 52-74), with significant protection at the P less than 0.0001 level (1). The other WHO prequalified vaccine, Dukoral, produced in Sweden, contained several biotypes of O1 only together with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit.As a review, the cholera toxin, encoded by the ctxA and ctxB genes, is the principal toxin produced by _V. cholerae_ O1 and O139 and is responsible for the disease. The genes are encoded with a filamentous bacteriophage. The toxin has many immunological properties that include impressive adjuvant properties and action as an anti-inflammatory agent. Each toxin molecule contains a catalytic A subunit (the active toxin) and 5 B subunits that bind the holotoxin to its ganglioside GM1 receptor. After internalization, a subunit of A, A1, will catalyze the ribosylation of a GTP-binding protein which increases the activation of adenyl cyclase and a chloride channel CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) which produces increased chloride secretion, intestinal water accumulation and diarrhea. It is mutations in CFTR that produces cystic fibrosis, a disease that affects a number of organs related to difficulties in fluid secretion (2).References----------1.
