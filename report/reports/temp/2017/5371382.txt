Seychelles Ministry of Health, Facebook post [edited]<https://www.facebook.com/mohseychellesofficial/posts/747073488827118>Man tests positive for plague following presentation of symptoms----------------------------------------------------------------In interview today [Tue 10 Oct 2017], Dr Jude Gedeon, Public Health Commissioner confirmed that a 34 year old man has been infected with the plague. The man who traveled to Madagascar, arrived in Seychelles on [Fri 6 Oct 2017], at which point he was placed under passive surveillance.""He presented with symptoms yesterday, [Mon 9 Oct 2017]. He was not feeling well and reported to a health center. Because he was under surveillance, he was immediately put in isolation at the Seychelles Hospital,"" Dr Gedeon said. Several tests were done, some of which had normal results. ""We also conducted a rapid plague test which produced a weakly positive result,"" Dr Gedeon added. Following this, the result was sent to L'institut Pasteur in France for cross-checking, at which point it was confirmed to be a positive plague result.The man has been immediately given antimicrobial treatment and all people who came into direct contact with him have also been put under active surveillance. These include his partner who also presented with symptoms today [Tue 10 Oct 2017], but has not been confirmed to be infected, and a child who resides with them.Dr Gedeon has reassured that there is no reason to panic and that the Public Health Authority is continuing to enforce measures to prevent an outbreak within the country. ""We continue to monitor passengers who enter the country from Madagascar. There are currently 42 people who are under passive surveillance,"" he stated. Moreover, 15 people who have been identified to have come into contact with the man have also been put on antimicrobial treatment to prevent infection.""Plague can easily be treated with antimicrobials when detected early. And, our objective is to have early diagnosis and identification of points of contact, so we can administer treatment early,"" Dr Gedeon further added with regards to strategies being implemented by the Ministry of Health.At the moment, Air Seychelles has cancelled all flights to and from Madagascar as a further preventative measure. All members of the basketball delegation who were put under active surveillance at a center have also been discharged following no presentation of symptoms.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Tue 10 Oct 2017Source: Seychelles Ministry of Health, Facebook post [edited]<https://www.facebook.com/pg/mohseychellesofficial/posts/?ref=page_internal>New isolation unit setup as additional measure to deal with plague------------------------------------------------------------------Dr Danny Louange, CEO of Health Care Agency, has confirmed that a new isolation unit is being setup at the Seychelles Hospital. He said this during an interview with the media today [Tue 10 Oct 2017]. The new unit will be temporarily located on the 2nd floor of the Seychelles Hospital on Hermitte Ward. The Hermitte Ward is being moved to the antenatal ward. Thus, the 2 maternity wards will be merged until further notice.This measure is being taken by the Ministry of Health in the event that more cases of plague are diagnosed. ""We need to provide a facility for patients who will be put under isolation and the best place to properly do this is Hermitte Ward,"" Dr Louange explained. ""The unit requires 2 separate sections and Hermitte ward already allows for this to be done. In addition it has 2 different doorways."" This will permit staff to have different entrances based on their stations.It is important that people with symptoms of plague are put in the correct environment. They need to be in a facility where they can get the right care and treatment. Dr Louange reassures the public that the Health Care Agency has enough resources to treat patients in case of more plague diagnosis.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The manifestations of plague in this case exported to Seychelles are not reported and ProMED would like more information in this regard. _Yersinia pestis_, the etiological agent of human plague, is transmitted from person-to-person via the respiratory route from a patient with plague pneumonia. Primary pneumonic plague arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are 2ary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days, after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood) and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts. CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters [6.6 feet] as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.Seychelles, officially the Republic of Seychelles, is an archipelago and country in the Indian Ocean. The 115-island country, whose capital is Victoria, lies 1500 km (approx 932 mi) east of mainland East Africa. Other nearby island countries and territories include Comoros, Mayotte (region of France), Madagascar, RÌ©union (region of France) and Mauritius to the south. With a population of roughly 94 228, it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country.
