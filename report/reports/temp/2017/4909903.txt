NAIJ [edited]<https://www.naij.com/1094177-fg-announces-outbreak-a-disease-nigeria.html>The Federal Government says it has deployed epidemiologists and vaccines to arrest the outbreak of a new a strain of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) in parts of the country.The Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole said this on [Thu 16 Mar 2017] in Abuja that the new strain, which is not common in Nigeria, was imported from Niger Republic. Adewole said that the new strain requires a different type of vaccine and a team of epidemiologists has been deployed to address the challenge.He described the outbreak of meningitis in Sokoto and Zamfara States as an unfortunate incidence, stressing that the ministry is working hard to contain the situation. ""It has become an annual ritual under this administration; we would want to put an end to annual outbreak of meningitis in some of the northern states. I have just spoken with the commissioner for health in Zamfara who is appreciative of what the Federal Ministry of Health has been doing through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. We have sent field epidemiologists; they are actually called disease detectives, to support them at the state level,"" Adewole said.The minister said that government has provided vaccines and would continue to do more in terms of whatever was needed with respect to material and technical support to overcome the outbreak. ""What we know in public health is that there is always an outbreak, but what is uncertain is where and the type. We want to be ready at any time,"" he said.Adewole said he has scheduled a meeting with the commissioners of health from the Northern states to plan a resilient and strong strategy to put an end to meningitis outbreak in the country. He said all the states in northwest region are prone to the disease and the states would be treated equally when confronted by outbreaks such as this.An outbreak of CSM has claimed 5 lives in Gada and Wauru towns of Gada Local Government Area of Sokoto State. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Balarabe Kakale, said that the victims died at the Gada General Hospital and Wauru Primary Health Centre. He said: ""3 of the deaths were recorded at the Gada General hospital, while 2 were recorded at the Wauru PHC."" A similar report outbreak was also reported from Zamfara on [Tue 14 Mar 2017].[Byline: Aanu Adegun]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report above says that a ""new strain, which is not common in Nigeria,"" ""imported from Niger"" is responsible for a recurrence of meningitis during the current dry season. Although the organism is not stated, it is likely to be _Neisseria meningitidis_, which causes annual outbreaks of meningitis in the African meningitis belt during the hot, dry season, between December and June. Both Nigeria and Niger fall within the African Meningitis Belt._Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf>). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/>), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and other bacterial species.ProMED-mail previously reported in 2015 on the emergence of outbreaks of meningitis due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C in Kebbi State (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebbi>) in northwest Nigeria and Niger (see alsos below). The emergence of serogroup C outbreaks in the African Meningitis Belt has been thought to be evidence of serogroup replacement in the meningitis belt following mass vaccination with serogroup A conjugate vaccine. However, the current outbreak may be due to serogroup C or some other serogroup such as W. which had been reported in Niger in 2015 (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger: fatal, serogroups C, W 20150430.3332448). More information from knowledgeable sources in this regard would be appreciated.Sokoto and Zamfara States are located in the extreme northwest of Nigeria; a map of Nigerian states can be found at: <http://dailymail.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10360606_10203337420937904_71905998820449261_n.jpg>. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1780>.]
