CDC and APHL have also shared the below communications with clinicians.New Reportable Disease: _Bacillus cereus_ biovar anthracisOverview:-------An unknown strain of _Bacillus cereus_ causing anthrax-like disease was 1st isolated in a dead chimpanzee in Cote d'Ivoire in 2001 and again in 2002. Following in 2004 and 2006, researchers isolated samples from another chimpanzee and a western lowland gorilla further east in Cameroon. Although anthrax is caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, tests showed the isolated strain was a form of _B. cereus_ carrying plasmids that were identical to the virulence plasmids found in _B. anthracis_. The new strain was named _B. cereus_ biovar (bv) anthracis.Currently, _B. cereus_ bv anthracis distribution is limited to some African countries. However, _B. cereus_ bv anthracis has the same potential to pose a severe threat to public health as does _B. anthracis_, currently regulated as a Tier 1 select agent. In October 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) added _B. cereus_ bv anthracis to the HHS select agent list. HHS believes that _B. cereus_ bv anthracis presents the same threat to public health and national security as does _B. anthracis_.Ordering Testing:---------_B. cereus_ is commonly isolated in the laboratory and is typically considered to be non-pathogenic. To reduce the burden of unnecessary rule-out testing of all _B. cereus_ isolates and to ensure that _B. cereus_ bv anthracis infection is identified when present, clinicians are asked to do the following:- Notify the laboratory when you order testing on a patient who presents with anthrax-like symptoms.- Include a patient travel history with the laboratory test requisition form.- Report suspect cases to local public health.- If you have additional questions, contact your State Public Health Laboratory.--Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists2872 Woodcock Blvd, Suite 250Atlanta, GA 30341[I would like to repeat a comment by my fellow moderator ML in relation to a previous report [8 Sep 2016, Bacillus cereus, anthrax-like infection - Africa: wildlife, livestock 20160908.4475451]: ""This paper raises an important question: How often in the past have simplistic sorting of _Bacillus_ colonies from a dead animal led to a pathogenic _B. cereus_ being dismissed because it wasn't ""_B. anthracis_?"" To get around this traditional act, if it clinically looks like ""anthrax,"" do a quick plasmid DNA check. We have carried reports of anthrax-like _B. cereus_ being found in the US and Italy; see list of posts below. We must now add the Congo, and its African neighbouring states, and look forward more such reports. Never a dull moment!_Bacillus anthracis_ and _Bacillus cereus_ are closely related species. Both are soil organisms that are aerobic, rod-shaped Gram-positive spore-formers, and grow in chains. While _B. anthracis_ is the etiological agent of anthrax and has recognized potential for use as a biological weapon, _B. cereus_ can cause food poisoning that is frequently associated with the consumption of rice-based dishes and can also cause traumatic and post-surgical wound infections, bacteremia, central nervous system infections, respiratory tract infections, eye infections, and endocarditis, especially in intravenous drug abusers, immunocompromised patients, and those with prosthetic implants, such as orthopedic implants and cerebrospinal shunts._B. cereus_ are motile and hemolytic on blood agar plates, while _B. anthracis_ are non-motile and non-hemolytic. Virulent strains of _B. anthracis_ contain 2 large plasmids: pX01 and pX02 that encode toxin and capsule biosynthesis genes, respectively. From the reports above, it now seems that a group of _B. cereus_ that presents with anthrax-like disease also carries virulence plasmids similar to those of classic _B. anthracis_"" Having plasmids essentially identical to those in _B. anthracis_ will mean that the clinical signs will also match.It is wise to remember that _B. cereus_ can sometimes be something more than a mere _B. cereus_.
