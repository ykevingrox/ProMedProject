AnalÌ tica, Venezuela [in Spanish, trans. Mod.JT, edited]<http://www.analitica.com/actualidad/actualidad-nacional/se-eleva-a-15-los-casos-de-malaria-en-tres-municipios-neoespartanos/>The President of the College of physicians of Nueva Esparta State, JosÌ© Antonio Narvaez, reported 15 confirmed cases of malaria in that STATE, distributed in the municipalities of Marino, AntolÌ n del Campo, and GarcÌ a.The physician indicated that they correspond to native or autochthonous cases; that is, individuals who were infected within the state. ""Previously all the cases that were detected locally were imported, brought by people who had been in the mining areas of Bolivar state, but these [new cases] are from this area, reflecting the presence of infected _Anopheles_ mosquitoes in the state.""The former minister of health Dr JosÌ© FÌ©lix Oletta, indicated that the malaria epidemic is becoming a serious public health problem due in part to the shortage of drugs to treat it. In fact, in the last years malaria came out of its original confinement in the southern states of the country with mining activities, and already has spread to 16 federal entities, which puts 16 percent of the population at risk of infection.In 2016, there were 240 631 reported cases of malaria. Bolivar and Amazonas continue to be the states that generate most cases of this parasitic disease. Delta Amacuro, Monagas, Apure, AnzoÌÁtegui, GuÌÁrico, Barinas, and Miranda have also focal activity.The Venezuelan Observatory of health stressed in its report of December [2016] that between 3000 and 5000 cases of malaria are reported weekly in Venezuela and that 14 of the 24 states of the country are already experiencing epidemics. Moreover, the Venezuelan Society of Public Health and the Network ""Let's Defend Epidemiology"" revealed data from the Ministry of Health on the mortality caused by malaria: 150 persons died in 2016 from this disease, 15 times more than the deaths registered 4 years ago, in 2012, when there were 10 deaths.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail is closely following the evolving malaria situation in Venezuela.
