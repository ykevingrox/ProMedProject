""Three doctors who closely attended to the 1st patient later tested positive for the disease and were admitted while 135 other contacts have been followed up."" The 3 doctors admitted with confirmed Lassa Fever in LUTH have all been certified fit and discharged home because subsequent repeated tests on them showed they have now tested negative for Lassa and no longer harbour the disease,"" the CMD noted.Meanwhile over 400 LUTH staff attended a grand round on Viral Hemorrhagic Fever on [Fri 18 Aug 2017] at which various aspects of the contagious ailment were discussed.""The importance of a high-index of suspicion, early diagnosis and referral were highlighted to medical workers who were also enjoined to observe universal precautions while attending to any patient who may be suspected of having Lassa fever.""There is a fully equipped response squad available round the clock to assess and take over the management of any suspected cases in LUTH. The team has been beefed up by several volunteer staff who are working assiduously to overcome this dreaded disease and we are optimistic, buoyed by the successful discharge of those 3 doctors who had earlier tested positive.""

Transmission of Lassa fever virus in hospitals has been a long-term problem in Nigeria. One hopes that the above situations will result in putting these preventive measures into practice constantly.There is no indication of the circumstances under which the index case from Kwara state acquired the infection. Virus transmission to humans can occur when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
