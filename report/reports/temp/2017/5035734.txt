The Standard [edited]<https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001239491/inspect-meat-carefully-to-limit-chances-of-anthrax-infections>That 6 cases of anthrax are admitted to Thika Level 5 Hospital speaks volumes about our unwillingness to learn lessons from past episodes of contagion, and limit future recurrences.The authorities have done a commendable job in closing the offending slaughterhouse from which the 6 meat loaders contracted anthrax. Questions, however, must be asked about the competence and commitment of the meat inspectors who failed to isolate and destroy the infected carcasses. Because of their carelessness, an epidemic cannot be ruled out given that hundreds of people may already have consumed the infected beef. But even as we criticise the vets for sleeping on the job, we would be failing in our duty if we did not point out that livestock keepers must share their portion of the blame.It would not come as much of a surprise were it to emerge that some farmers had detected anthrax in their farms but chose to keep quiet. This is a nation where traders with the morals of alley cats have had no scruples selling zebra or donkey meat and telling customers it is beef. Trade in uninspected meat has been on the rise, even when it is clear that these products pose a serious danger to consumers.For instance, terrorists have been known to toil with the idea of weaponised anthrax as a biological weapon of mass destruction, one that is capable of wiping out a sizable chunk of a population. It is against this background that both the authorities and the citizens must treat the anthrax incidents seriously.In Thika, it is our hope that vets will trace the origins of animals slaughtered there in the recent past with a view to isolating their origin.Ultimately, the meat inspectors from the slaughterhouse where the anthrax cases were discovered will have to live with their consciences. Sloppiness and dereliction of duty have no place in decent societies, especially when they endanger the lives of Kenyans.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A very proper response by the Kenyan authorities. How the veterinary inspectors -- this report indicates that there was more than one infected carcass -- got to miss the fever signs of this animal with excess haemolytic fluid in its thoracic cavity and pericardium and an enlarged spleen evades me, and I speak as a one-time meat inspector for the Canadian government. We had animals presented at the back door of the abattoir, but it was with permission of Canada Packers, the owner, plus they underwent careful live inspection as well as a full carcass inspection on the floor. We did not accept dead animals, nor should have this abattoir in Thika, if they did.Kiambu is northwest of Nairobi; see <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/22/Kihingo.html>.
