All 3 were classified as primary cases, 2 with a known direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and one still under investigation for possible high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. These 3 cases follow an interval of 6 days with no newly confirmed cases reported.Since 1 Jan 2017, there have been 18 newly confirmed cases reported. There was a report of nosocomial transmission in Buraidah (Al Qassim region) in the early days of this month (January 2017), but today (24 Jan 2017) is now 14 days since the most recent case was reported, hence one can presume that the nosocomial transmission has been interrupted.Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the newly reported cases, fatalities, and recoveries can be found at the source URLs.
