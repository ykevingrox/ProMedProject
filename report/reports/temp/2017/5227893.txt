The Charlotte Observer, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]<http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/article165397672.html>Authorities say all the people with confirmed diagnoses of salmonellosis ate at the same cafe in north east Nebraska. The Elkhorn Logan Valley Public Health Department also reported on Thu 3 Aug 2017 that the total of confirmed cases has risen from 15 to 20 and said there are 8 probable cases.The source of the outbreak hasn't been confirmed, but the department says investigators have found a common factor among the confirmed cases: all of the people ate at Red Door Coffee in West Point. The department says the Red Door's owners and staffers are cooperating with investigators.Medical experts say salmonellosis is caused by bacteria that live in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. It usually is spread by eating contaminated food. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The total number of cases associated with this outbreak is not yet clear but seems to have been linked with a particular eating establishment in Nebraska. A food diary of what the affected and unaffected patrons of the cafÌ© had eaten can effectively identify a likely source. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62373>.]
