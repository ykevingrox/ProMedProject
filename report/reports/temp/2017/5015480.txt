Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/04/c_136257434.htm>An outbreak of cholera/acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) in Somalia has killed 618 people since January 2017, the UN humanitarian agency said on [Thu 4 May 2017]. The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest bulletin that the AWD/cholera outbreak is affecting 13 out of 18 Somali regions.The OCHA attributed the outbreak to widespread water shortages, food insecurity and displacement that have stretched sanitation facilities beyond their capacity. ""Nearly 32 000 AWD/cholera cases and 618 related deaths have been reported since the start of 2017,"" said the UN agency.The vulnerable children and adults, already struggling to cope with malnutrition and food insecurity caused in large part by the failure of 2016's 2 rainy seasons, were struck down by the deadly disease after drinking contaminated water, it said. The OCHA said most cases were reported from Banadir, Togdheer, Lower Shabelle, Hiraan, Sool, Mudug, and Lower Juba regions, noting that reporting and verification in places such as Middle Juba have been hampered by difficult access.""The current mass population displacement as a result of droughts is worsening the situation. The onset of the rainy season risks exacerbating the situation further in the hotspots and along the riverine areas,"" it said.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Somalia can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/somalia.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/125>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Cholera - South SudanDate: Sun 30 Apr 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, UNICEF report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/unicef-south-sudan-humanitarian-situation-report-108-16-30-april-2017>UNICEF South Sudan humanitarian situation report no. 108, 16-30 Apr 2017-------------------------------------------------------------------84 cholera cases were reported among cattle camp populations in Awerial (Dor), Yirol East (Tharnuar), and Ayod (Buol and Tar). UNICEF continued its integrated response to cholera outbreak in affected cattle camps curtailing transmission in hot spots of Duk, Jonglei.The security situation across the country remains unstable. The areas of Upper Nile, Jonglei, Greater Equatoria, and Northern Bahr el Ghazal remain volatile with violent clashes between the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the SPLA in Opposition (SPLA-iO). The volatile security situation is impacting humanitarian access, leaving vulnerable populations unable to reach life-saving services.Insecurity in Wau town has triggered an influx of over 20 000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Wau town and the surrounding areas, resulting in congestion in existing settlements. This further strained already limited water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and can create an environment for communicable diseases to spread further, especially with the cholera outbreak in many locations of South Sudan. UNICEF with partners, is responding by providing the additional WASH facilities for new arrivals.During the 3rd week of April 2017, new cholera cases have been reported from Awerial (66 cases) and Yirol East and West counties (8 cases) in Lakes state as well as from Ayod, northern Jonglei (7 cases). No new cases have been reported from Duk, where cholera transmission was confirmed earlier in April 2017. Since the 1st cholera case of the 2016/2017 outbreak was confirmed on 18 Jun 2016 in Juba, 6774 cases including 221 deaths (70 from health facilities and 151 from the community; case fatality rate 3.25 per cent) have been reported from 18 counties across the country. The case spike is attributable to a cholera outbreak in the Mamour cattle camp in Duk, which was in a swampy area where the herdsmen sought water and pasture for their cattle. As pastures reduce and seasonal water streams dry up during the dry season, the cattle camps gravitate and converge on the remaining water source usually in the swampy areas along the Nile. The consumption of this water caused the spike in cases.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of South Sudan can be seen at <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/28_States_of_South_Sudan.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]*****[3] Cholera - Sudan (White Nile)Date: Fri 5 May 2017Source: AllAfrica, Radio Dabanga [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201705050201.html>The Sudanese health minister, Bahr Idris Abu Garda, has announced that the number of cholera cases in White Nile state is decreasing, following chlorination of drinking water. During a visit to the cholera-stricken area, minister Abu Garda and that ""the situation has been controlled in the White Nile state by interventions in the chlorination of drinking water.""Cholera spreads easily via contaminated drinking water, especially stagnant water. The minister said that ""Um Jar area has only 2 cases and 20 cases at Kunouz area.""Abu Garda claims that there have been no deaths for more than a week. He stressed that ""the fundamental solution is to solve the problem of contaminated water by chlorination of stations and water within the entire network"". He said another challenge is the water sources outside the network which require considerable chlorination efforts.Meanwhile the health minister of White Nile state, Babikir Al Makbul, has reported a total of 12 dead and 973 infections in the state since 8 Apr 2017. His report does not mention the date of the last death.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*****[4] Cholera - Haiti, Dominican RepublicDate: Thu 4 May 2017Source: Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) [edited]<http://www2.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=39836>Cholera in the Americas - situation summary-------------------------------------------Between epidemiological weeks (EW) 1 and 14 of 2017 [1 Jan-7 Apr 2017], a total of 4871 suspected cholera cases were reported in Haiti, including 69 deaths. During the same period, 62 suspected cholera cases were reported in the Dominican Republic, including 2 deaths.The 4871 cases reported in Haiti represent a 60 per cent and 61 per cent decrease compared to the 12 373 and 12 226 suspected cholera cases reported during the same period in 2015 and 2016, respectively (Figure 1 [for figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Figure 2 shows that this decrease has been constant over the 14-week period. The 69 deaths reported in 2017 represents a 41 per cent and 50 per cent decrease compared to the 116 and 139 deaths reported during the same period in 2015 and 2016, respectively. For the 1st 14 weeks of 2017, the in-hospital case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.2 per cent compared to 0.9 per cent for the whole of 2016 and 0.8 per cent for the whole of 2015.All 10 departments of Haiti have reported suspected cholera cases during 2017. Between EW 11 and 14 of 2017 [11 Mar-7 Apr 2017], the rates of notified cases ranged from 39.5 to 3.2 per 100 000 population. The 5 departments with the highest rates in descending order are: Centre, Ouest (which includes the capital city of Port-au-Prince), Nippes, Artibonite, and Nord.Similarly, the 62 suspected cholera cases reported in the Dominican Republic between EW 1 and EW 14 of 2017 [1 Jan-7 Apr 2017] represents a 73 per cent and 91 per cent decrease compared to the same period in 2015 and 2016. In fact, 679 suspected cases were reported in 2016 and 229 in 2015. While 2 deaths have been reported in 2017, 15 and 10 deaths were reported in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Overall CFR is 3.2 per cent in 2017, 2.2 per cent in 2016, and 4.4 per cent in 2015. While 20 provinces (included the capital district) reported cases in 2016, only 10 provinces have reported cases in 2017.--communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp[A HealthMap/ProMED mail interactive map of Haiti and the Dominican Republic is available at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJContaminated water remains the major risk factor for the acquisition of _Vibrio cholerae_. As reported in Africa (currently in the Horn of Africa) periods of flooding and drought increase the risk of outbreaks. As demonstrated in Haiti the introduction of cholera into a country with a destroyed sanitary system and no underlying immunity can cause a major epidemic. In the classical endemic areas such as the Indian subcontinent and other areas in Asia, rainy reasons often accentuate the number of cases. Acute watery diarrhea is often used as an alternative term for cholera, the primary cause of outbreaks of watery diarrhea with fatalities in adults. - Mod.LL]
