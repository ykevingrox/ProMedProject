But none have been found to carry the virus so far.Hanley, along with NMSU students and researchers from the university's departments of biology and geography, are in the 2nd year of a research project for the New Mexico Department of Health. David Morgan, spokesman for the state Department of Health, said the partnership stemmed from a USD 1.7 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""This partnership has been immensely important,"" Morgan said. ""It's an opportunity to be able to map out what breeds of mosquitoes are living in the southern part of our state.""Hanley said _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ have only been discovered in urban areas. ""We found none (in rural areas),"" she said. ""We were certainly not happy to find that in Carlsbad. More than half of the sites were positive of _Aedes aegypti_.""Michaela Buenemann, associate professor in NMSU's department of geography, said that, currently, researchers are trying to identify whether populations of the mosquito can be found in high numbers in industrial, residential, or commercial areas. That information, as well as why they occur in certain areas, may help county vector control departments, she said.Hanley said the official origin of _Aedes aegypti_ and_Aedes albopictus_ are currently under investigation, but the Zika-transmitting mosquitoes are seen the most in southern New Mexico.The list of counties where they breed may expand as the research continues, she said. The mosquitoes are slowly migrating north and have most recently been identified in Socorro County. The list of counties where the mosquitoes are reported has now grown to 10 New Mexico counties: Socorro, Sierra, Hidalgo, Luna, Dona Ana, Otero, Chaves, Eddy, Lea and Roosevelt.The insects' activity typically ends as late as October following regional monsoonal rains. ""It's a perfect storm for the mosquitoes, because monsoon season started soon (this year [2017]),"" Hanley said.Hanley said the 2 species were identified 2 months prior to the start of their typical July season. The species are hard to misidentify: _Aedes aegypti_ can be identified by a white pattern on its back, which appears to be a Greek lyre, and _Aedes albopictus_ has distinct white stripes.The trapping research team, which traps the insects and tests for pathogens and bacteria, has visited Carlsbad and Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Of those insects trapped, some are used to test resistance to pesticides to determine which is more effective.Buenemann their job is to determine the mosquitoes' distribution. To that end, she is working on a mapping project. Data from the trapping research is used to create land-cover maps. ""We don't know where within cities they occur,"" she said.Hanley and Buenemann each said they hope to have more information on the risks to the regions where they are conducting their research as they continue the project over the next few months.[Byline: DeJanay Booth]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_ Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found in southern New Mexico counties in earlier years, including in Eddy county. Although finding _Ae. aegypti_ in this county is not surprising, the number of breeding sites found in Carlsbad municipality is of concern.In the above report, more than half of the sites in urban Carlsbad were positive for _Aedes aegypti_. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in New Mexico. Both have been detected in southern New Mexico. Thus far, no locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection in New Mexico have been documented. These mosquito species have been found in several locations in the USA this year (2017).Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of viruses such as Zika, chikungunya, or dengue into New Mexico will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233> and a map showing the location of Eddy county can be accessed at: <http://geology.com/county-map/new-mexico.shtml>. - Mod.TY]
