Western Advocate [edited]<http://www.westernadvocate.com.au/story/4472719/the-sydney-suburbs-hit-hardest-by-surging-ross-river-virus-outbreak/?cs=4189>Scientists believe NSW [New South Wales] may be coming to the end of the biggest season for Ross River virus in living memory, after inland flooding in spring created the perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes that carry the disease. More than 5 times as many people contracted the virus in December [2016] and January [2017] than did over the same period last year, with 560 notifications compared to 96 last year [2016]. In the first 6 weeks of this year [2017] alone, 430 people have been affected.The virus causes fever, headaches, chills and stiffness in the muscles in joints, and though it usually resolves within 10 days some patients experience symptoms for months.The NSW opposition has called on the government to consider targeted spraying of areas in which those mosquitoes breed, including the tidal areas of the Georges River, Parramatta River and Hawkesbury River. The Riverina area, particularly the towns of Albury and Griffith, has been hardest hit, but cases have also been identified in the Hunter-New England and suburbs around the Georges River, including Alfreds Point, Lugarno and Illawong.NSW Health Pathology senior scientist Stephen Doggett said heavy flooding in the early part of the season had given rise to a huge number of mosquitoes across the inland regions, and a substantial increase in Ross River Virus notifications had been noted from November [2016].""We've seen a massive amount of mosquitoes - probably the highest we've ever seen,"" Mr. Doggett said. ""Extraordinary numbers. And we've seen a massive increase in reports of Ross River virus through the months of December [2016] and January [2017]. They were many, many times higher than our previous records and we've been doing this work since the late 80s. Now because we've had this hot dry weather mosquito numbers are dropping off and we're starting to see a bit of a decline in cases, but still last week there were 82 cases which is more than double the month's average in 1 week. It appears that the virus has exploded and now it's burnt itself out.""Opposition health spokesman Walt Secord said the health minister Brad Hazzard should step up education campaigns to prevent mosquitoborne illnesses. ""NSW is in the grip of a serious Ross River fever outbreak,"" Mr. Secord said. ""It is a preventable illness and we want the state government to consider undertaking targeting spraying and other preventative measures.""The virus is mostly confined to the west of the Great Dividing Range where saltmarsh mosquitoes breed, but it has also been detected today [16 Feb 2017] in river areas such as the Georges River and Parramatta River. However, the disease is believed to be spread by mosquitoes that have bitten wallabies and kangaroos that carry the disease, so it is less prevalent in urban environments where there are fewer marsupial carriers.Mr Doggett said he supported targeted spraying of mosquito larvae in areas where the disease was prevalent, but the cost of AUD 5000 [USD 3750] per treatment was prohibitive for regional councils. The total bill could climb to AUD 30 000 [USD 22 500] for a season, he said. ""As a mosquito person I would say, yes, undertaking larval control would reduce the disease burden, but when you go to inland NSW you're talking about huge, huge hectares and huge cost and this is why it gets difficult.""NSW Health advises people to protect themselves against infection by wearing long-sleeved clothes and insect repellent and using netting, mosquito coils and plug-in devices. It said in a statement that it had issued statewide public alerts when it detected increased mosquito numbers in its routine disease surveillance. ""In response to increasing mosquito numbers following floods, NSW Health added additional sites to trap mosquitoes in affected areas, provided information to affected communities and GPs, and advised local governments to inform ongoing mosquito management,"" the statement said. ""NSW Health also convened a panel of experts to review information and predictive models to inform the best preventive strategies. There is little evidence that broad-scale spraying is useful in these situations and, the main prevention focus is local control measures along with advice on personal protection.""[byline: Harriet Alexander]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although this report came to us just now and is 3 weeks old, it provides a good summary of the Ross River virus (RRV) situation in the state of New South Wales.As noted in previous comments, RRV infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy, as they have been currently in New South Wales. RRV infection cases also occur at times in Victoria and Western Australia. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.
