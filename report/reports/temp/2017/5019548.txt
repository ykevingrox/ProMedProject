In Pakistan, overall 11 cases of this virus have been reported in 2017, of which 4 patients recovered and 2 and one died from the confirmed and suspected virus, respectively. 5 people were discharged with no diagnosis of the illness.The virus is [a _Nairovirus_ of the Bunyaviridae family, which spreads] from ticks or through contact with the blood or other fluids from infected animals and humans. In Pakistan, this virus was first reported from the regions of Balochistan and KPK [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] in 1976; at that time it was not a much prevalent disease but up to 2000, its victims increased and now the death toll in Balochistan has increased to 91.There is no known vaccine for this virus to use in animals but in the case of humans, this fever can be treated using ribavirin, which is an antiviral drug. Ribavirin can be given both orally and intravenously as prescribed by the physician.[Byline: Haider Ali Sindhu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[As mentioned in the report, the suspected case died before any sampling could be done for laboratory confirmation. However, CCHF prevalence is highest in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and cases have also been reported from southern Punjab and Sindh.Generally the case numbers of CCHF go up in the country from May onwards, due to a multitude of causes, including warmer climates, increased tick activity, increase in human and animal movements, etc.CCHF provides the perfect opportunity for multi-sectoral collaboration in implementing control measures by both human and livestock/animal health sectors. - Mod.UBAMaps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://pakistanmap.facts.co/pakistanmapof/PakistanAdministrative> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1527>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
