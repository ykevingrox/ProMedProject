Dawn news<https://www.dawn.com/news/1320181/polio-case-detected>    Polio case detected-------------------A fresh case of polio disease was reported on Saturday [11 Mar 2017] in Diamer district of Gilgit- Baltistan [GB] after a gap of 6 years.According to GB health department officials, the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, confirmed poliovirus in a 14-month-old [boy], a resident of Thore valley of district Diamer.  GB had been declared free of polio virus in 2012.An official of the GB health department told Dawn that the child was admitted to a government hospital after being inflicted by poliovirus at his home.  Later, the boy's sample was sent to NIH, Islamabad, for confirmation of the virus.  The NIH confirmed on Saturday [11 Mar 2017] detection of poliovirus, after 4 months.After the detection poliovirus, the GB health department, through a text message, asked health officials and medical doctors in districts of Gilgit and Diamer to launch an emergency anti-polio campaign from [16 to 19 Mar 2017].  For this campaign, a workshop for health supervisors had been organised in Gilgit on [14 Mar 2017].According to a GB health department official, the World Health Organisation officials in Pakistan had expressed dissatisfaction over emergence of poliovirus in GB despite spending billions of rupees [1 USD =104.8 PKR] in the region for eradication of the crippling disease.The official said WHO had constituted a team which would visit GB to investigate how the negligence had been committed despite providing technical assistance to GB health department for eradicating the disease.[Byline: Jamil Nagri]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Global update - Polio Eradication InitiativeDate: 9 Mar 2017Source: Polio Eradication Initiative<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Polio eradication this week (as of 8 Mar 2017):Wild poliovirus type 1 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases:Total cases: YTD*-2017: WPV** / cVDPV*** // YTD*-2016: WPV** / cVDPV*** // Total in 2016: WPV** / cVDPV***Globally: 3 / 0 // 5 / 2 // 37 / 5 - in endemic countries: 3 / 0 // 5 / 0 // 37 / 2- in non-endemic countries: 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 3* YTD - year to date** WPV - wild poliovirus*** cVDPV - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirusCase breakdown by country:Countries: YTD-2017: WPV / cVDPV // YTD-2016: WPV / cVDPV // Total 2016: WPV / cVDPV // Onset paralysis most recent case: WPV / CVDPVAfghanistan: 2 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 2 / 13 // 21 Jan 2017 / NALao PDR: 0 / 0 // 0 / 2 // 0 / 3 // NA / 10 Jan 2016Nigeria: 0 / 0 // 0 / 0 // 4 / 1 // 20 Aug 2016 / 27 Oct 2016Pakistan: 1 / 0 // 5 / 0 // 20 / 1 // 27 Jan 2017 / 16 Dec 2016NA: onset of paralysis in most recent case is prior to 2015.Figures exclude non-AFP sources.cVDPV definition: see document ""Reporting and classification of vaccine-derived polioviruses"" at <http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VDPV_ReportingClassification.pdf>Afghanistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 2, and for 2016 remains 13. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2017], from Nahr-e-Saraj district, Helmand.- Most areas of Afghanistan are without polio cases, but wild poliovirus continues to circulate in localized geographical areas in the eastern and south eastern regions of the country. Two geographical areas are of particular importance: Bermel district in Paktika province, and Sheegal district in Kunar, which reported 11 of the 13 polio cases in 2016.- Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to be treated as a single epidemiological block.Pakistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains one, and for 2016 remains 20. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [28 Jan 2017], from Lodhran district, Punjab.- No new environmental positive samples were reported in the past week.- The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range.- Efforts continue in Quetta Block to strengthen programme operations as well as supervision and monitoring mechanisms to stop transmission of WPV1 and VDPV2.Nigeria- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains four. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.- Nigeria continues to implement emergency outbreak response, in response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country.- The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighbouring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger.- Detection of polio cases underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.Guinea and West Africa- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016 or 2017. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is seven.- While it has been more than a year since the last case had onset of paralysis in Guinea, undetected circulation cannot be ruled out. A recently-conducted surveillance review in the country found significant improvements to surveillance sensitivity, though some remaining subnational gaps.- Critical to long-term success will be to ensure that capacity and infrastructure is maintained to rapidly detect, and respond to, any potential further virus isolates.Lao People's Democratic Republic- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type one (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3 in 2016 and 8 in 2015.- An outbreak response assessment was conducted last week in the country, reviewing epidemiological and surveillance data. The assessment found significant improvements, in particular in surveillance, and concluded that it is unlikely that transmission is continuing in the country.- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The above reports represent good news and bad news.  The good news is that reported cases of poliomyelitis worldwide are down from last year (2016).  According to last week's Polio Eradication Initiative's update, as of 8 Mar 2017 there have been a total of 3 WPV associated cases of poliomyelitis reported this year (2017) as compared with 5 reported during the same period last year (2016). All 3 cases come from polio-endemic countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan). The potentially bad news is that according to the media report, a case was detected in Gilgit-Baltistan, a province that has been polio-free since 2011 when the last case was reported.  It will be interesting to see the genetic studies on the poliovirus identified - the media report does not mention if the poliovirus was a wild poliovirus (WPV) or a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV).  In either case (WPV vs cVDPV) both are symptomatic of pockets of unvaccinated individuals that permit the circulation of the virus among susceptibles.  It is also possible this case might be a vaccine associated paralytic case in an immunologically compromised individual, in which case, receipt of the vaccine (in a 14 month old) might lead to paralytic disease as well as prolonged excretion of the virus.  More information on the laboratory findings on the virus isolated would be greatly appreciated.Gilgit-Baltistan, was formerly known as the Northern Areas and is the northernmost administrative territory of Pakistan.  It borders Azad Kashmir to the south, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west, the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north, the Xinjiang region of China, to the east and northeast, and the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir to the southeast. Gilgit-Baltistan is part of the region that is disputed by India and Pakistan, along with Azad Kashmir, Aksai Chin, the Shaksgam Valley, and Jammu, Ladakh, and the Valley of Kashmir.
