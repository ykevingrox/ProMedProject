The Guelph health unit is going to be giving local caterers some tips on how to roast a pig safely after 22 people got sick at a private party in May 2017.""We are reaching out to all local caterers that do pig roasts, because they are very common, and we're going some education around the care of the meat,"" Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health communications manager Chuck Ferguson said on [Tue 5 Sep 2017]. The additional education is part of WDG Public Health's response to an outbreak of a foodborne gastrointestinal illness that came to the health unit's attention in June 2017. A report on the subsequent public health investigation was set to go to the [Wed 6 Sep 2017] meeting of the board of health.According to the report, the health unit was notified of a positive case of _Campylobacter jejuni_, a bacterium that can cause diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain and fever, on [Fri 9 Jun 2017]. A 2nd positive case was reported to the local health unit from Waterloo Region Public Health on [Mon 12 Jun 2017], and this person had said they had attended a catered pig roast in Guelph on [Tue 30 May 2017]. After the local health unit learned that both people had attended the same event, a formal investigation was initiated, the report said.Of the 82 people who had attended the event, WDG Public Health interviewed 74, and of those interviewed, 33 per cent reported they had experienced illness since attending the pig roast, it said. Ferguson said 22 people got sick in the outbreak.It could have been worse. ""Leftover food items from the pig roast were delivered, the following morning, to a drop-in centre located in Guelph,"" the report said. ""Individuals accessing the services provided by this facility represent a vulnerable subset of our population, increasing their risk of illness.""[Byline: Jessica Lovell]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Undercooked chicken and beef and unpasteurized milk are the most common sources for human campylobacteriosis. The species identified in this cluster associated with a Canadian pig roast was _C. jejuni_ however _C. coli_ appears to be the most dominant species in swine, not _C. jejuni_ as reported by:Boes J, Nersting L, Nielsen EM, et al. Prevalence and diversity of Campylobacter jejuni in pig herds on farms with and without cattle or poultry. J Food Prot. 2005;68: 722-7.Abstract--------""The prevalence and diversity of _Campylobacter jejuni_ was investigated in pig herds on farms with and without cattle or poultry production. A bacteriological screening of pig cecal samples from 247 finisher herds was carried out at the slaughter-house. Subsequently, a follow-up study was conducted in 24 herds (either with or without prior _C. jejuni_ isolation from pigs) in which fecal samples were collected from pigs and, if present, cattle and poultry. Samples were analyzed for presence of _Campylobacter_, and subsequent analysis included species identification, serotyping, and, for selected strains, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing. In the slaughterhouse screening, _C. jejuni_ was isolated from pigs in 21 (8.5 per cent) herds, but no significant difference in prevalence was found between herd types (pigs, pigs and cattle, pigs and poultry). At the slaughterhouse, _C. jejuni_ and _Campylobacter coli_ prevalence in pigs was 2.3 and 90.1 per cent, respectively. In the follow-up study, herd prevalence of _C. jejuni_ was 8.3 per cent, whereas _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_ were isolated from 0.8 and 92.0 per cent of pigs, respectively. In mixed production herds, _C. jejuni_ predominated in cattle (42.7 per cent) and poultry (31.6 per cent), whereas _C. jejuni_ was only isolated from 1.3 to 2.5% of pigs in these herds. There were no significant differences in _C. jejuni_ or _C. coli_ prevalence in pigs, cattle, and poultry between herds with and without prior _C. jejuni_ isolation at the slaughterhouse. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing did not yield evidence of _C. jejuni_ transmission between cattle or poultry and pigs in mixed production herds. In contrast, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed indistinguishable serotypes of _C. coli_ in pigs and cattle in two herds. Verification of _C. jejuni_-positive pig samples showed that individual pigs can excrete high levels of _C. jejuni_ and that mixed infection with _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_ was common in _C. jejuni_-positive pigs. The results of our study suggest that transmission of _C. jejuni_ between pigs and cattle or poultry in mixed production herds occurs infrequently. Detection of indistinguishable _C. coli_ isolates in 2 herds, however, might indicate the existence of low-level transmission between pigs and cattle in herds of mixed production.""This report from Germany strongly suggests that _jejuni_ is not at all a common human infection to be linked to swine whereas _C. coli_ certainly can be:Rosner BM, Schielke A, Didelot X, et al. A combined case-control and molecular source attribution study of human Campylobacter infections in Germany, 2011-2014. Sci Rep. 2017;7(1): 5139. Available at:<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505968/>.Abstract--------""_Campylobacter_ infection is the most commonly notified bacterial enteritis in Germany. We performed a large combined case-control and source attribution study (Nov 2011-Feb 2014) to identify risk factors for sporadic intestinal _Campylobacter_ infections and to determine the relative importance of various animal sources for human infections in Germany. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors. Source attribution analysis was performed using the asymmetric island model based on MLST data of human and animal/food isolates. As animal sources we considered chicken, pig, pet dog or cat, cattle, and poultry other than chicken. Consumption of chicken meat and eating out were the most important risk factors for _Campylobacter_ infections. Additional risk factors were preparation of poultry meat in the household; preparation of uncooked food and raw meat at the same time; contact with poultry animals; and the use of gastric acid inhibitors. The mean probability of human _C. jejuni_ isolates to originate from chickens was highest (74 per cent), whereas pigs were a negligible source for _C. jejuni_ infections. Human _C. coli_ isolates were likely to originate from chickens (56 per cent) or from pigs (32 per cent). Efforts need to be intensified along the food chain to reduce _Campylobacter_ load, especially on chicken meat."" Given that the episode occurred in May 2017 at the beginning of warm weather when pig roasts are likely to occur, it is surprising that only now when the warm weather is ending that reports of the episode are occurring.
