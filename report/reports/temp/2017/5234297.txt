In the last 2 days, 16 new cases of AES and 3 deaths were reported from Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, the largest in the district. However, the hospital and district health officials are claiming that the situation is much better than in the previous years.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the Gorakhpur district, and eastern Uttar Pradesh state generally, have been localities of many cases of JE and AES in recent years, this is the 1st report from those locations this year (2017).As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined.The above report does not indicate whether JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year [2017]. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report does not indicate what the etiologies of the AES cases might be. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>.
