Alghad Press [in Arabic, trans. Mod.NS, edited]<https://www.alghadpress.com/news/Iraq-News/119679/AlghadPress>The Parliamentary Health and Environment Committee revealed on [Sun 24 Sep 2017] the spread of plague and called for a national campaign against rodents that are causing the disease.The deputy head of the Parliamentary Health and Environment Committee, Fares Al-Barefkani, told Alghad Press that ""new cases of plague have been identified, and the causes of the disease are known and are related to the poor municipal, disease control, sewage, and landfill services, in addition to widespread residential slums.""Al-Barefkani indicated that ""there are a lot of residential slums that have emerged and are not under the control of Baghdad municipality and lack health services."" He called for ""a serious national campaign to combat rodents in the residential neighborhoods that cause plague and provide medicines that help to eliminate the disease"" and stressed that ""there is a need to support Baghdad municipality and the health and the environment directorates to educate people on how to combat plague.""Al-Barefkani added that ""the Parliamentary Health and Environment Committee does not have accurate data on the number of cases because we are in the process of follow-up in all the governorates.""On Tuesday [12 Sep 2017], the Ministry of Health denied some social media and other media reports about the occurrence of plague cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>viavia ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[ProMED would again appreciate more information regarding whether plague cases have occurred in Iraq as it had been previously denied. If plague is present there, a program to eradicate rodents alone will not be effective in preventing human cases as the infected flea vector will seek other blood sources, such as humans.This publication regarding the history of _Yersinia pestis_ in Iran also reviews the history of plague in other countries in the Middle East including Iraq:Hashemi Shahraki A, Carniel E, Mostafavi E: Plague in Iran: its history and current status. Epidemiol Health. 2016 Jul 24; 38: e2016033; available at <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037359/>.""Throughout its history, Iraq has experienced multiple epidemics of plague. In 716 and 717 CE, a large outbreak known as al-Ashraf (the Notables) was recorded in Iraq and Syria. In an epidemic of bubonic plague in 1772 and 1773, many victims died in cities such as Basra (with 250 000 deaths) and Mosul. In 1801 CE, a large plague epidemic occurred in Mosul and Baghdad. A plague epidemic occurred again in Baghdad in 1908. From 1923 to 1924, approximately 90 cases of pneumonic plague were reported in Baghdad, and some plague outbreaks were reported in Basra."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54548>.]
