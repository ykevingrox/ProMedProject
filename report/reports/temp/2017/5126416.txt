El Pitazo [in Spanish, machine trans., summ., edited] <https://elpitazo.com/regiones/17-casos-difteria-hospital-universitario-maracaibo/>The right wing of the 8th floor of the University Hospital of Maracaibo (HUM) was closed and there are 17 cases of confirmed and suspected cases of diphtheria in Maracaibo. In hospital's area of outpatient consultation, 485 employees were vaccinated on [Tue 20 Jun 2017] and remain on alert for the implications and how fast the contagion has spread.Although the majority of confirmed and suspected cases are on the 8th floor, patients are also said to be in floors 6 and 7 and they will be isolated in the coming hours. Among those infected are a 3-year-old boy, an orderly, and the secretary of the head of the Hospital Support Division who has an office on the 6th floor.Of the group, 3 are in serious condition, according to a hospital source. ""Those who work here are terrified. The critical areas are emergency, hospitalization, and laboratory, although work is being carried out normally and as a precaution, only masks are being used.""As a recommendation, a doctor notes that to prevent diphtheria the 1st barrier method to be used is to use masks and wash hands, because there are no vaccines.""We do not have mortality data and we can [only] talk about definitive cases when the bacteria are isolated, demonstrated by microscopy or antibodies are demonstrated in the patients' serum.""Diphtheria:- acute infection of the nose and throat that can be easily prevented with a vaccine;- can be prevented with a vaccine;- a film of a thick gray [membrane] covers the back of the throat and makes breathing difficult;- symptoms are sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and weakness;- treatment includes the use of antibiotics and an antitoxin that neutralizes the diphtheria toxin. The vaccine exists and is available.Data:- 7000 employees work in the University Hospital and only 15 percent received the vaccine;- 2500 people visit the University Hospital of Maracaibo daily;- 17 confirmed and suspected cases have been admitted to the health center.[Byline: Sheyla Urdaneta]--Communicated byKathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters ""DT"") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, ""Td"") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap).In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf>). The fully immunized person who is exposed can become an asymptomatic carrier of the bacterium or develop only a mild illness. But if not fully vaccinated, the risk of getting severely ill is 30 times higher (<http://www.vaccinews.net/diseases_vaccines.php>).The organism that causes diphtheria, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, produces a toxin that is responsible both for local tissue destruction and membrane formation in the nose and throat and the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis. Diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin to stop the effects of the toxin and antibiotics to eradicate the organism.Diphtheria patients are usually kept in isolation until they are no longer contagious, that is, about 48 hours after starting antibiotics, as demonstrated by negative cultures of 2 samples obtained at least 24 hours apart after completion of antimicrobial therapy (<https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/close-contacts.pdf>).Maps of Venezuela can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/venezuela.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5164>. Maracaibo is the 2nd largest city in Venezuela, with a population of about 1.5 million residents; it is located in northwestern Venezuela, on the western shore of the strait that connects Lake Maracaibo to the Gulf of Venezuela and is the capital of the state of Zulia. - Mod.MLAccording to a news report dated 12 Feb 2017, at the end of last year (2016), the Venezuelan Society of Public Health and the ""Let's Defend Epidemiology"" network, reported more than 200 cases in the states of Bolivar, Monagas, Sucre, Miranda, and Anzoategui (<http://www.correodelcaroni.com/index.php/mas/salud/item/53568-nina-de-pariaguan-muere-de-difteria-en-hospital-de-san-felix>, in Spanish). In addition to the reports of vaccine shortages, there are also reports of anti-toxin and antibiotic shortages contributing to the outbreak (<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-health-idUSKBN15P1DA?il=0>). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ/Mod.JH]
