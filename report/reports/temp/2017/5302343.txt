Researchers found that children with higher blood levels of the chemicals known to be in the dust had elevated levels of artery-hardening fats in their blood.The scientists' report is set to appear in the journal Environment International online [Thu 7 Sept 2017].""Since 9/11 (2001), we have focused a lot of attention on the psychological and mental fallout from witnessing the tragedy, but only now are the potential physical consequences of being within the disaster zone itself becoming clear,"" says study lead investigator and health epidemiologist Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP, an associate professor at NYU School of Medicine.Study children who were more likely to be exposed to the dust, mostly young adults now, were enrollees in the World Trade Center Health Registry (WTCHR), which is helping to track the physical and mental health, through annual check-ups, of nearly 2900 children who either lived or attended school in Lower Manhattan on 9/11.According to Trasande, his study is the 1st to suggest long-term cardiovascular health risks in children from toxic chemical exposure on 9/11.He says the long-term danger may stem from exposure to certain perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFASs -- chemicals released into the air as electronics and furniture burned in the disaster. These include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), widely used to make plastics more flexible until its health effects, including lower-than-normal birthweights and brain damage, led U.S. manufacturers to stop using it in 2014.An analysis by Trasande in January 2017 showed that the same 123 children in the WTCHR had significantly higher PFOA blood levels than 185 children who were not living or studying in the city on the day of the attack.Among the latest study's results was that roughly every 3-fold increase in blood PFOA levels was tied to an average 9 percent to 15 percent increase in blood fats, including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.According to Trasande, raised fat levels in the blood, especially LDL, are known risk factors for heart disease and can if left unchecked lead to blood vessel blockages and heart attack.Fortunately, he says, these very early signs of cardiovascular risk observed in the WTCHR children can generally be addressed by diet, weight control, and exercise.""Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring the health consequences from 9/11 in children exposed to the dust, and offers hope that early intervention can alleviate some of the dangers to health posed by the disaster,"" says Trasande.In another study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in June [2017], a different research team at NYU found raised blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in people who reported being exposed to WTC dust on 9/11. Previous research has linked increases in CRP to inflammation and higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study involved 641 men and women whose health was being monitored at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue for effects linked to 9/11. Researchers found that people with raised CRP had a 12 percent greater risk of PTSD than people whose CRP was not elevated.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[PFAS (perfluoroalkyl substances,) and PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) are often known as C8, synthetic substances used as an emulsifier, in plastic making, and are found in multiple aspects of our daily life. They are persistent in the environment and are known carcinogens. They are capable of bioaccumulation and multiple health issues.According to a 2014 EPA report: [PFOA and PFOS] are extremely persistent in the environment and resistant to typical environmental degradation processes. [They] are widely distributed across the higher trophic levels and are found in soil, air and groundwater at sites across the United States. The toxicity, mobility and bioaccumulation potential of PFOS and PFOA pose potential adverse effects for the environment and human health.--ÛäUSEPA March 2014 page 1.A variety of products exist which have these C8 compounds in them. The list is long and includes such things as pre-treated carpets, and their corresponding carpet care cleaners and liquids, treated upholstery, some floor waxes, especially the commercial waxes and sealants, some dental floss and dental tape, and the sealants for wood, tiles and stones and many more items.Others sources include some foods, food packaging (such as the microwave popcorn bags where these substances are coating the packaging to prevent the oils from soaking through the paper), drinking waters, indoor air (perhaps from upholstery and carpets?). Many food contact papers have some type of C8 in them. It is unclear which method of delivery can produce problems. However, it is known if drinking water is the source it readily shows in the blood at levels higher than other products. Nonstick pans with PTFE had negligible PFOA. Nevertheless, from the other products we come in contact with, it appears all of us could have some level of PFAs/PFOAs in us.These substances have been shown to be carcinogenic, have effects on hormones, immunological status, thyroid functioning, endocrine disruption, and a host of other problems. Some of those include low birth rates, neonatal mortality, and altered lipid metabolism.So if these young adult children were exposed to high levels in the dust, as well as in everyday food and living issues, then their levels may be particularly high and at those potentially high levels we may not have good data as to what these individuals may be expected to experience. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.].................................................tg/ec/mpp"
