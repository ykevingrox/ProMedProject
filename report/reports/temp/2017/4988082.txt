The case is a man who lives in the CochamÌ  community, who was bitten by a rodent that is assumed to be the long-tailed species [long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_], and now had a positive rapid test for [a] hantavirus [infection].The Health SEREMI [local ministerial administrative unit], Eugenia Schnake, confirmed the suspected case when pointing out that the exams were sent to the laboratory in Valdivia [central reference laboratory for hantavirus infection diagnosis], and also was calling on the population to follow the prevention measures to avoid infection with the virus.The man was taken to the Puerto Montt hospital, where he remains admitted and is in stable condition.Besides, it should be pointed out that to date the Los Lagos region has registered 9 confirmed cases of hantavirus infections.[Byline: Claudio WekÌ©n, published by Alejandro AlarcÌ n]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although reports of the previous cases that have occurred in the Los Lagos region provided no information about the circumstances under which the hantavirus infection might have been acquired, in the current case the man was bitten by a rodent that may well be the source of his infection. The other cases may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in this environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>. - Mod.TY]
