Many residents preferred it because it was cheap but they ignored health risks.On [Wed 19 Jul 2017], villagers started flooding Muriranjas Hospital, all complaining of severe pain. There were initial fears they were suffering from [gastrointestinal] anthrax. Kairo Kimende, who is in charge of the facility, said though the patients exhibited symptoms similar to those of anthrax. However, tests revealed they were suffering from severe food poisoning. ""We took samples from the patients that have indicated that they are only suffering from bacterial food poisoning,"" he added.The residents were screened and discharged. Two were admitted to Kiria-Ini Mission Hospital after suffering from severe headache and stomach pains.After having a meal with his family later in the day, one patient reported that he started suffering from diarrhea and stomach ache. ""Most of us who fell sick decided to wait and see if the symptoms would subside, but they kept getting worse,"" he said. His wife and child were also infected. They were treated and discharged.County director of Public Health John Mwaniki said a team of public health officers have been dispatched to the village to establish what happened. He added that only meat inspectors certified by the Public Health department are allowed to inspect meat. Mwaniki cautioned residents against buying meat from uncertified sellers. This is the only way they can avoid risking their lives, he said.[Byline: Alice Waithera]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not clear what the incubation period of the illness was. If the incubation period was less than 6-18 hours, the illness might have been _Clostridium perfringes_ related although the usually diarrheal illness typically resolves within 24 hours. A longer incubation period with a more prolonged illness of 5-7 days and what seems like positive stool bacterial cultures suggests that salmonellosis might be the etiology. ProMED would appreciate more information regarding the outbreak's etiology and the number of affected individuals.Murang'a County (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muranga_County>) is one of the counties of Kenya's former Central Province.
