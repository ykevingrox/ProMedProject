Plateau state officially reported 31 cases of Lassa fever with 7 deaths as of 25 Aug 2017. Occurrence of another case in this state is not surprising. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at <https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2237/2044987545_0e36ef42d7_b.jpg>Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3950>. - Mod.TY]
