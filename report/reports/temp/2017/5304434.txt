This follows 21 reported cases of a measles outbreak in the Actonville area near Benoni between July and August [2017].Ekurhuleni is rolling out an emergency measles vaccination campaign in all its primary care health facilities. As part of the campaign, children under the age of 5 will be vaccinated or receive a booster dose. ""Measles is a very contagious disease that can spread through contact with infected mucus or saliva and is a serious condition that can be fatal for small children. An infected person can easily release the infection into the air when they cough or sneeze,"" Ekurhuleni spokesperson Themba Gadebe said. Parents should immediately rush their children to the nearest clinic for medical assistance should they show any signs of a high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes.[Byline: Elzaan Pienaar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED map of South Africa can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179>]******Europe---[2] UKDate: Thu 7 Sep 2017Source: Penarth Times [edited]<http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/15520779.Measles_warning_is_issued_in_health_board_area/>More than 7600 children between the ages of 5 and 16 in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine and are at risk from measles, according to Public Health Wales.The warning comes as a measles outbreak affecting the Newport and Torfaen area continues, with 17 confirmed cases of the infection.The outbreak can be directly linked to an ongoing outbreak of measles in Europe which has seen more than 14 000 cases and dozens of deaths since the beginning of the year [2017].Although there are no confirmed measles cases in Cardiff and Vale University Health Board at present, Public Health Wales is warning that while the 95 percent vaccination target has not been reached, cases and outbreaks of this potentially deadly infection could be seen anywhere in Wales.The symptoms of measles include a high temperature, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a distinctive red rash. ...Parents whose children are not up to date with 2 doses of MMR should ensure that they contact their GP practice to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine.Adults born since 1970, who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine, are also urged to ensure they contact their surgery about vaccination, especially if they work with children.The 1st dose of MMR is usually given to babies at between 12 and 13 months of age, and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age, but it is never too late to catch up on missed doses.About one in 5 children with measles can experience serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia or meningitis. One in 10 children with measles ends up in hospital and in rare cases it can be fatal.Further information is available at <publichealthwales.org/measles>.[Byline: Anthony Lewis]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Gaps in vaccination coverage against measles have led to outbreaks of the disease in Europe in the past year [2016], with both children and young adults affected. - Mod.LK][A HealthMap/ProMED map of the United Kingdom can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>]******[3] BulgariaDate: Thu 7 Sep 2017Source: Eurosurveillance 22 (36) [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22873>A Kurchatova et al. 2017. Preliminary Findings Indicate Nosocomial Transmission And Roma Population As Most Affected Group In Ongoing Measles B3 Genotype Outbreak In Bulgaria, March To August 2017. Eurosurveillance 22 (36). Rapid communicationAbstract. From March to August 2017, 165 measles cases were reported from 3 regions in Bulgaria. The age range was 0-55 years and 66 percent of the cases were under 9 years. The Roma population was disproportionally affected (89 percent of cases), 41 percent cases were unvaccinated and in 24 cases there was nosocomial transmission mostly in paediatric departments. A child under 12 months of age died. Control measures have been taken and the investigation is still ongoing.Discussion. Following the occurrence of the index case in March 2017, 3 clusters of measles cases were registered in Bulgaria. Roma population living in 2 neighbouring regions in Plovdiv and Pazardjik was the most affected group.According to the latest national census in Bulgaria in 2011 [7], the population consists of Bulgarians (84.8 percent), Turks (8.8 percent) and Roma (4.9 percent). Roma inhabit all regions of the country. They live in overcrowded communities often under poor sanitary conditions and they are characterised by frequent travel within the country and abroad [8].Up to 2 main features of the ongoing outbreak can be outlined: (i) the existence of a vulnerable group of Roma population non-immunised or insufficiently immunised and (ii) nosocomial measles transmission in the paediatric departments of 2 hospitals in Plovdiv. The recommendation to hospitalise vulnerable Roma children, may also have contributed to the latter. ...-more--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>
