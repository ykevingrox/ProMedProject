Patch.com [edited]<https://patch.com/washington/seattle/flesh-eating-bacteria-found-fish-seattle-store>A local man has been sickened by a rare form of flesh-eating bacteria linked to fish from grocery store tanks. This is the 2nd such case in the area recently; a woman was sickened by _Vibrio vulnificus_ in November 2016 after cutting her hand while preparing tilapia purchased at a Bellevue seafood store. The woman sickened in the Bellevue case eventually recovered.In this most recent case, King County health officials say the man, who is in his 40s, cut his hand while preparing the fish. He bought the fish at the Seattle Supermarket on Beacon Hill. The store has discarded all its fish and cleaned out fish tanks. Health investigators are working to find the source of the contaminated product. Still, the ""flesh-eating version"" of vibrio is rare. The CDC tracked about 900 infections in the USA between 1998 and 2006.[Byline: Neal McNamara]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Tilapia is a tropical water fish, so it was not likely harvested in the Washington State area. It is not entirely clear what fish was linked to the more current case. - Mod.LL]******[2] AlabamaDate: Sat 15 Jul 2017Source: Fox10 [edited]<http://www.fox10tv.com/story/35894477/teen-in-hospital-for-flesh-eating-bacteria-possibly-mobiles-5th-vibrio-case>There is another possible case of _Vibrio vulnificus_ on the Gulf Coast. A local teen is in the hospital battling a flesh-eating bacterium on his hand. So far in 2017, there have been 4 confirmed cases in Mobile County, 2 from the waters near Dauphin Island and the others from consuming raw oysters.It's too soon to know for sure whether this teen's case is actually _Vibrio vulnificus_, but both he and his mom tell FOX10 News that all the red flags are there. ""I don't want to be in here, but I have to,"" said the 16-year-old in a phone video chat from his hospital bed at USA Children's and Women's. He has been up all night taking anti-bacterials every few hours for 2 lesions on his hand.""They started him on the IV anti-bacterials right away. They did lots of blood work,"" said the teen's mother. ""They said it takes a week or so to get an actual positive test back, but they are treating it as though it is a flesh-eating bacteria."" The teenager says it started with a small cut on his finger from football practice, a cut that was almost healed until he went swimming off Dauphin Island on Fri 14 Jul 2017. He said his skin surrounding the cut started blistering. ""It was getting better, but when I jumped in the water, it ended up getting worse,"" he said.Health experts say exposing an open wound to salty/brackish water increases the chances of contracting _Vibrio vulnificus_, a ""flesh-eating"" bacterium that lives in the warm Gulf water. If not treated fast enough, the bacteria can have devastating effects. After hearing about the at least 4 other cases in Mobile County, the boy's parents weren't taking any chances. They rushed him to the ER at Mobile Infirmary. ""They [the doctors] are looking for signs of healing and no more spreading,"" said the mother.A spokesperson with the Mobile County Health Department also couldn't confirm yet whether this case is due to _V. vulnificus_, but he says the department will start looking into it.[Byline: Devan Coffaro]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>
