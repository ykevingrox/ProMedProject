Times Union [edited]<http://www.timesunion.com/allwcm/article/Health-department-warns-of-measles-11228616.php>The [New York] State Department of Health said [Sun 18 Jun 2017] that a healthcare worker from the Queensbury-based Hudson Headwaters Health Network is infected with measles, putting others at risk of being infected.Just days after a mumps warning was issued for the Capital Region, the department warned residents of Saratoga and Warren counties about the whereabouts of the health worker from [5-8 Jun 2017], when he could have potentially exposed others to the disease.Anyone who visited the locations listed [at the source URL above] may have been exposed.The highly contagious respiratory disease is spread by direct contact with nasal and throat secretions of the infected persons. Symptoms include a runny nose, cough, and slight fever. Eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light while the fever gradually rises each day, often peaking as high as 103-105 deg F [39.5-40.5 deg C]. Small bluish white spots surrounded by a reddish area may also appear on the inside of the mouth. After a few days, the red blotchy rash breaks out on the skin. The rash usually begins on the face and spreads downward and outward, reaching the hands and feet. The rash fades in the same order it appears.A person can spread measles from 4 days before the onset of a rash.While considered a childhood illness, it can be contacted at any age, health department officials said.Those born before 1 Jan 1957 and received 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine or have lab tests confirming immunity are unlikely to become ill with the disease. The Saratoga County and Warren County Health Departments have alerted area health care providers of the measles exposures and are working with the Hudson Headwaters to identify and contact individuals who may have been exposed to provide education and guidance. The health department will issue a regional health advisory to health care providers to notify them of the potential exposure. Health care providers should report all suspected cases of measles to their county health department. The best way to avoid measles, health officials said, is be vaccinated.[Byline: Wendy Liberator]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of New York can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234>.

This is 6 times the number of cases reported during the same period in 2016 (47).Measles has circulated widely in the general population in metropolitan France this year [2017], with 40 percent of the departments in France reporting at least 1 case.Outbreaks have been reported in Lorraine, New Aquitaine, and Occitanie.Now the health minister wants to make 11 vaccines compulsory, according to a The Local report. New health minister Agnes Buzyn said she wants to extend the number of mandatory vaccinations to 11 to include immunizations against conditions such as measles, hepatitis B, meningitis C, rubella, mumps, and whooping cough.Currently, only diphtheria, tetanus, and polio are mandatory in France.This follows Italy's new decree to make 12 vaccines compulsory for schoolchildren.According to health officials, from 1 Jan 2008-31 Dec 2016, in 9 years, more than 24 000 measles cases were reported in France (nearly 15 000 cases in the year 2011 alone). Nearly 1500 cases had severe pneumonia, 34 neurological complications (31 encephalitis, 1 myelitis, 2 Guillain-Barre), and 10 died.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of France can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France#Administrative_divisions> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] ItalyDate: Thu 15 Jun 2017Source: West [edited]<http://www.west-info.eu/measles-cases-on-the-decrease-but-the-data-are-still-worrisome/>In Italy, from the beginning of the current year [2017], measles cases have been nearly 3000.

Anyway, the data still remain worrisome. The average age was to 27 years, but almost 180 patients (6 percent) were younger than 1 year; 89 percent of the cases involved individuals who had not been vaccinated and 6 percent vaccinated but just 1 dose. 35 percent reported one or more complications, including diarrhea, stomatitis, keratoconjunctivitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and respiratory insufficiency.[Byline: Roberta Lunghini]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[89 percent of the cases not being vaccinated should be ample warning to parents to vaccinate their children!Maps of Italy can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_admin_06.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75> - Mod.LK]******[4] UK (South Wales)Date: Wed 21 Jun 2017Source: South Wales Argus [edited]<http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/gwentnews/15360603.GPs____extra_vaccine_sessions/>GP practices in the Newport area [South Wales] are setting up extra vaccination sessions for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine, following an outbreak of measles at a city school.There have been 5 confirmed cases of the virus among pupils at Lliswerry High School, and vaccination sessions there and at 6 primary schools in the immediate area have resulted in almost 300 children receiving MMR.The vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunisation programme offered in the UK, but not all children are fully protected.""We are pleased that GPs are putting in place extra vaccination sessions to ensure that as many people as possible are protected from measles,"" said Heather Lewis, consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales. ""Measles is highly infectious and the only way to prevent large outbreaks is through vaccination.""Public Health Wales continues to urge parents to ensure their children have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine to protect them against measles and its complications.""The 1st dose of MMR is usually given to babies at between 12 and 13 months of age, and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age.
