A bacterial or viral infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes the swelling. However, injuries, cancer, certain drugs, and other types of infections can also cause meningitis, according to information posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Meningitis symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck, but there are also other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia (increased sensitivity to light), and altered mental status (confusion).[Byline: Irina Marica]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report above says that one teenage boy has died of bacterial meningitis and 18 of his friends were hospitalized with suspected meningitis; this diagnosis was subsequently confirmed in one. However, the bacterial species that caused the disease is not specified.Acute bacterial meningitis is a rapidly progressive disease. In a patient with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures will indicate the causative organism and its antibiotic susceptibilities. An empiric intravenous antibiotic regimen that has a spectrum broad enough to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens is started as quickly as possible until the specific bacterial etiology is known. It is vital to begin treatment as early as possible in the course of the disease, as delay may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Adjunctive dexamethasone is also given before or with the 1st antibiotic dose. Once a pathogen is known, the antibiotic regimen can be tailored to the antibiotic susceptibilities of the pathogen.Common causes of bacterial meningitis vary by age group. Outbreaks of meningitis in the community are often due to _Neisseria meningitidis_. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.Brasov is a city with a population of 253 200 residents in Romania and the administrative centre of Brasov County (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braéªov>).
