The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-some-children-with-fever-progress-to-aes-says-doctor/article19499880.ece>Based on a study carried out in 2015, a team led by Dr Manoj V Murhekar, Director of the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology, found scrub typhus to be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in 63 percent of patients admitted to the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur [Uttar Pradesh state, UP].The study was repeated last year [2016] by the same team by comparing children with AES and healthy children who are siblings of the patients or living in the same village.It found that AES patients had 35 times greater possibility of having antibodies against scrub typhus compared with healthy children thereby confirming that AES was caused by scrub typhus.Excerpts from an interview with Dr Manoj Murhekar:- Have you carried out any studies this year [2017] on children admitted to BRD hospital with AES? How likely is scrub typhus to have caused AES this year as well?The causation of the disease or etiology will not change from year to year. In 2015 and 2016 we have seen that scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes less than 10 percent of AES in children below 15 years. Scrub typhus was responsible for over 60 percent of AES even in 2014. There is vaccination for JE virus but no intervention has been implemented widely for scrub typhus. So the etiology wouldn't have changed compared with last year.- Besides BRD hospital, is there any other referral hospital in that region? What is the extent of population that BRD hospital caters to?Except BRD hospital, there is no referral hospital in the Gorakhpur Division in Uttar Pradesh. The hospital caters to people living in Gorakhpur Division (4 districts) and Basti division in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and even Nepal.- Why do we see a large number of children with AES each year at BRD hospital?There is a lot of scrub typhus fever in the community. Between 20-25 percent of fever in children being attended to at PHCs [primary health centres] is caused by scrub typhus. Only a small percentage of these children progress to AES. Most of the cases in the community are sub-clinical with no symptoms or very mild fever. Only some children with fever will progress to AES. The hospital sees 1500-2000 cases each year and 80 percent of these cases are during July to October.About 1/4 of patients with AES are adults. Generally, adults develop immunity against scrub typhus, so only those who have not been exposed to scrub typhus will progress to AES.- Is there any specific reason why scrub typhus is found only in this region?It is not correct to say it is restricted only to this region. Scrub typhus is found even in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu it is found in Vellore and Thiruvallur districts. About 7-10 percent of fever in these 2 districts is caused by scrub typhus. The reason why it is found only in these 2 districts in Tamil Nadu is because researchers have investigated for scrub typhus in these 2 districts.- Is it possible to treat scrub typhus and prevent the infection from progressing to AES?In the beginning of this year [2017], the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended to the Uttar Pradesh government to use doxycycline antibiotic to treat children with fever for 5 days. The ICMR shared an algorithm with the Uttar Pradesh government which tells which fever should be treated with doxycycline and the dosage. If treated early with doxycycline, then children will not progress to AES. This prevention strategy has to be implemented widely and even by doctors in the private sector before we see results. In July [2017], ICMR and doctors from the Christian Medical College, Vellore went to Gorakhpur and conducted awareness campaign for Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Association of Paediatrics (IAP) doctors, chief medical officers, and programme officers.- Why is the death rate high at 20 percent in children with AES?At BRD hospital, we have observed patients with AES. The mortality is about 20 percent due to multi-organ involvement. In the case of AES caused by scrub typhus, the mortality is about 15-17 percent compared with AES caused by JE. This is because treatment started early with azithromycin can treat AES caused by scrub typhus. Azithromycin is in the class of medicines as doxycycline but easy to administer in sick children as it is given intravenously.- What is vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis and why don't we see herd immunity with this vaccine?In 2012, the vaccine coverage for Japanese encephalitis was only 50 percent but has improved to 75 percent now. A study we carried out in 2015 found 75 percent coverage for the 1st dose and only 42 percent for the 2nd dose. 3 of the 4 children aged 25-36 months in Gorakhpur region had received at least one dose of the vaccine. We need 2 doses of the vaccine -- during 9-12 months for the 1st dose and 16-24 months for the 2nd dose -- for optimal protection. With just one dose, the efficacy is over 80 percent. No studies have been done to find the duration of protection. With increasing vaccine coverage the incidence of JE has dropped from about 20 percent a few years ago to less than 10 percent now.In the case of mosquito-borne diseases, herd immunity will not play a major role. So increasing the vaccine coverage should be a priority.[Byline: R Prasad]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and other states in northeastern India, as noted in the report above, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The report above implicates scrub typhus as a major cause of AES. It is not clear why most of the AES cases are in children, but scrub typhus infections occur in people of all ages.Scrub typhus in India has been receiving additional attention in recent years. a 2013 review article indicated that scrub typhus is seriously neglected and under-reported (<http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.13-0064>). ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546.The report above indicates that JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year (2017) but have not provided complete coverage. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report is another implicating scrub typhus as an important etiology of the AES cases. However, getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing. Prospective studies are required to confirm the degree of scrub typhus involvement in AES cases.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>.

The HealthMap/ProMED map of Uttar Pradesh state, India can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/322>. - Mod.TY][A recent report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases (1), which ProMED-mail posted (2), indicated that the scrub typhus may account for a significant proportion of acute encephalitis syndrome in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states, especially since 2011 (3), so that it is not surprising that scrub typhus could account for many cases of acute encephalitis in other Indian states (4). However, I noted at the time in the moderator comments (2) that although headache is a common part of the symptom complex of scrub typhus, acute encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, with a history of altered sensorium, seizures or neck stiffness, and abnormal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings, complicates a minority of scrub typhus cases (5-7).
