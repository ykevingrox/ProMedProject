The observer Review & Express [edited]<http://www.observer-review.com/rare-tick-virus-is-now-in-state-cms-5800>The Schuyler county Public Health office wants the public to know there are 3 recent cases of Powassan virus [infection] identified in Saratoga county, New York. Infected ticks transmit the Powassan (POW) virus to people. Many POW infected people do not develop any symptoms; but those who do develop symptoms, often include fever, headache, loss of coordination, and seizures. The POW virus [infection] can lead to more severe symptoms including swelling of the brain and spinal cord and in a few cases, death does occur.The POW virus is rare with only 26 cases seen in New York from 2004-2016. ""There has never been a documented case of Powassan virus in Schuyler county or any of the western region of NYS [New York state], but we remain alert to its presence in the state and are working with local health care providers to monitor our community,"" said Schuyler county Public Health Director, Marcia Kasprzyk.Prevention is key. The best protection from POW virus and all tick related diseases, like Lyme, is to eliminate your exposure to ticks. Protection includes applying a DEET repellant before spending time outdoors, wearing long-sleeved, light colored, breathable clothing and tucking your pants into your socks, and staying on trails to avoid brush and leaves. When you come in from outdoors it is important to shower and check for ticks on your body and clothing.The Powassan virus is primarily seen in the northeastern part of the United States. New York, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have seen the highest number of cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The 18 Jul 2017 post on POW virus infection in the upper Hudson Valley, New York reported 2 cases (see Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (07): USA (NY) 20170721.5193574).
