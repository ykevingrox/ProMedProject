Though pigs and wild birds are the primary carriers of the JE virus, it is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.Recently, the doctors at D Y Patil hospital in Pimpri had sent the blood sample of a 49-year-old woman to National Institute of Virology (NIV) for tests, and the sample tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. The patient is a resident of village Bhose (Khed taluka), in Pune district.This is the 4th JE case recorded in Pune in the last 11 months. On [16 Jun 2017], a 10-month-old child from Kondhwa had tested positive for JE. Prior to that, 2 students in Pune had tested positive for JE in November and December last year [2016].""The woman suffered from fever and convulsions. She was admitted to D Y Patil Medical College and hospital on [4 Sep 2017]. Her blood sample tested positive for JE antibodies (IgM) at NIV on [20 Sep 2017]. She is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU),"" said district malaria officer Suresh Dhekle. The woman belongs to the family of ironsmiths. ""She has 3 children and a husband. All other family members are healthy. We have carried out fever surveillance in the village and have not found any other fever patient,"" Dhekle added.State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, ""This is the 2nd case in Pune this year [2017] and 4th since November 2016. We have stepped up surveillance in and around the patient's home.""Experts said the spread of the disease was a cause for concern as it indicates that the virus was circulating in a wider geographical area. In the past, JE cases were mainly reported from the state's eastern districts, including Chandrapur, Gondia, Bhandara, Nagpur and Gadchiroli.[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[JE cases are relatively uncommon in this area. There were 2 JE cases confirmed in Pune in December 2016 (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (39): (MA) 20161223.4720235). Avoidance of mosquito bites as is usually recommended is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The virus is endemic in north western India with birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>. - Mod.TY]
