Al Jazeera [in Arabic, mach. trans., edited]<http://tinyurl.com/m7vnlym>A medical source told Al Jazeera that there have been 15 registered cases of suspected polio in the rural area of Deir al Zour in eastern Syria, with diagnoses made clinically by specialist physicians in the province. This area is controlled by the [so-called] Islamic State. The cases were clinically diagnosed, not laboratory confirmed.The medical sources added that the polio vaccination campaigns have stalled since July last year [2016], and the rural area of Deir al Zour is witnessing medical conditions that have been deteriorating due to the primitive oil refining operations.The World Health Organization issued a report in 2013, saying it recorded dozens of polio cases in Deir ez-Zor. [see comment below].Polio is a contagious viral disease that can affect the patient's nerves and lead to paralysis or death and is caused by infection with the polio virus. [In areas with insufficient vaccination coverages, children tend to be the primary age group affected by the poliovirus.]Polio virus is highly contagious and spreads from person to person in several ways including direct contact between an infected person to another, through mucus and phlegm from the mouth and nose, and through contaminated feces, plus food and water polluters. The virus enters the body through the mouth or nose, then multiplies in the throat and intestinal tract, and then is absorbed into the body and travels through the blood to the rest of the body and nervous system.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As mentioned in the media report above, in 2013, there was an outbreak of polio caused by WPV1 in Syria with a total of 37 cases reported, 25 cases reported by the Syrian Arab Republic Ministry of Health, and 12 cases from conflict/contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour). (See <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_3_21polio/en/>). The above report of 15 suspected cases is very disturbing as it is in a conflict zone with difficult access which, if true, has not had polio vaccination activities for at least one year now. If these cases are confirmed as due to WPV, the genetic studies will be critical to understand the movement of the virus into Syria. Is the virus related to one that was last identified in Syria in 2013 that has been circulating under the radarscope for 3.5 years, or is it related to viruses currently circulating in Pakistan, Afghanistan or possibly Nigeria? We await further information on this report.More information on this report of suspected cases of paralytic polio in Syria would be greatly appreciated.Deir Al Zour is the largest city in eastern Syria. It is located 450 km (280 mi) to the north east of the capital Damascus, on the shores of the Euphrates River. According to a January 2017 New York Times report, ""Since early 2015, the jihadists have besieged the provincial capital, also called Deir al-Zour, where about 200 000 people live. The [so-called] Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, controls roughly half of the city, while the rest is held by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria."" <https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/politics/us-syria-isis.html?_r=0>A map of Syria showing provinces can be found at <http://www.emapsworld.com/images/syria-provinces-map.gif>.
