The Himalayan Times [edited]<https://thehimalayantimes.com/health/emerging-cutaneous-leishmaniasis-2/>[DL], 32, had gone to Dolpa [Province Six] in 2016. After staying there for about 3-4 months he was back in Kathmandu on [11 Oct 2016]. Upon his return, he noticed blisters on his nose and cheeks. Dismissing it as pimple, he bought a pimple cream from a local pharmacy in Bhaktapur but the cream didn't work. Rather the size of the blisters increased. In an attempt to treat it, he squeezed making them more reddish, and the shape changed too. So, he visited a hospital in the Capital [Kathmandu] where he was given medicines for tuberculosis. But that medicine worsened the infection. Later he was referred to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Teku [Kathmandu] and its Consultant Tropical Medicine Physician Dr Anup Bastola diagnosed it as 'cutaneous leishmaniasis'.""It was quite an unusual skin infection. After some tests it was discovered that he was suffering from cutaneous leishmaniasis,"" the doctor informed. ""Leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoan leishmania parasites. They are transmitted by the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sand flies. And among the 3 main forms of leishmaniasis, [DL] was diagnosed with the most common one -- cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL. There are about 20 species of _Leishmania_ that may cause cutaneous leishmaniasis.""As per Dr Bastola, this is an emerging disease in the country. He informed, ""The cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been seen in areas like Dharan [Province One], Makwanpur and Dhading [Province Three], Tanahun [Province Four], Nepalgunj [Province Five], and Dolpa [Province Six] in the country. From 2016 till February 2017, 4 such cases have been identified in the Teku-based hospital. In addition, 8 cases have also been reported from the far western development region while 2 cases from Dharan.""As an emerging disease, they are still researching about the species of _Leishmania_ that is infecting people here.The infection is transmitted by infected phlebotomine sand flies. ""Sand flies become infected by sucking blood from an infected animal or person. As the parasites are found in rodents, these sand flies feed on them and when they bite a healthy person, they transmit the infection,"" Dr Bastola shared. Nepal has a favourable climate for its survival, the sand flies are found here too, which puts people at risk. ""When someone is infected with leishmaniasis, a red lesion starts as a papule or nodule at the site where the sand fly has bit. It grows slowly and increases in size. In the early stage it seems to be like a pimple,"" clarified Dr Bastola.He added, ""A crust develops centrally. The patient feels mild itching in the infected area, red juicy plaque-like crusting too are likely to appear. However, at times it can be asymptomatic and can be destructive too. It depends upon the species of leishmania you are infected with.""With the medicines and diagnostic tools currently available in the country, adequate control of leishmaniasis is possible, Dr Bastola said. However, he insisted that dermatologists must be aware about the infection in advance so that they can diagnose the disease in its early stages.For others, the doctor advised to ""keep surroundings clean, try not to come out in the evenings unless necessary, wear full sleeved clothes, not to forget to use mosquito repellents to be safe from the bites of sand flies"".--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Nepal. Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in a few provinces in Southern Nepal bordering India, with one district reporting 5-10 cases per 10 000 population and the rest 1-5 or less than one (see map and graphs with annual reported number of cases at <http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/NEPAL.pdf>), and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is very rare (see archive no. 20161002.4531103).The _Leishmania_ from a previous case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Nepal was typed as _L. major_. Cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Western Himalayas is known to be caused by. _L. major_ and _L. donovani_ (Katakura K: Molecular epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Asia (focus on cutaneous infections). Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2009; 22(2): 126-30; abstract available at <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19276879>).Cutaneous leishmaniasis is common in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but was until recently considered rare in Indian Kashmir. However, a study from 2015 reported a new focus of CL in the Kashmir Valley (Wani GM et al: Clinical study of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Kashmir Valley. Indian Dermatol Online J. 2015; 6(6): 387-92); available at <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4693348/>.The present report of many cases of CL in the Kathmandu valley indicates that CL has spread further from Kashmir into Nepal. - Mod.EPMaps of Nepal can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_Federal_States> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2877>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
