Norovirus infections cause diarrhea in some of those who are exposed and vomiting in others and are asymptomatic in about one 3rd of [infected individuals]. After an incubation period of 10 to 51 hours, the disease often begins with vomiting, followed by abdominal cramps, fever (in 37 to 45 per cent of cases), watery diarrhea, and other constitutional symptoms such as headache, chills, and myalgias. The illness normally lasts only 2-3 days but can last longer (4-6 days) in nosocomial outbreaks and among children under 11 years of age. Virus can be shed in low titers for up to 8 weeks in previously healthy persons and for more than a year in patients who are immunocompromised. Fatalities have been reported in association with outbreaks of gastroenteritis among elderly people in nursing home facilities and, in the United Kingdom, an estimated 80 deaths from norovirus infections occur each year among people over 64 years of age. Recent reports have suggested possible associations of norovirus infection with necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns, with benign seizures in infants, and with exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease in pediatric patients; further study is needed to confirm these links.[excerpted and edited from: RI Glass, UD Parashar, MK Estes.

The state government also said it would investigate and count the number of grave sites of those affected to determine the actual number of people who died as a result of the mysterious disease suspected to be gastroenteritis and malaria.For details please visit <https://www.today.ng/news/nigeria/6166/mysterious-deaths-caused-lassa-fever-kogi-govt>.Whatever is finally resolved that the outbreak is, 2 related questions need be addressed:1. Why is the Fulani/Fulani settlement appear to be a risk factor?2. Is outbreak notification more among the Fulani or are they more susceptible?--communicated by:Olutayo Olajide Babalobi[details above]<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>******[3] Yagba West LGA in neighboring Kogi StateI just read that a similar (if not the same) human disease incident is occurring in the adjoining Yagba West LGA in neighboring Kogi State (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagba_West>). It is also instructive that the Fulani are worst hit. However, Lassa fever has been ruled out after sample test (<http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/just-strange-disease-kills-50-people-kogi/>).Extract:A strange disease whose symptoms include diarrhea, bloodstained vomiting and high fever has killed 50 people at Okunran, Okoloke and Isanlu-Esa villages in Yagba West Local Government of Kogi State. Initial reports had suspected Lassa fever, but medics told Dr Saka Audu, commissioner for health, who visited the affected areas on Thursday [August 2017], that it was a strange disease that was unknown. ""We initially suspected lassa Fever after getting some misleading reports about people bleeding around, so we made a diagnosis for viral haemorrhagic fever (lassa fever), but the result was negative,"" Dr Jannette Hathorn, a consultant at ECWA Hospital, Egbe told Audu.She said the 1st case was that of a child of 2 1/2 years, who died 12 hours after he was brought to the hospital. ""We are sure it is not Lassa fever; but our concern is that we do not know exactly what is happening. We have not arrived at a definitive diagnosis. ""Two adult patients were also brought here; one showed symptoms of ulcer-viral illness, but there was no bleeding component of any haemorrhagic symptom. ""We isolated them and both of them were treated for malaria. When they started improving, we let them go.""Another parent brought a child to the hospital and pleaded for help. He said that 50 people had died in their village with similar symptoms of bloodstained vomiting, diarrhea and fever. ""When the child died, we called the World Health Organisation (WHO). Yesterday [Wed 16 Aug 2017], their officials came and took samples of everything; we must know exactly what we are dealing with,"" she said.Audu, who described the situation as ""serious"", said the visit was to assess it ""especially since many lives have been lost to the disease"". ""We want to determine the cause of these mysterious deaths and then proffer solution to it. ""Government is committed to assisting the people irrespective of how remote their settlements may be. We must ensure that we take healthcare to the door steps of rural dwellers. ""We want to reassure the people that government is with them and will take full responsibility of those who are already ill, so as to arrest the spread of this disease. ""For now, what is clear and confirmed is that it is not lassa fever; but whatever it is, we will carry out further investigation and come up with definitive diagnosis,"" Audu said.He said that the information about the outbreak of the strange disease came to government last week [week of Sun 6 Aug 2017] and a technical team was immediately sent to take samples which were sent to General Hospital Irrua, Edo State, for definitive investigation. ""We are digging into the real cause of this ailment. All hands are on deck toward unraveling the definitive cause of the mysterious deaths among the kids,"" the commissioner assured.According to him, the Fulani settlers have been reported to be the worst hit by the disease which broke out 3 weeks ago. Ardo Damina Ibrahim, leader of the Fulani settlement, told newsmen that the 1st case was reported 3 weeks ago, adding that children were worst hit. ""We at first used herbs to treat the patients but had to rush to the hospital after recording several deaths,"" he said. He explained that parents became more confused when doctors could not ascertain the cause of the illness, saying that many died in the hospital while others were discharged without any cure. ""We have lost more than 50 people and still have many helpless patients at home,'' he said.Oba Joshua Ogunyanda, the traditional ruler of the community, who thanked the commissioner for visiting the area in spite of the difficult terrain, said that he ran to the Yagba Local Government when the disease broke out. ""We are confident that the disease will soon be brought under control with the commitment that you have shown,"" he said. The commissioner later gave N50 000 [USD 138] to the leader of the Fulani community to transport the sick patients to Lokoja for proper treatment (<http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/just-strange-disease-kills-50-people-kogi/>).(Yagba West is a Local Government Area in Kogi State, Nigeria, in the west of the state adjoining Kwara State. Its headquarters are in the town of Odo Ere. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagba_West>)--communicated by:Olutayo Olajide Babalobi[details above]<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>******[4] Deaths and symptoms One respondent reported 2nd hand that the date of onset of the outbreak was [Sun 23 July2017] and since then approximately 120 people have died around the Oro-Ago area. The infected individuals experienced intermittent headaches and severe stomach pain. Approximately 1-1.5 hours after onset, they started vomiting blood. Those who were unable to vomit blood died within 6 hours. But those who vomited blood survived for about 3 days before dying.--communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] Food poisoning The outbreak is likely to be poisoning due to a longstanding feud between local crop farmers and settled pastoralist/itinerant nomadic pastoralist. I learnt that the present Kwara State governor is from the affected area and the government is overwhelmed by the armed itinerant nomads who are taking over the place. That could explain why government officials are denying what seems obvious -- a sporadic and deliberate food poisoning targeted at the Fulani 'nuisance' likely by the indigenous Yorubas that is becoming recurrent/endemic.I am still expecting feedbacks from both Kwara State based Fulani contact and also from Kwara state based resident veterinarians.--communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[The cause of this situation remains unclear.
