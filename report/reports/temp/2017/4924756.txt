Romanian Insider [edited]<http://www.romania-insider.com/measles-outbreak-romania-3400-cases-registered-37-counties-17-children-dead/>The ongoing measles outbreak in Romania has infected 3446 people by 10 March this year [2017], killing 17 children, according to data from the National Institute of Public Health, cited by local Agerpres.Up to 5 of the 17 children killed by this disease were from Arad county, 4 were from Timis county, 6 were from Dolj and Caras Severin counties, 1 from Satu Mare county, and 1 from Bucharest. Measles cases were registered in 37 of Romania's 41 counties.In Dolj county, 175 cases of measles have been registered since the outbreak started in June 2016. Moreover, the disease has killed 3 un-vaccinated children there. However, on the good side, the number of measles cases is on a downward trend, according to doctor Stefan Popescu, spokesman for the Public Health Department (DSP) Dolj.Meanwhile, more than 530 cases of measles were confirmed in Timis county, with 4 children being killed by the disease since the outbreak started. In Brasov, there were 43 confirmed cases from 1 January 2016 to 17 February 2017, and no death.Measles cases were also reported in counties such as Satu Mare, Alba, Suceava, Sibiu, Hunedoara, and Vaslui. The local authorities are currently conducting a vaccination campaign for children aged between 9 months and 9 years.The measles outbreak in Romania is mainly the result of the anti-vaccination campaign that has drawn a lot of supporters among Romanian parents in recent years. Those who oppose vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella claim that the vaccine has serious side effects, and can even cause autism.Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on the World Health Organization's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.[Byline: Irina Popescu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Also see Measles update (11) report [4] on Romanian outbreak 20170309.4888914Maps of Romania can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Canada (Nova Scotia) alertDate: Mon 20 Mar 2017 2:49 PMSource: Local Xpress [edited]<https://www.localxpress.ca/local-news/travel-related-case-of-measles-identified-in-nova-scotia-566141>Nova Scotia Health officials are trying to track down people who may have been exposed to the measles virus from [Fri 10 Mar - Wed 15 Mar 2017].

The total number of reported cases of measles in NSW has ranged between 9 and 174.""Due to high immunization rates and effective public health action the disease has been eliminated from Australia with limited onward spread from cases occurring in connection with importations,"" Dr Vicky Sheppeard, director of communicable diseases for NSW Health said earlier this month [March 2017].The disease is no longer seasonal in Australia, NSW Health said.Dr Bag said the latest cases yet again reinforced the importance of getting vaccinated to protect against the disease.

This is the 1st measles death in Switzerland since 2009 when a 12-year-old girl died in Geneva.The FOPH did not want to go into the details, but said that the patient also had leukaemia. He eventually died of lung failure and his immune system had been seriously weakened by the treatment he was receiving, which meant the measles vaccination he received was less effective.""We don't know where he caught the illness"" said Daniel Koch, alluding to the importance of eradicating the disease in Switzerland.In 2016, 70 cases were recorded. In 2015, the number was 36, and in 2014, it was even lower at 22. Several Swiss cantons have seen the disease spread said the FOPH at the beginning of February [2017]. Cases have been reported in Ticino, Graubunden, Fribourg, Solothurn, St. Gallen and Zurich. Several cases were reported over the school holidays. The risk of spread increases when people are mobile.Despite rising rates of measles, rates of vaccination are increasing in Switzerland. Data from 8 cantons show that in 2014 on average 93 percent of 2-year-olds had received the measles vaccine, and 83 percent had received 2 doses.Daniel Koch told the Tages-Anzeiger that the number of vaccinated young adults rose from 10 percent to 87 percent between 2012 and 2015, something he is very pleased about.[Byline: Shannon Fagan]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105>. - Mod.LK]******[6] Vaccine exemption policyDate: Tue 21 Mar 2017Source: Eureka Alert [edited]<https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/uoca-scl032117.php>States with weaker non-medical exemption policies for vaccinations can reduce the likelihood of a measles outbreak 140 -- 190 percent by strengthening them, a new study from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus shows.Researchers said the magnitude of those outbreaks can also be cut in half by strengthening exemption policies for children.""In the year 2000 measles was no longer being transmitted in the U.S.,"" said the study's lead author Melanie Whittington, PhD, a health services researcher. ""Compare that to 2015 when we had over 150 cases in the 1st 3 months. Suddenly measles is an issue again despite having an effective vaccine.""Whittington and her colleagues, including the study's senior author Jonathan Campbell, PhD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the CU Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, wanted to find out why.Using mathematical models, they simulated the magnitude, likelihood and cost of a measles outbreak under different non-medical vaccine exemption policies.Every state has such policies. Those with ""easy"" exemption policies typically only require a parent signature on a standardized form. States with ""medium"" exemption policies require parents to obtain a form from a health department and/or attend an educational session on vaccinations, or write a statement of objection. Finally, states with ""difficult"" exemption policies require parents to get a standardized form or statement of objection notarized.The researchers, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Immunization Study, found easier non-medical vaccine exemption policies to be associated with a greater risk for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.The state they modeled was Colorado, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates for measles. Only 87.4 percent of children between the ages of 19--35 months are covered. And 5 percent of kindergartners report an exemption.""We modeled an environment where the population had low vaccination coverage and then simulated measles outbreaks under different exemption policies,"" said Whittington. ""We found that a state like Colorado is 140 -- 190 percent more likely to experience an outbreak with an easy exemption policy than if it had a medium or difficult non-medical exemption policy. The outbreak size can also be reduced nearly by half with stronger policies.""While the researchers focused on measles, strengthening exemption policies could benefit other vaccine-preventable diseases, such as mumps.""There is a tradeoff here,"" said Campbell, who specializes in pharmaceutical outcomes research. ""It's a trade between freedom and risk. Are we willing to give up a small piece of freedom that nudges us toward vaccination in order to halve the risk of a detrimental outbreak of a preventable disease? I think Colorado should be willing to make that trade.""The researchers urged the strengthening of non-medical exemption policies as a way to increase vaccination coverage.""We are not saying you can't have non-medical exemptions,"" Campbell and Whittington said. ""But if we strengthen them, we can improve health and reduce the economic impact of a potential outbreak.""Citation. MD Whittington, A Kempe, A Dempsey, et al. 2017.

With vaccine preventable diseases, this conflict of interest has become all too common. Individuals may need to sacrifice a little freedom of choice to meet the needs of the greater good. The approach to decrease the size of outbreaks of measles suggested in this report, i.e., by making request for an exemption more labor-intensive, could be successful unless parents are adamantly opposed to the practice of vaccination. In that case, education is the best path to effect a change so parents understand the consequences of refusal to vaccinate. - Mod.LK]
