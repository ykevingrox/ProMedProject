She was bleeding from the gums, nostril and vagina and was confirmed Lassa Fever victim in Irua.""The moment it was confirmed that she had Lassa fever, we started contacts tracing. As of now, we have about 65 we are following up, 2 of them have developed fever and their samples have been taken to Irua.

However, appearance of cases in Anambra state is not surprising. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. The circumstances under which this unfortunate nursing student was exposed to the virus are not indicated in the above report.Images of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
