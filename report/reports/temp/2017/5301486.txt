For a description of Rajhbari, go to: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajbari_District> which is in Dhaka Division at the junction of the Ganges & Jamuna rivers. It is not far from the previous outbreak in Khulna.As I have written before, telling folk to not slaughter and butcher sick cattle is as effective as a public policy of sexual abstinence. Folk hear but they don't listen. Bangladesh is overdue for a livestock anthrax control and surveillance proactive programme, especially in the provinces with repeated outbreaks. Such are cost effective and, if nothing else, it effectively prevents human cases of anthrax which are expensive when the affected end up in hospital. - Mod.MHJ]
