EIN News [edited]<http://www.einnews.com/pr_news/387694222/hepatitis-e-outbreak-in-diffa-876-suspected-cases-including-186-pregnant-women-admitted-to-hospital>In southeastern Niger, the hepatitis E outbreak declared 2 months ago is particularly affecting pregnant women. Of the 186 women admitted to the main maternal and pediatric health centre in the town of Diffa [from 2 Jan 2017 to 11 Jun 2017], 34 died of severe complications related to the disease. Of the 876 cases of hepatitis E reported by [11 Jun 2017], the majority are displaced people and refugees, 247 900 according to the authorities. As the disease spreads mainly through contaminated water, the current outbreak highlights poor water and sanitation conditions and the lack of adequate sanitation facilities among these people, already affected by the violence of the ongoing conflict between Boko Haram and the armies of the region.Instability and lack of infrastructure--------------------------------------In Diffa, where access to healthcare has been hampered in particular by insecurity, the lack of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure has an even greater impact on the health situation. Several sites within the displaced camps and communities do not have an adequate supply of drinking water, leaving some of the needs of the most vulnerable populations unmet. In addition, there is a lack of latrines, and those that are in place are in poor conditions.From the experience of other hepatitis E outbreaks in Africa, the Diffa one could last for several more months. The number of suspected cases may increase further in the near future, with the arrival of the rainy season, usually from June to September. ""Given the scarcity of water for the most vulnerable populations, the risk is that alternative sources that can spread the outbreak will be used, such as the supply from streams and other natural water points formed by accumulated rain water. These collection points are considered as potential vectors of the disease"", explains Audace Ntezukobagira, emergency coordinator for MSF in Diffa. ""It is also important to take into account that these people do not have the material or financial means to stock up on wood or gas, to boil the water in order to make it suitable for consumption.""Water, hygiene and sanitation-----------------------------To respond to the outbreak, one of the priorities is the strengthening of water and sanitation activities. However, the current response has not yet reached the standard required due to insufficient resources and coordination between humanitarian actors.At certain sites, for example, it can be seen that jerry cans which are unsuitable for transporting water are not systematically collected when they are replaced. ""This provokes a clear problem in terms of the risk of spreading the disease, as well as creating confusion as new jerry cans could be distributed several times in the same place"", says Sabiou Mansour, logistics manager for the MSF emergency team in Diffa. ""It is deplorable, considering the efforts already provided in the region and the magnitude of the needs.""Since April 2017, MSF has strengthened its capacity to deploy emergency sanitation and hygiene measures at 11 sites. The teams working on more than 130 functional water points ensured that more than 6300 cubic-meters of water was chlorinated, 127 300 jerry cans were washed, nearly 3400 old ones were replaced with new ones, and cleaning kits, including more than 36 800 soaps, were distributed.For Sani Toubomrabo, a Nigerian community leader based in Garin Wazam, ""the chlorinated water we bring home is useful to avoid getting sick, which is why we collaborate with the health agents present at the water points.""Patient treatment-----------------The response to the outbreak also includes free management of patients in health facilities at the community level and referral to hospital for those patients who develop complications.In this respect, MSF teams are supporting the health authorities with human and material resources that have been deployed to deal with the situation. In addition to medical treatment, patients with hepatitis E receive psychological support. The organization also provides technical support for health staff in the structures in which it operates in order to ensure free and high-quality care for patients. A decrease in mortality was also observed among women with severe complications related to the disease admitted to the main maternal and paediatric health centre in the town of Diffa.Awareness-raising in the heart of the community-----------------------------------------------Health promotion activities in the health facilities and the community have also been set up by MSF. To date [Tue 20 Jun 2017], nearly 32 000 people have been informed, including patients and their families. At the same time, MSF is actively looking for cases in villages, which has already led to the referral of more than 400 people to health centres.MSF in Diffa------------Since the end of 2014, MSF has been working in the Diffa region to help those fleeing violence related to the presence of the Boko Haram group and military intervention in the region. MSF provides free medical and psychological assistance in 7 health centres in the region. In addition, the organization supports the supply of drinking water supply, the construction of latrines and the distribution of essential items in several villages and places where refugees, returnees and displaced people have gathered.In addition, MSF is supporting the Ministry of Health in 2 hospitals: the Nguigmi Hospital and the main maternal and child health centre in the Diffa town. In both hospitals, MSF is working in reproductive and pediatric health units, and provides mental health support. At the hospital in Nguigmi, the team also treats children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Much of the mortality in hepatitis E occurs in woman in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.The following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N and Koren G: Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015; 6(7)1: 607-608; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501603/>.""Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).""Hepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 per cent to 25 per cent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 per cent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 per cent to 50 per cent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).""References----------6.
