TVN-Noticias [in Spanish, trans. KS, edited]<http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Ministro-confirma-casos-Candida-Auris-hongo_0_4731276868.html>Staff of the Santo Tomas Hospital confirmed today [Mon 10 Apr 2017], that 3 people have tested positive for the yeast _Candida auris_, said health minister Miguel Mayo. He clarified that these 3 people have not presented with any other afflictions or more severe complications, but are nonetheless being kept hospitalized for observation.Recommended preventive measures are being taken at the hospital, and other patients who were hospitalized in previous days and have since been sent home are being followed up. People who may have been ""colonized"" by the yeast include those who have been hospitalized for a long time or who have received long-term antibiotic treatments.Meanwhile, doctors at the hospital say they have not received any formal communication about the situation regarding the fungus and that the medical management has not given more details on the issue, said Dr Marcel Penna Franco.Infectologist Xavier SÌÁez-Llorens said that the outbreak of the yeast _Candida auris_ is dangerous because it spreads quickly in seriously ill patients, in addition to being multi-drug resistant, so there are few tools to treat it. Each year, 2 to 3 nosocomial fungus outbreaks occur in hospitals, and authorities are continuing the search to determine if the fungus is present in other patients.--communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed@promedmail.org>[_C. auris_ phenotypically resembles _Candida haemulonii_. Commercially available biochemical-based tests, including API strips and VITEK-2, used in many US laboratories to identify fungi, cannot differentiate _C. auris_ from related species. Because of these challenges, clinical laboratories have misidentified the organism as _C. haemulonii_ and _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. Many clinical laboratories do not fully identify all candida to the species level, and _C. auris_ isolates have been reported as ""other _Candida_ spp"" and many do not perform antifungal sensitivities on the isolates. Isolates of _C. auris_ have been sensitive to the echinocandin type of antifungals which are only available for intravenous administration, not orally. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46668>.]
