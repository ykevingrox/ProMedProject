Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.critica.com.pa/provincias/nuevo-caso-de-hantavirus-en-los-santos-480927>A case of fever due to [a] hantavirus [infection] has been registered in Los Santos [province], specifically in Santa Isabel in Las Tablas.The case is a 30-year-old woman who was admitted to the Joaquin Franco hospital in Las Tablas with signs of the virus [infection], and the test done was positive for the fever [virus].To date, there are 4 cases of this fever and 2 with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.[Byline: Zenaida VÌÁsquez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Los Santos province is endemic for the hantavirus that can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS is a serious disease and can develop quickly, with a case fatality rate of around 30 percent.This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infections or specify the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on these or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS.In the report above, no mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred. The croplands and food sources of the area, such as stored grain, attract the rodent host of Choclo virus. The preventive measures indicated in previous reports included elimination of sites attractive to rodents. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41718>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41725>.]
