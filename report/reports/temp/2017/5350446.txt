ECDC [edited]<https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-hepatitis-outbreak-eueea-mostly-affecting-men-who-have-sex-men>Since the last rapid risk assessment on this multi-country hepatitis A outbreak, 19 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom-England and Wales) have reported 1363 new outbreak-confirmed cases. Outbreak-confirmed cases are EU/EEA residents with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype IA and a sequence with 99.3 percent homology to one of the 3 HAV genotype IA outbreak strains (VRD_521_2016; RIVM-HAV16-090; and V16-25801) based on overlapping fragments at the VP1-2a region.As of [Wed 27 Sep 2017], the number of outbreak-confirmed cases reported in 20 EU/EEA countries since 1 Jun 2016 is 2873 (Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). For 2582 of these cases information on gender is available, with a male to female (M/F) ratio of 9.3. Information on status is available for 970 male cases, 738 of which (76 percent) were reported as MSM. No other strains were reported to be widely circulating among MSM apart from the 3 outbreak strains and their close variants, which are captured in Figure 1.The largest number of cases was reported in March 2017. However, there may be substantial reporting delays (weeks or even months) in sequencing information and the number of cases with onset in more recent months is likely to increase once more sequencing results are available, particularly from Spain and Germany.Outbreak-confirmed cases provide an underestimation of the true extent of the outbreak because sequencing information is only available for a proportion of hepatitis A cases as sampling strategies vary widely from country to country. In 2017, 467 (37 percent) of the 1258 laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A case strains in 10 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden) were sequenced. Of these 467 sequenced cases, 354 (76 percent) were infected with one of the outbreak strains.In order to better define the extent of this outbreak, we describe hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases. From January to August 2017, 19 countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK-England & Wales) reported 11 212 laboratory confirmed cases with a M/F gender ratio of 4.3. The highest M/F ratio was 4.8, reported in April 2017. Since then, the number of male cases has decreased, and along with it the male-to-female ratio, although it remains higher than 3.5 (Figure 2).The 11 212 cases reported from January to August 2017 represent a 4-fold increase compared to the average 2594 cases reported annually for the same period between 2012 and 2015. The year 2016 was excluded from the comparison as the current outbreak was already taking place at the time.Poland did not report cases in 2017 but ECDC epidemic intelligence screening identified 1426 hepatitis A cases in 2017, as of [Fri 15 Sep 2017], compared to 26 cases in 2016, representing a 55-fold increase in cases during 2017 compared to 2016.ECDC asked EU/EEA countries to report on events that could contribute to the spread of the outbreak strains in population groups at increased risk of infection or in the community. Belgium, France and Germany reported 6 foodborne clusters of 15 cases on average, associated with one of the outbreak strains in 2017. As a result of these spill-over events, a limited increase has been noted in females, children and the elderly in parallel with the large increase in male cases.Slovakia reported 13 outbreaks among minority ethnic groups (Roma people) in 2017. However, these cases could not be linked to the outbreak as sequencing information was not available. The Czech Republic and Greece were the only countries observing increases in the number of cases reported in 2017 with similar distribution of cases in males and females. Greece and Italy observed clusters of cases, possibly associated with consumption of contaminated seafood. However, sequencing information was not available to link these clusters to the outbreak strains.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al. Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at <http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract>), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications: - men who have sex with men; - people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs; - people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; - people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates; - people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and - unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010>.]
