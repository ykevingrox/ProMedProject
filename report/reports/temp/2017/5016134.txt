Colonoscopy revealed diffuse colitis and mild ileitis without ulceration. Stool cultures demonstrated abundant growth of MRSA and absent normal flora. Oral vancomycin treatment was effective and seems to be the consensus choice for therapy.[Introduction]--------------_Staphylococcus aureus_ was recognized as a cause of antibiotic-associated colitis (AAC) in the mid-20th century (1,2). _Clostridium difficile_ was later identified as the primary cause of AAC, and appreciation of _S. aureus_ as a potential etiology declined (2). Methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) has also been implicated as a cause of AAC, with most reports coming from Japan. We report a case of MRSA enterocolitis in Canada caused by a strain harboring multiple enterotoxins.[Case report]-------------Colonic biopsy [in this patient] confirmed colitis without chronicity (figure, panel E; see URL above. - Mod.SH), and ileal biopsy revealed focal active ileitis. Because MRSA colitis is rare, the strain was sent to the Laboratoire de SantÌ© Publique du QuÌ©bec for identification and further characterization (Technical Appendix [PDF - 146 KB - 3 pages]). Genetic typing was positive for nuc and mecA genes, confirming MRSA. The strain was negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, enterotoxins A, B, C, E, and H, and exfoliative toxins A and B, but it harbored genes for enterotoxins D, G, and I. The spa type was t067, corresponding to the epidemic type in Canada, CMRSA2 (also known as USA100/800, New York, sequence type 5). This strain was resistant to levofloxacin, erythromycin, and clindamycin but susceptible to all remaining antibiotics (online Technical Appendix).[Discussion]------------_S. aureus_ enterocolitis has been recognized as a cause of AAC since 1948, and MRSA colitis is a variant of this disease. Most cases were reported from Japan (1); the validity of these reports has been questioned because of insufficient effort to rule out C. difficile, but recent reviews support the existence of the syndrome (3). In North America, few cases of MRSA colitis have been identified; however, this cause of enteritis might be underreported because few physicians order stool cultures for hospitalized patients with AAC (1,4). Cases of staphylococcal enteritis might occur when dysbiosis permits _Staphylococcus_ overgrowth and toxin secretion causes bowel inflammation (1). The multiple antibiotics that had been taken by this patient presumably induced dysbiosis, MRSA overgrowth, and toxin-mediated enterocolitis. The relative contribution of the different toxins to the syndrome are unknown. Gut colonization is believed to originate from the upper respiratory tract of colonized persons (5).In previous reported cases of MRSA enterocolitis, few authors reported the presence of _Staphylococcus_ toxins, mainly enterotoxin A. Although enterotoxin A is the most common toxin in _Staphylococcus_-related food poisoning, the enterotoxin D we found is reported to be the 2nd most common, supporting its role in this patient's enterocolitis (6). Enterotoxins G and I are not as well-studied but were associated with a food poisoning outbreak in Taiwan (7). Staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I induce enterocolitis by a combination of direct enterocyte cytopathy mediated by epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor toxins (disrupting the epithelial barrier) and enterotoxin superantigen-induced mucosal T-cell activation (8).The risk factors for _S. aureus_ enterocolitis include age, hospitalization, abdominal surgery, immunosuppression, gastric acid suppression, MRSA colonization, and previous antibiotic therapy. Fluoroquinolone use seems to be particularly associated with this complication (1). MRSA enterocolitis might be an underrecognized cause of AAC because stool culture in patients hospitalized for >72 hours has been discouraged (9). MRSA enterocolitis should be considered once _C. difficile_ colitis and _Klebsiella oxytoca_ colitis have been ruled out (10). Physicians should consider stool cultures for severe or prolonged AAC, and microbiology laboratories should report _S. aureus_ overgrowth in stool. Oral vancomycin was effective in this case and seems to be the consensus choice for therapy based on previous reports.[The full article, including the case description, figure, appendix, and references, is available at the source URL.]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_Staphylococcus aureus_ can cause a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from food poisoning to enterocolitis. However, since the 1970s, the role of _S. aureus_ has been over-shadowed by the occurrence of _Clostridium difficile_ as the primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis (AAC). The above case report is a reminder that _S. aureus_, in this case methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_, can also cause in antibiotic-associated enterocolitis.Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of several genes, DNA sequencing of staphylococcal protein A gene (spa typing), carriage of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, and typing the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec gene (SCCmec) are commonly used to characterize methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) isolates. The SCCmec gene determines methicillin-resistance. MRSA are grouped by MLST into clonal complexes, which contain genetically related ST types.PFGE type USA100 are multidrug-resistant strains of MRSA that are typically associated with healthcare-acquired (HA) infections, whereas PFGE type USA300 has become the predominant PFGE type for community-acquired (CA)-MRSA in the US. Most CA-MRSA carry SCCmec types IV or V and do not encode resistance to antimicrobial drugs other than beta-lactams, whereas HA-MRSA carry larger SCCmec genes (types I, II, or III) that have additional genes encoding resistance to classes of antimicrobial drugs in addition to beta-lactams. USA100, unlike USA300 CA-MRSA do not carry the genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL).The strain involved in the above patient's enterocolitis was found to be positive for the mecA gene, confirming MRSA, and was negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, enterotoxins A, B, C, E, and H, and exfoliative toxins A and B, but it harbored genes for enterotoxins D, G, and I. The spa type was said to be t067, corresponding to the epidemic MRSA type in Canada, CMRSA2 (also known as PFGE type USA100/800, ST5).Staphylococcal enterotoxin genes are located on mobile genetic elements, and enterotoxin D is one of the serotypes most commonly associated with food poisoning. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/268>.]
