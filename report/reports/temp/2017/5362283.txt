CDC, Outbreak Advisory [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/index.html>Multistate Outbreak of Human Campylobacter Infections Linked to Pet Store Puppies--------------------------------------------------------------------------55 Cases / 12 States / 13 Hospitalizations / 0 DeathsThe Ohio Department of Health, several other states, the CDC, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of human _Campylobacter_ infections linked to puppies sold through Petland, a national pet store chain. A total of 16 more ill people with a _Campylobacter_ infection linked to the outbreak have been reported since [11 Sep 2017]. The most recent illness began on [12 Sep 2017].As of [3 Oct 2017], a total of 55 people with laboratory-confirmed infections or symptoms consistent with _Campylobacter_ infection who live in 12 states (Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) have been linked to this outbreak. As many as 14 people are Petland employees from 5 states.People with confirmed or probable Campylobacter infection linked to puppies, by state of residence, as of [3 Oct 2017] (n=55)States / Case CountFlorida / 13Kansas / 7Maryland / 1Missouri / 2N Hampshire / 1New York / 1Ohio / 22Pennsylvania / 2Tennessee / 2Utah / 1Wisconsin / 2Wyoming / 1Total / 55[The epi curve of the outbreak can be seen at <https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/epi.html>. It shows a flat curve over the outbreak length of approx. 1 year. - Mod.LL]As many as 35 people, recently purchased a puppy at Petland, visited a Petland store, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through Petland before illness began. One person had sexual contact with a person with a confirmed illness linked to Petland; 4 people were exposed to puppies from various sources; and 1 person had unknown puppy exposure. Ill people range in age from under 1 year to 86 years, with a median age of 23 years; 38 (69 percent) are female; and 13 (24 percent) report being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that puppies sold through Petland stores are a likely source of this outbreak. Petland is cooperating with public health and animal health officials to address this outbreak.Whole genome sequencing showed samples of _Campylobacter_ isolated from the stool of puppies sold through Petland were closely related to _Campylobacter_ samples isolated from the stool of ill people in multiple states. Clinical samples from people and puppies sickened in this outbreak appear to be resistant to commonly recommended, first-line antimicrobials. This means infections with the outbreak strain may not respond well to oral antimicrobials usually prescribed to treat Campylobacter_ infections.CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) team analyzed whole genome sequence data from _Campylobacter_ isolated from stools of 7 ill people and 6 ill puppies to look for genes that predict antibiotic resistance. Analysis suggests that all 13 isolates are resistant to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, and telithromycin. In addition, 9 isolates appear resistant to gentamicin, and 12 isolates appear resistant to tetracycline. Typically, predicted antimicrobial resistance using whole genome sequence data matches the results of traditional antimicrobial resistance testing for _Campylobacter_ [Zhao S, Tyson GH, Chen Y, et al: Whole genome sequencing accurately predicts antimicrobial resistance phenotypes in Campylobacter species. Appl Environ Microbiol 2015; 82: 459-66; available at <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711122/>]. NARMS performed traditional antimicrobial resistance testing on one isolate from an ill person. It showed resistance to the same antimicrobials that analysis of whole genome sequence data predicted: azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, telithromycin, and tetracycline._Campylobacter_ can spread through contact with dog feces. It usually does not spread from one person to another, however, activities such as changing an infected person's diapers or sexual contact with an infected person can lead to infection. Regardless of where they are from, any puppies and dogs may carry _Campylobacter_ germs. This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates as more information becomes available.Advice to Pet Owners at:<https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/index.html#petstore>.Advice to Pet Store Workers at:<https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/index.html#vets>.Advice to Clinicians at:<https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/index.html#clinicians>.Advice to Veterinarians at<https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/index.html#vets>.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Pet-associated campylobacteriosis is underappreciated in human _Campylobacter_ infection. The following is a recent review of the topic:Campagnolo ER, Philipp LM, Long JM and Hanshaw NL: Pet-associated Campylobacteriosis: A persisting public health concern. Zoonoses Public Health. 2017 Aug 21. doi: 10.1111/zph.12389. [Epub ahead of print]Abstract--------Campylobacter is regarded as a leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis in the USA. We report on a case of laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania among members of a household living with a laboratory-confirmed but non-speciated _Campylobacter_-infected puppy. We describe an outbreak of likely dog-associated campylobacteriosis, the risk factors, potential routes of exposure and the clinical features in the exposed family members, which began shortly after exposure to the recently purchased dog. We also provide public health recommendations to prevent _Campylobacter_ infections in veterinary care providers, pet owners and those planning to adopt pets in the future. Finally, this report underscores the importance of the One Health approach when public health responders, human and animal healthcare providers and clinical diagnostic laboratories are tasked with developing effective strategies when investigating, detecting and responding to zoonoses (diseases shared between animals and humans).- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
