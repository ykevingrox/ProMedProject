Geospatial analysis of nonmedical vaccine exemptions and pertussis outbreaks in the United States. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017;114(27):7101-7105. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1700240114. Epub 2017 Jun 20Significance------------Pertussis has been on the rise in the United States, and, in 2012, the United States had the highest number of reported pertussis (whooping cough) cases since 1955. This study provides evidence of spatial clustering of nonmedical vaccine exemptions in kindergarteners and spatial clustering of pertussis cases in children age groups 5 years and younger and 10 to 14 years at the community level. The results suggest that states should reconsider allowing nonmedical vaccine exemptions. The data also suggest a need for the creation of a longer-acting pertussis vaccine or improved regimen and a revised vaccination schedule for the current acellular pertussis vaccine.Abstract------Because of increased numbers of recorded pertussis cases in the United States, this study sought to understand the role of nonmedical vaccine exemptions and waning immunity may have had on the resurgence of pertussis in the United States at the community level. We used geospatial scan statistics, SaTScan, version 9.4, to analyze nonmedical vaccine exemptions of children entering kindergarten in 2011 and 2012 and reported pertussis cases in 2012 for children in age groups 5 years and younger and 10 to 14 years. Eight statistically significant clusters of nonmedical vaccine exemptions in kindergarteners and 11 statistically significant clusters of pertussis cases in children and adolescents were identified and geospatially linked. Forty-five percent of the counties in the study had high rates of nonmedical vaccine exemptions. The proportion of kindergarteners with nonmedical vaccine exemptions was 2.8 times larger in the identified exemption clusters. In addition, 31 counties had geographic clusters of high rates of pertussis in children ages 10 to 14 years old, consistent with waning immunity. Our findings are consistent with the view that geographic clusters of nonmedical vaccine exemptions and waning immunity may have been factors contributing to community-level pertussis outbreaks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Washington (Grant County)Date: Wed 28 Jun 2017Source: KHQ [edited]<http://www.khq.com/story/35771723/grant-county-health-district-investigates-confirmed-whooping-cough-cases>Grant County Health District staff are investigating 12 confirmed cases of pertussis (whooping cough), with additional tests pending. All confirmed cases are within the Ephrata and Moses Lake community. No one has been hospitalized at this time.All family members and those in close contact with those who have it have been notified by the health district and have started post-exposure prophylaxis. In an effort to control the spread of the disease, the health district has recommended antibiotics for anyone who has come in close contact with those individuals.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org> [Grant County, with a population of 89 120 residents, is in the center of the U.S. state of Washington; the county seat is Ephrata, and the largest city is Moses Lake.

To prevent the concern of parents, a health surveillance procedure has been initiated at the Regional Health Agency (ARS).The director of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste school (where 247 children are enrolled), Christophe Leuwers, takes the problem seriously but does not want to dramatize: ""What worries us the most are families who have already taken off for the holidays, and they will have to be contacted so that they can arrange a visit with their doctor for a medical check.""Only one [additional] case was identified and medically monitored at the Torchy Nursery, located in the social center of the same name. The ARS was informed, and the city provided individual information to families, children and supervisors. Children were also checked for their vaccines. A health watch is being provided by a pediatrician.It is difficult to distinguish whooping cough from a cold or a recurrent cough. A parent of a student, who is a doctor, 1st suspected this contamination in the school where a sibling seemed to be infected a fortnight ago. The family has since been followed medically, and the children have been confined to their homes.[Byline: Nicolas Andre]-- Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Arras, located in Northern France, is 182 km (113 miles) north of Paris, with a population of 43 693 residents, and the capital city of the Pas-de-Calais department, which forms part of the region of Hauts-de-France (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arras>).

""We do have over 30 cases that are confirmed,"" said Hanley. ""And it does not yet appear to have peaked."" Hanley said it seems outbreaks of whooping cough happen every few years when herd immunity drops. ""Every 4-5 years, you can almost predict that you'll see pertussis popping up in the community,"" he said. It's important that people know that pertussis is still spreading, and it's useful for people to know how to protect themselves and others. Hanley said there are 3 main pillars for protection: immunization, staying away from others until you're no longer contagious, and using antibiotics to reduce the spread of the disease.Immunization is the most effective way to lower the risk of whooping cough, said Hanley. It's especially important for infants and pregnant women to get the vaccine, he said. While antibiotics can help reduce the spread of whooping cough, people are still contagious for approximately 5 days after they start the treatment. ""Pertussis is very contagious, and, unfortunately, it's contagious for quite awhile,"" said Hanley. He urges people to keep this in mind when they start thinking about going back to work or sending their kids to daycare or other group settings.[Byline: Jamie-Lee McKenzie]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Yukon is the smallest and westernmost of Canada's 3 federal territories (the other 2 are the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).
