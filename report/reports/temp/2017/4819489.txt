The number of cases in this wave so far has been much higher than that in the same period last winter [2015-2016]. Cases imported from Guangdong have also been reported in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.""According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, about 90 per cent of the patients reported exposure to live poultry, mostly with exposure to live poultry markets (LPMs). There was also an increase in environmental contamination with H7N9 virus as reflected by the positive rate of environmental samples collected from LPMs or other live poultry-related environments in affected provinces.""Since the 1st human cases were reported in 2013, there have been 1107 cases as of [6 Feb 2017].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[4] Taiwan (Kaohsiung)Date: Sun 5 Feb 2017Source: Taipei Times[edited]<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/02/05/2003664365>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [4 Feb 2017] confirmed this year's 1st case of H7N9 avian influenza in a human -- a 69-year-old man who returned from China last month. CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said the man went to Yangjiang City in China's Guangdong Province in September last year [2016] and worked there until the Lunar New Year holiday last month [January 2017].""The man said he developed a fever and respiratory symptoms on [23 Jan 2017] before boarding a plane from Macau to Kaohsiung [Taiwan] for the holiday,"" Lo said. ""He is Taiwanese and a resident of Kaohsiung.""He said the man arrived in Taiwan on [25 Jan 2017] and personnel from the CDC quarantine station at Kaohsiung International Airport detected his fever and suggested that he seek medical attention at a hospital.A hospital diagnosed his condition as a suspected case of type A (H3N2) influenza, but after test results returned negative, the man was given antiviral medicine used to treat flu symptoms and was instructed to rest, Lo said.However, the man's fever persisted, and he started coughing up phlegm and having difficulty breathing on [Sun 29 Jan 2017], and was hospitalized with a suspected case of pneumonia at an intensive care unit on [Wed 1 Feb 2017], Lo said, adding that the patient's case was confirmed as an H7N9 avian influenza infection after the CDC examined a specimen sent by the hospital. ""H7N9 avian influenza is usually transmitted from birds to humans and its early symptoms are similar to those of flu, but the patient's condition rapidly worsens after a week, developing into a serious case of pneumonia, with a mortality rate of about 30 to 40 percent,"" he said.The patient is still in the intensive care unit, Lo said, adding that an investigation found that 2 of his colleagues in China had upper respiratory symptoms, but the symptoms subsided after they received medical treatment.The man's 2 relatives showed no avian influenza symptoms, Lo said, adding that the CDC will follow up on the condition of 108 people who had come into contact with the man recently.The CDC said that 261 cases of H7N9 avian influenza infection in humans have been reported in China since October last year [2016]. It urged the public to exercise caution and avoid direct exposure to poultry when traveling to China, as that nation is at the peak of its flu season.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Taiwan can be seen at <http://www.tmf.org.tw/index.php/maps-taiwan-overall-english-cd> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/50952>.The human cases of A/H7N9 avian influenza are creeping up and there has been a huge increase since December 2016, with nearly 300 lab confirmed cases reported (see item [3] above). No doubt the increased case numbers could be partly attributed to the enhanced surveillance and testing, but it is imperative that any changes in the viral genome that help improve human to human transmission be closely monitored. - Mod.UBA]
