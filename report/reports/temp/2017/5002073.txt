In the past 3 days there have been 4 newly confirmed cases reported from Saudi Arabia with one being an asymptomatic household contact of one of the Wadi Aldawasir cases. The remaining 3 cases involved 2 individuals with histories of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of their illness, and a 3rd individual whose high risk exposure history was still under investigation. Since the beginning of April 2017, there have been a total of 15 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia on the MOH MERS-CoV website.Since [Sun 5 Mar 2017], there have been 15 laboratory confirmed infections with MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia, associated with an outbreak in a renal dialysis unit. Seven of the 15 infections were in individuals who were asymptomatic and were identified through contact screening - 3 were secondary healthcare acquired infections in healthcare workers and 4 were secondary cases in household contacts.In Moon SY, Son JS. Infectivity of an Asymptomatic Patient With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection. Clin Infect Dis. 2017 Apr 22. doi:10.1093/cid/cix170. [Epub ahead of print], there was one asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected individual with 82 contacts identified, none of whom were found to be MERS-CoV infected leading the authors to conclude that asymptomatic infections with MERS-CoV were not significant players in the continued transmission of the virus.Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Qatar, Saudi Arabia - WHO update 27 Apr 2017Date: Thu 27 Apr 2017Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/27-april-2017-mers-saudi-arabia-and-qatar/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia and Qatar ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Between [18 Mar and 20 Apr 2017] the national IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 13 additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) including 2 fatal cases.
