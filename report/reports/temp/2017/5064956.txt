The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/swine-flu-jaundice-cases-see-sharp-rise-in-shimla/article18574254.ece>Hospitals in the capital town saw an unusual rush over the past week with several hundred people testing positive for jaundice after allegedly consuming polluted water.People from numerous suburbs have now complained about the alleged supply of contaminated and non-chlorinated water by the municipal and IPH authorities here. ""The authorities are not adding the required bleaching powder to the water sources and muddy water is coming from the taps,"" complained a resident who had fallen sick, even as many others echoed his concerns.Bleaching powder or hypochlorite is an inorganic compound used for treating water and is often used by the authorities here. The untimely arrival of rain and a massive hailstorm a few days ago also resulted in the contamination of drinking water sources.More than 20 people died in the State last year [2016] after the Jaundice epidemic started from Shimla. A major drinking water source of the town, Ashwani Khad was found polluted by the nearby sewerage pipelines.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There have been multiple media reports in 2016 and early 2017 [<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/jaundice-cases-return-in-shimla/articleshow/56820689.cms>] reporting jaundice cases associated with sewage contamination of water source.It is possible that the surge being reported is another outbreak linked to contaminated water reservoirs, which could have been precipitated due to heavy rainfall.Among various infectious causes of jaundice, hepatitis A and hepatitis E viruses are commonly acquired through water. Contaminated water is generally considered the main source of infection. Water may be infected either due to poor personal hygiene of food vendors or to sewage contamination of drinking water.If jaundice occurs in a large population around the same time, we should suspect contamination of the drinking water with sewage water.  Infectious jaundice can also develop after drinking contaminated bore well water, or by drinking stream water directly without purification.The spread of water borne infections such as hepatitis A can be reduced by: - Adequate supplies of safe drinking water; - Proper disposal of sewage within communities; and - Personal hygiene practices such as regular hand-washing with soap and safe water. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/304>.]
