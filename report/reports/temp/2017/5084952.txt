Dhaka Tribune [edited]<http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2017/06/05/7-people-infected-anthrax-pabna/>At least 7 people have been confirmed as infected with anthrax in Pabna's Bhangpur upazila [sub district, Rajshahi Division] after eating contaminated meat. The victims have been identified as NI, 28; B, 25; SA, 35; B, 40; S, 35; S, 28; and M, 30, reports UNB. All of them are involved in cattle trading.Upazila Health Complex's Health and Family Planning Officer Md Shahadat Hossain said they had taken ""necessary measures"" in this regard.Anthrax is a potentially deadly infectious disease caused by exposure to the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. The bacterium most commonly affects hoofed animals, but people who come in contact with the spores can also become infected. Infected people suffer fever, severe pain, and swollen tissues, often with lesions. The disease can be deadly if not treated immediately.Locals said that on [Fri 2 Jun 2017] a cow of neighbouring village in Faridpur upazila [Dhaka Division] was slaughtered after it had fallen sick. Later in the day, 7 people of Haropara village ate the tainted meat. Several hours later they fell sick, with blisters on their hands and legs, and complained of pain.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Pabna District is a district in north western Bangladesh. It is the southernmost district of Rajshahi Division. Its administrative capital is eponymous Pabna town; see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabna_District>. Rajshahi saw many outbreaks in 2016.It is informative that the 7 cases came from Bhangpur upazila but the affected cow was slaughtered and butchered in Faridpur upazila (village) of Dhaka Division. Presumably, from the description of the cutaneous lesions on hands and legs, they were Haropara relatives of the Faridpur owner of the cow, and came over to help slaughter and butcher it. Logically we can therefore expect to see reports of further human cases in Faridpur and maybe other villages that purchased some of this contaminated meat. And where there is one cow with anthrax, there will be others in Faridpur, and certainly the other cattle in this village need to be vaccinated as soon as possible, if not yesterday. - Mod.MHJMaps of Bangladesh can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Bangladesh.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34103>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
