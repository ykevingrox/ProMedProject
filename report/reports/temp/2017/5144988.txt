The sentences ""Rocky Mountain wood ticks and American dog ticks paralyze dogs. Both are common in Colorado. Only female ticks can cause paralysis by eventually affecting a dog's respiratory system, veterinarians say.""Whereas it is true that Rocky Mountain wood ticks (_Dermacentor andersoni_) and American dog ticks (_Dermacentor variabilis_) can cause paralysis in dogs (and other vertebrates, including humans), they are not the only ticks that can do this. Ticks of scores of different species also can cause paralysis in vertebrates, 5 in North America. The reason only female ticks can cause paralysis is that only female ticks take blood meals.That the emergency veterinarian said the dog's paralysis ""likely stemmed from genetic issues"" shows that not all veterinarians are alike.The statement by the University of Colorado hospital physician, if quoted correctly, is misleading and incorrect. That people ""with pets should be aware of the potential dangers of tick-borne illnesses"" is true but not relevant to this situation; tick paralysis is not a tick-borne illness.I do not know what ""There are certainly things that are unique to Colorado that we wouldn't necessarily see outside"" means but that ""Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Colorado tick fever"" are 2 diseases ""that are generally exclusive to our state"" is generally incorrect. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the most frequently reported rickettsial illness in the U.S., caused by a bacterium, _Rickettsia rickettsii_ , has been diagnosed throughout the Americas. Colorado tick fever, caused by a virus (Colorado tick fever virus, family _Reoviridae, genus _Coltivirus_), certainly occurs in Colorado but occurs also in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.--Charles H.
