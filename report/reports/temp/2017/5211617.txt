WHO [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/weekly-update-cholera-yemen-27-july-2017>Weekly update - Cholera in Yemen, 27 July 2017----------------------------------------------The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen has reported a cumulative total of 408 583 suspected cases of cholera including 1885 associated deaths as of [Wed 26 Jul 2017] for the outbreak which started in October 2016. The overall case-fatality rate of 0.5 percent remains below the emergency threshold of 1 percent. However it is higher in Raymah (1.2 percent), Ibb (0.8 percent) and Hajjah (0.8 percent). The number of suspected cholera cases and deaths has declined compared to previous weeks, although there is a backlog of case information currently under review, and these numbers could change.WHO and health partners support the Ministry through the cholera task force to improve cholera response efforts at the national and local levels. This includes the establishment of 47 diarrhoea treatment facilities and 278 oral dehydration centres in 16 governorates; training of health workers to manage cases, water purification in communities, deployment of rapid response team to manage cholera cases investigations and respond to the outbreak, and enhancement of Yemen's disease early warning surveillance systems. Since [Thu 27 Apr 2017], WHO has provided more than 788 000 bags of intravenous fluids, 525 beds with cleaning supplies and 112 kits containing supplies for the treatment of cholera and diarrhoeal diseases.A reactive cholera vaccination campaign using one million single doses of vaccine has been postponed at the request of health authorities in favour of a 2-dose preventative vaccination campaign next year [2018] targeting more people in the highest risk districts, based on the availability of the vaccine in the global stockpile.While cholera is endemic in Yemen, the country has experienced a surge in cholera cases since April [2017], with nearly 5000 cases reported per day. Ongoing conflict, destroyed health, water and sanitation infrastructure and malnutrition have caused the people to be more vulnerable to diseases, including cholera.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[[Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 182825 Jul / 402 484 / 188026 Jul / 408 583 / 1885In the last complete year of data (2015; <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>), WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
