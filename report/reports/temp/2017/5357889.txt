The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) has not been able to identify the source of the _Salmonella_ that has recently infected at leaståÊ7 people. All 7 reportåÊeating at the Joe &åÊThe Juice restaurant at the Oslo Airport recentlyåÊwhile traveling.Joe & The Juice, aåÊDanish-born juice bar and coffee shop once found mostly in European airports, isåÊopening locations in 2017 from San Francisco to Chicago.NIPH is monitoring the outbreak to determine if it will be limited to the existing cases or if it will grow larger. The same DNA ""fingerprint"" for _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium bacterium has been confirmed in all 7 victims, suggesting a common source. While the same airport restaurant connects the sickened individuals, their residences are disconnected, scattered throughout the country. The NIPH investigation began in August whenåÊthe victimsåÊbegan experiencing diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. Norway sees only about 1200 to 2000 salmonellosis illnesses annually. About 70 percent of those are from infections contractedåÊoutside of the country. Most of the other infections are from imported foods. Food produced in Norway and Norwegian livestock are rarely sources of _Salmonella_ contamination. Some strains of the bacterium have become established among wild Norwegian fauna, particularly among small birds and hedgehogs. Every year, these _Salmonella_ strains do cause instances of disease in humans. However, aåÊnationwide salmonellosis outbreak in Norway in 2013 involved the serotype Coeln, sickening 26 people from age 2 to 81. A pre-cut salad mix was determined to be the likely cause of that outbreak.More international travel and more imported foods are combining to keep salmonellosis as the second most common diarrheal disease in Norway.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As reported by one of the EpiCore Global Surveillance participants recently, a common restaurant appears to be linking the recent cases of salmonellosis in Norway although the specific vehicle for transmission is not clear at this point.Pre-harvest control of _Salmonella_ in food producing animals as well as control of imported food is the major reason for the low prevalence (in primary production) and incidence (in humans) in Sweden, Norway, and Finland. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/107>.]
