The isolate was submitted to the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories for confirmatory testing using Laboratory Response Network (LRN) reference methods. Hospital A laboratory personnel reported that the isolate had been manipulated on the open bench and certain laboratory workers had potentially been exposed. The Division of Public Health, hospital A, and Eastern Idaho Public Health initiated an investigation to confirm _F. tularensis_, assess potential laboratory exposures, and determine the source of infection. The investigation determined that the infectious agent was veillonella and not _F. tularensis_.The patient, a man aged over 75 years, had a multiyear history of chronic unilateral knee pain, during which time he had received a series of 3 intra-articular injections of hyaluronate sodium 2 years previously, and several intra-articular injections of triamcinolone with bupivacaine, the last of which occurred 15 days before he sought care at hospital A for a swollen knee. Gram staining of an intra-articular aspirate obtained that day from the affected knee showed Gram-variable cocci. The aspirate was cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Slow-growing colonies of Gram negative cocci were observed from the anaerobic culture, with limited growth in aerobic conditions. Because an anaerobic AMIS panel was not available, isolates from the aerobic culture were processed for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility on the AMIS using a panel specific for aerobic organisms. Identification of _F. tularensis_ by the AMIS triggered notification of the Division of Public Health and revision of the patient's antimicrobial regimen from vancomycin, piperacillin, and tazobactam to ciprofloxacin. Eastern Idaho Public Health interviewed the patient and determined that he lived in a rural area and reported no recent exposure to potential sources of naturally occurring _F. tularensis_ (for example, ill animals, arthropod bites, contaminated water, or use of lawn mowers or string trimmers near dead animals).The Idaho Bureau of Laboratories and Eastern Idaho Public Health provided the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] guidance on tularemia laboratory exposure (1) to hospital A and assisted staff members in assessing potential exposures of laboratory personnel. Among 24 employees interviewed by hospital A, 19 were considered to have potential exposure; all 19 elected to start antimicrobial prophylaxis because of a high level of concern regarding risk and the approximately 48 hours required for confirmatory testing.Using LRN real-time polymerase chain reaction methods, the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories tested the isolate for _F. tularensis_ and _Brucella spp_.; no _F. tularensis_ or _Brucella spp_ DNA was detected. Subsequent partial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing identified a _Veillonella sp_. According to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, Veillonella species-level identification could not be reported because the 16S rRNA gene fragment had a more than 99 per cent sequence identity for both _V. parvula_ and _V. dispar_ without a  less than 0.8 per cent difference between them (2). Partial RNA polymerase subunit B gene (rpoB) sequencing conducted on the isolate found a more than 99 per cent sequence identity to V. parvula_, suggesting this as the most likely species of the isolate (3). After identification of _Veillonella sp_., the patient's antimicrobial regimen was changed to piperacillin, tazobactam, and ertapenem sodium; personnel who were receiving prophylactic antimicrobials for potential _F. tularensis_ exposure were informed that continuation of prophylaxis was not recommended or necessary. The Division of Public Health reviewed MedWatch data and did not identify any reports of veillonella infection associated with hyaluronate sodium, triamcinolone, or bupivacaine. The source of this patient's infection was not determined._Veillonella spp._ are small, slow-growing, nonmotile anaerobic Gram negative cocci found as part of the normal flora of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and vaginal tracts. Although _Veillonella spp._ are classified as anaerobes, anaerobic organisms (including _Veillonella spp._) have been observed growing in aerobic conditions for a limited time after isolation before becoming nonviable (4). Often considered contaminants of clinical specimen collection, _Veillonella spp._ have been rarely isolated from monomicrobial cultures of invasive infections. Predisposing factors for invasive infection have not been fully studied, but might include local or systemic immune suppression and localized anaerobic conditions produced by tissue necrosis, diminished blood supply, or prolonged infection with aerobes (5).This is the 1st published report of misidentification of _Veillonella sp._ as _F. tularensis_ by an AMIS and of isolation of _Veillonella sp._ from a nonprosthetic knee. Hospital and public health staff members responded appropriately to the preliminary misidentification of the isolate as _F. tularensis_; however, accurate identification would have obviated the need for time-intensive response activities, use of prophylactic antimicrobials by hospital staff members, and inappropriately targeted antimicrobial therapy for the patient. Clinical laboratories are advised not to use a commercial AMIS if a select agent is suspected in a clinical sample (6) and to consult with their LRN-biologic laboratory for guidance and sample referral. Clinicians should consider _Veillonella spp._ when receiving laboratory reports of _F. tularensis_ generated by AMISs. Because _Veillonella spp._ are typically resistant to recommended or alternative antimicrobial therapies for tularemia (i.e., streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, and other fluoroquinolones), antibacterial coverage for both _Veillonella spp._ and _F. tularensis_ could be considered until final microbial identification is available.[authors: Carter KK, Peterson EM, Voermans RL, et al]* Tier 1 select agents are biologic agents and toxins that present the greatest risk for deliberate misuse with significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence, and pose a severe threat to public health and safety.References----------1.

A variety of anaerobes, such as veillonella, can grow initially aerobically only to become non viable.2. Injection of sterile body cavities with corticosteroids can produce infections with unusual organisms.3. Automated microbiological identification systems, even with a high degree of confidence, can misidentify organisms.4. Identification of Tier 1 organisms should always be confirmed by genetic or newer technology such as Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/215>.]
