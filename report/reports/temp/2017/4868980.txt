7th Space [edited]<https://goo.gl/jO3b5B>The [Hong Kong] Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [Mon 27 Feb 2017] investigating a suspected outbreak of upper respiratory tract infection (URI) in a sheltered workshop in Eastern District, and appealed to members of the public to stay alert and maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene.The outbreak involves 6 men and 16 women (19 attendees and 3 staff) aged 26 to 68, who have developed URI symptoms including cough, runny nose and sore throat since [Sun 12 Feb 2017]. As many as 20 patients sought medical advice and none required hospitalisation. They are currently in stable condition.Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the sheltered workshop to adopt necessary infection control measures against respiratory tract infections. The workshop has been placed under medical surveillance.The public should maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against influenza and other respiratory illnesses:- receive seasonal influenza vaccination for personal protection;- wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;- when hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;- cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;- dispose of soiled tissue paper properly in a lidded rubbish bin;- put on a surgical mask when respiratory symptoms develop;- maintain good indoor ventilation;- when influenza is prevalent, avoid going to crowded or poorly ventilated public places; high-risk individuals may consider putting on surgical masks when staying in such places; and- maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.Members of the public, particularly children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases, should wear a face mask and consult a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of respiratory tract infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[No updates have been received on the undiagnosed respiratory outbreak. The report does not specify whether any laboratory diagnostic test have been done in theses cases.Upper respiratory tract infections (URI) can be caused by a variety of viruses, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus; and by bacteria, including _Chlamydia pneumonia_, _Mycoplasma pneumonia_, _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _S. pneumoniae_, _Bordetella pertussis_, and _Haemophilus influenza_ [1, 2]. Clinical symptoms of URI are highly variable and cannot be used to identify the etiologic agent or agents. Although the majority of URIs are caused by viruses (69 percent) [3], antibiotics are widely and inappropriately prescribed to treat symptoms.References----------1.
