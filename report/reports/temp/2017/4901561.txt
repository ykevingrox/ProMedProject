My wife was the other case.----------------------------------------------------------------------My wife collapsed into hantavirus pulmonary syndrome this last Thanksgiving night [24 Nov 2016]. She spent 6 days on the ventilator, 10 in ICU, and barely lived.We have confirmed Sin Nombre virus infection, through 2 sets of IgG and IgM tests from the CDC. We are convinced that she was infected through her automobile cabin air system, which had repeated infestations with deer mice.I am a scientist and she is an RN, and we have studied our potential exposure sources in some detail. I've set up a website at <http://www.hantasite.com> to explore the physical chemistry and epidemiology of hantavirus exposure. I've posted 40 or 50 images of auto rodent infestations. This is potentially a way that many people may be contracting hantavirus, without it being diagnosed.I've contacted the brother of the hantavirus [infection] victim, and they think their cars may be the source in their case too. I don't know their reasoning for that yet.--Mark C Waterbury, PhD (materials scientist)Perception Development Co<waterbury.mark@gmail.com>[The possibility of transmission of Sin Nombre virus to people through automobile air systems is intriguing. These forced air systems could certainly generate aerosolized particulate mouse excreta that could contain the virus, making the automobile an effective transmission chamber, particularly in colder weather when the blower for the heating system is on and the windows are closed.Interested readers are encouraged to read Dr Waterbury's website (URL listed above). It has additional information about his wife's case, and at the end of the site there are galleries of photos of rodent nests in automobile air systems. It also has nice images of the deer mice reservoir host.Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including Washington state. Deer mice commonly move into dwellings, and apparently into automobiles, with the onset of cold weather. Cleaning out deer mouse nests from automobile air systems should be done with the same precautions as for cleaning out unoccupied cabins. Materials should be wetted down with a bleach solution, materials handled in an open air space, with gloves and a mask worn.Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus and shed it in feces, urine, and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.Dr Waterbury is thanked for sharing this case and situation with ProMED.A map showing the location of Washington state in the northwest of the lower 48 USA states can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3248>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Hantavirus - Americas (18): USA (TX) susp 20170224.4858591Hantavirus - Americas (17): USA, Canada, WHO 20170222.4855724Hantavirus - Americas (16): Chile (LR), Argentina (BA), USA (PA) 20170220.4850930Hantavirus - Americas (15): USA (UT) 20170215.4841686Hantavirus - Americas (07): USA (IL,WI) Seoul virus, comment 20170123.4784492Hantavirus - Americas (05): USA (IL,WI) Seoul virus 20170122.47826612016----Hantavirus update - Americas (46): USA 20161220.4710663Hantavirus update - Americas (45): USA (NM) 20161209.4688061Hantavirus update - Americas (39): USA (CO) 20160813.4414971Hantavirus update - Americas (38): USA (UT) fatal 20160810.4407613Hantavirus update - Americas (34): USA (ND) 20160721.4360405Hantavirus update - Americas (33): USA (NM) fatal 20160630.4319679Hantavirus update - Americas (31): USA (NM), fatal 20160616.4291571Hantavirus update - Americas (30): USA (UT) 20160603.4264532Hantavirus update - Americas (28): USA (CO), Chile (BI) 20160520.4235672Hantavirus update - Americas (27): USA (MT, NM) 20160517.4227845Hantavirus update - Americas (23): USA (CO) 20160424.4179685Hantavirus update - Americas (18): USA (NM) 20160406.4142637Hantavirus update - Americas (16): USA (AZ) 20160325.4119418Hantavirus update - Americas (07): USA (NM) 20160205.3997720Hantavirus update - Americas (05): USA (AZ) 20160126.3967940Hantavirus update - Americas (03): USA (AZ) comment 20160116.3942572Hantavirus update - Americas (02): USA (AZ) 20160114.3936962].................................................dk/ty/mj/dk"
