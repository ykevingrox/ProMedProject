He had previously visited STIDH on 5 Jan 2017 with a 10-day history of high-grade fever (>102F), red eyes, cough, chest pain and headache. An eschar was seen on his right shoulder.Doctors in Nepal believe that people are less likely to get scrub typhus infection in the winter season, and hence [this disease] is more likely to be misdiagnosed. However, patients with symptoms and laboratory findings similar to scrub typhus have continued [to visit] this hospital, indicating that the scrub typhus may still [be] spreading, perhaps in various geographical locations of Nepal.--Sher Bahadur Pun MD, PhDClinical Research UnitSukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease HospitalKathmandu,Nepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions.Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of a 6-legged chigger, the larval form of the trombiculid family of 8-legged mites. Chiggers are most active during warmer summer months (<https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2000/06/got-chiggers-it-figures>). They live in shaded grassy areas and tend to be more abundant during rainy spells because they need a high-level of humidity in order to survive. During the heat of the afternoon or during long dry spells, they may retreat toward the soil. Once chiggers have fed on humans, they drop off of their host and transform into nymphs, which then develop into adult mites that feed on plant material and are harmless to humans.The average daytime temperatures in November are around 15C (about 60F) with a low temperature of 9C (about 48F) at night in Kathmandu, Nepal; December is the beginning of the winter season when the average high temperature is 18C (about 65F) dropping to a low of 4C (38F); January is the coldest month of the year with an average high temperature of 17C (about 63F) and low of 2C (about 36F) (<http://www.holiday-weather.com/kathmandu/averages/january/>).For a further discussion of scrub typhus, see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (03): (MP, RJ) fatal 20140921.2791699. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/139>.][See Also:2016----Scrub typhus - Nepal (10): (CT) fatal, more cases 20161118.4639756Scrub typhus - Nepal (09): (Banke) 20161103.4603729Scrub typhus - Nepal (08): (CT) fatal, more cases 20161010.4549812Scrub typhus - Nepal (07): (DH) hearing loss 20160910.4478353Scrub typhus - Nepal (06): (CT) fatal 20160831.4455863Scrub typhus - Nepal (05): (DH) 20160830.4450349Scrub typhus - Nepal (04): (TN) fatal 20160826.4442332Scrub typhus - Nepal (03): (KT) unusual clinical presentation 20160822.4433568Scrub typhus - Nepal (02): fatal 20160816.4417397Scrub typhus - Nepal: (UD) 20160728.43775982015----Scrub typhus - Nepal (03): (NA) 20151127.3824087Scrub typhus - Nepal (02): (KT) 20151020.3728816Scrub typhus - Nepal: (KT,DH) fatal 20151006.3693673].................................................ml/ao/dk"
