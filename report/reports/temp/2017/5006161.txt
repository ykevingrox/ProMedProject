Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(6) [date cited] <http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2306.162018>---------------------------------------------------------------------Members of the genus _Brucella_ are the infectious agents of brucellosis, a neglected disease responsible for economic losses resulting from abortion and low performance in production animals (1). The 4 species mainly responsible for this widespread bacterial zoonosis are _B. melitensis_, _B. abortus_, _B. suis_, and to a lesser extent _B. canis_. Underdiagnosis and limited awareness of the disease among healthcare practitioners is common in many countries (1)._B. neotomae_, isolated in 1957 from wood rats (_Neotoma lepida_) in North America (2), has been considered nonzoonotic (3). It has been isolated from target organs of experimentally infected mice and guinea pigs (4,5). We report the isolation of _B. neotomae_ from cerebrospinal fluid samples from 2 human patients with neurobrucellosis.The study---------In 2008, a _Brucella_ sp. isolate was submitted to the Tropical Diseases Research Center at the Universidad de Costa Rica. This isolate (denoted strain bneohCR2) was cultured from a cerebrospinal fluid sample obtained from a 64 year old male patient at one of the main hospitals in San JosÌ©, Costa Rica. In 2011, another isolate (denoted strain bneohCR1) was recovered from a cerebrospinal fluid sample from a 51 year old male patient at a regional hospital in Costa Rica. As is common for other patients with brucellosis, the blood leukocyte count for each patient was almost within the reference range, and C-reactive protein level was within reference range. Both patients showed clinical signs compatible with neurobrucellosis (6), had positive Rose Bengal test results, and recovered after receiving 1 month of streptomycin (750 mg/d) and 3 months of doxycycline (100 mg/12 h).Further bacteriologic analysis (7,8) confirmed that the isolates were a _Brucella_ sp.) (table and figures [see source URL above - Mod.LL]). Real-time PCR high-resolution melting analysis (9) confirmed genus designation but was inconclusive regarding species designation. Bruce-ladder multiplex PCR (10) and multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats-16-loci panel analysis indicated that the profiles for both DNA isolates corresponded to profiles for _B. neotomae_. Analysis of bneohCR2 by multiplex single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) primer extension assay (11) and by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of protein extracts (12) (Technical Appendix [<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/16-2018-techapp1.pdf> Table 1) confirmed that the isolate was _B. neotomae_.[The whole genome sequencing analysis can be found at the source URL above - Mod.LL]Conclusions-----------This report of _B. neotomae_ as a cause of zoonotic disease raises questions about possible underrepresentation of reported cases. This study also has implications for brucellosis diagnosis. Specifically, the differences among _B. neotomae_ and the other _Brucella_ species at the biochemical level are subtle. The major difference between _B. neotomae_ and _B. abortus_, the main cause of human brucellosis in Costa Rica, is the presence of oxidase activity in _B. abortus_, which is assessed subjectively (7,8). Because _B. neotomae_ has not, until now, been considered zoonotic, some cases of brucellosis reported as being caused by atypical zoonotic classical Brucella might have been misdiagnosed cases of _B. neotomae_ infection. The introduction of whole-genome sequencing into the clinical field will thus improve diagnosis.A lack of epidemiologic information with regard to the 2 patients reported here precluded the investigation of exposure or contact with hosts known to harbor _B. neotomae_. Further studies are needed to establish which animals may act as reservoirs for _B. neotomae_ in Costa Rica.In summary, _B. neotomae_ should be considered a zoonosis risk for infection in humans. Incorporation of molecular techniques for diagnosis will help resolve the _Brucella_ genus homogeneity obtained when only biochemical assays are used.References----------1. WHO.

Both isolates were obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurobrucellosis, an unusual manifestation of brucellosis. It is not clear if _B. neotomae_ preferentially causes neurobrucellosis and has been underdiagnosed in the past because of inadequate molecular analytic tools.The summary of a 2009 review on neurobrucellosis (Gula HC, Erdema H, Semai Bekb S. Overview of neurobrucellosis: a pooled analysis of 187 cases. Int J Infect Dis 2009; 13(6): e339-343) is reproduced below:""Central nervous system involvement is a serious complication of brucellosis; data found in the literature are generally restricted to case reports and case series. In this study we pooled the data from Turkish medical practice in order to gain a thorough understanding of the subject. A search of Turkish publications on chronic neurobrucellosis was made using both Turkish and international databases. A total of 35 publications were analyzed and 187 neurobrucellosis cases were evaluated. Headache, fever, sweating, weight loss, and back pain were the predominant symptoms, while meningeal irritation, confusion, hepatomegaly, hypoesthesia, and splenomegaly were the most frequent findings. The major complications in patients were cranial nerve involvement, polyneuropathy/radiculopathy, depression, paraplegia, stroke, and abscess formation. Antibiotics were used in different combinations and over different intervals. The duration of antibiotic therapy reported ranged from 2 to 15 months (median 5 months). The mortality was 0.5 per cent with suitable antimicrobials. Neurobrucellosis may mimic various pathologies. For this reason, a thorough evaluation of the patient with probable disease is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and proper management of the disease.""- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/17>.]
