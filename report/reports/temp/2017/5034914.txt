Reportedly, apart from the number of deaths registered, close to 8500 people are ill. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate the patients as the influx is increasing day by day.""We now are facing a serious outbreak of cholera,"" said ICRC director of operations Dominik Stillhart at a news conference in the capital Sanaa. Citing figures compiled by the Yemeni health ministry, Stillhart said 115 people had died of cholera between 27 Apr 2017 and yesterday [13 May 2017].More than 8500 suspected cases of the waterborne disease were reported in the same period in 14 governorates across Yemen, Stillhart said, up from 2300 cases in 10 governorates last week. This is the 2nd outbreak of cholera in less than a year in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country. Yemen is witnessing a devastating war between the Saudi- supported government and Iranian-backed Huthi rebels, and less than half of the country's health facilities are functioning 2 years into the conflict.Stillhart said hospitals were filled beyond capacity with patients displaying symptoms of cholera, a bacterial infection contracted through ingesting contaminated food or water.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the numbers have varied from various sources, the outbreak beginning in late October 2016 had caused 15 658 cases and 99 deaths by 11 Jan 2017 and 22 181 cases and 103 deaths by 26 Feb 2017, with suggestions that that epidemic was subsiding. ProMED posted reports of cholera clusters in Washah province on 2 Apr 2017 and Beni Yus province on 17 Apr 2017, and then, coinciding with a report from the capital Sana'a on 5 May 2017, the epidemic seemed to return with increasing numbers.Date [2017] / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8500 / 115A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>. - Mod.LL]
