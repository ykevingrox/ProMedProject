The Sacramento (CA) Bee [edited]<http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article166376727.html>An _E. coli_-contaminated lake in Nevada County linked to the illnesses of 14 people will remain closed until at least 23 Aug 2017, county officials announced [Wed 9 Aug 2017]. Authorities closed all of Lake Wildwood's public beaches last week [week of 1 Aug 2017] after water testing confirmed reports linking _E. coli_ infections to the lake's Main Beach, also called Commodore Park. The county also advised against any swimming in the lake.As of Wed 9 Aug 2017, 14 people, 11 children and 3 adults, are believed to have contracted [enterohemorrhagic] _E. coli_ after visiting the Main Beach and, in many cases, ingesting lake water, according to the Nevada County Public Health Department. Lab results so far confirm 11 of those 14 cases are connected to the lake's bacteria. By [Tue 8 Aug 2017], 9 people had been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak, county Public Health Coordinator Patti Carter said. 6 had been discharged by Wednesday evening [9 Aug 2017]. 4 sickened children developed a serious condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to potentially fatal kidney failure and anemia. Most people with the syndrome recover, according the public health department.Based on recommendations from the California Department of Public Health and the CDC, the county said, the lake's beaches will reopen when contamination levels in the water become safe and after 3 ""incubation periods"" pass since the latest date someone was exposed to the bacteria. An incubation period is the time it takes for someone to begin showing symptoms after ingesting _E. coli_. That means the lake could open [23 Aug 2017] at the earliest, given that [23 Jul 2017] was the last known day someone was exposed to the _E. coli_, the public health department said.""Unfortunately, this is a natural bathing area, and unlike a swimming pool, chemicals cannot be added to remedy the _E. coli_ bacteria,"" Amy Irani, the county's environmental health director, told The Bee last week [week of 1 Aug 2017]. ""Time is what is needed, and thus the closures will remain in effect until further notice.""The county's Environmental Health Department is testing Lake Wildwood's water twice each week at 8 locations to monitor contamination. Results from samples taken [Mon 7 Aug 2017], showed unusually high levels of sickness-causing bacteria at 7 spots, with the highest concentrations around Meadow Park, the county reported. Bacteria levels in that area were more than 12 times the minimum needed for beach closure. All 5 of Lake Wildwood's public beaches remain closed as a precaution even though only 3 of the beaches are being repeatedly tested, the county's public health department said.Authorities are investigating the source of the _E. coli_, testing feces found in the area and sand, as well as water sources that feed into the lake. The county also tested nearby wastewater and canals.[Byline: Hannah Knowles]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection has risen to 14 with 4 of the 11 children developing HUS (hemolytic-uremic syndrome). It is not stated whether the organism is serotype O157:H7 or one of the other serotypes that produce Shiga toxin. Although the posting states that bacterial levels in the water were above ""safe"" limits, the results are likely reflective of an overall coliform level not of Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ specifically, but does reflect fecal contamination. - Mod.LLThe state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62262>.
