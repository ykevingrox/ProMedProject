BBC [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-39983062>The number of confirmed cases of hepatitis A linked to a bakery in North Lanarkshire has increased to 61. Health officials have urged the public to be on the lookout for symptoms of the infection, especially people living in Airdrie and Coatbridge. The outbreak has been linked to products sold by the JB Christie bakery in Airdrie. Hepatitis A is a viral infection that leads to inflammation of the liver and can cause mild to severe illness.Dr Femi Oshin, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in public health medicine, said: ""Some people who have become infected with hepatitis A, can feel well and have no symptoms for several weeks prior to developing symptoms and becoming unwell. However, during this time they can be infectious to others. ""Others - especially younger children and babies - may become infected and not develop any symptoms, yet may be infectious to others for several weeks.""This is why we are continuing to raise awareness of the infection to help us identify other possible cases so that treatment can be provided if appropriate and to prevent further spread of the infection.""The bakery closed for a short period after it was 1st linked to the outbreak at the beginning of May 2017 but reopened after staff tested negative for the infection and the premises were given a deep clean. Health officials later praised the bakery for its co-operation during the investigation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The initial investigation and assessment at the bakery indicated that products produced and sold between [Mon 20 Mar and Thu 13 Apr 2017] may have been affected. It is now 35 days from 13 April 2017 so with an incubation period up to about 45 days, the number of cases may rise somewhat more. Secondary household cases may also occur.Outbreaks such as this one and others in the past underscore the need for universal immunization of food workers. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/280>.]
