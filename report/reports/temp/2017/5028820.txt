Chronicle [edited]<http://www.chronicle.co.zw/2-crocodiles-hippos-die/>Two crocodiles and more hippos have died in the Mlibizi area of Binga [district Matabeleland North] with authorities saying further tests must be carried out to establish the cause of the continued deaths. This is the 1st time that crocodiles have died in the Mlibizi River where hippos started dying in March of this year [2017].Some people ate meat from the carcasses of hippos leading to the death of at least 2 people from suspected anthrax. Fish also started dying before the reported deaths of crocodiles. Acting ZimParks spokesperson Mr Simulai Nyasha said yesterday [9 May 2017] that 2 crocodiles that died over the weekend [6-7 May 2017] were approximately 3 to 4 months old. He said that the hippos' deaths toll had risen from 16 to 21.""Two crocodiles also died over the weekend and several fish died in the past weeks in the same river. The crocodiles were discovered approximately 3 km [about 2 mi] from the point where dead hippos were found. The total hippo deaths recorded is now 21,"" he sad. ""We have again engaged the Veterinary Department to do further tests to ascertain the cause of deaths. On the hippos we suspect it is still anthrax,"" said Mr Nyasha.Two people died from suspect anthrax after eating the hippos' meat. Anthrax is a life threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals.Over the past 3 years hundreds of elephants have died to suspected cyanide poisoning allegedly administered by poachers at Hwange National Park and the Zambezi valley. Some illegal hunters have been arrested and charged with poaching and possessing cyanide.[Byline: Winnie Masara]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Zimbabwe can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/zimbabwe.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59888>.For a description of Matabeleland North on the western border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matabeleland_North_Province>.

Young crocodiles, 3-4 months old, are small, say around 24 inches or 61 cm long, and once dead would be swept downstream from wherever they had died. It was observant of the ZimParks rangers to have found them. Until it is confirmed that they died of anthrax, we must presume that they died of whatever routinely takes young Zim crocodiles in the Zambezi valley ecosystem. And it is comforting to not hear of any further human deaths. - Mod.MHJ]
