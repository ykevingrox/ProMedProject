EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The Department of Health is investigating the possibility of cholera as the cause of the diarrhea due to contaminated water. BUCOR (Bureau of Corrections) sources mentioned that possibly the well water was contaminated by seepage of dirty water as the result of the onset of the rainy season.(As reported), 2 inmates died due to dehydration. Both were diabetic. The caterer denied that the food (milk fish) they served was the source of the diarrhea.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[If cases continued to occur over a period of days beyond the incubation period of a point-source food-associated outbreak, the possibility of contaminated water becomes more significant. An epidemiologic curve showing cases over time could assist in this matter. Earlier postings have implied that diagnostic information would be available soon.Again, ProMED-mail thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for this posting. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52574>.]
