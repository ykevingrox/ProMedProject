The company recalled 133 pounds of their ground beef on [Fri 13 Oct 2017] after a sample tested positive for the bacterium, according to USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The ground beef was produced and packaged on July 24 and 25 [2017]. The company sold the recalled product at Bread and Butter farm in Shelburne, VT, according to the FSIS recall notice.Subject to recall are: - 1-pound vacuum sealed packages of ""Bread & Butter Farm Ground Beef"""", lot code #072517BNB - 1-pound vacuum sealed packages of ""Bread & Butter Farm Ground Beef"", lot code #072417BNBThe recalled products have the establishment number ""EST. 9558"" printed inside the USDA mark of inspection.The problem was discovered [Sat 30 Sep 2017] when the firm notified FSIS of an investigation of _E. coli_ O157:H7 illnesses.""Vermont Department of Health and the CDC FSIS determined the cooked beef burgers that were served at an event at Bread & Butter Farm was the probable source of the reported illnesses."" According to the recall notice, ""2 case-patients were identified in Vermont with illness onset dates ranging from 18 Sep 2017 to 23 Sep 2017.""

While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among people of any age, but is most common in children younger than 5, older adults, pregnant women and people with suppressed immune systems. HUS is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. People who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in customers' freezers. Customers who purchased the Vermont Livestock Slaughter and Processing ground beef are urged not to consume it. The meat should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.[Byline: Kelsey M.
