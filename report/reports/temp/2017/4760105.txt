She showed rabies symptoms 2 weeks after being bitten by a dog wandering near the family home.To reduce the risk of contracting this deadly disease, it is recommended to avoid contact with domestic or wild animals and to make anti-rabies immunoglobulin [sic!] vaccines the earliest after contact with the carrier animal took place.[Byline: R. Kebbabi]--Communicated by:ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[A case of human rabies, which occurred on a little girl in the province of Boumerdes, was diagnosed in a hospital in Algiers, 45 km [28 mi] far from Boumerdes city.It is regrettable that this case could not be avoided. Here, one can only recall the basic measures of the national rabies control program: public awareness of the danger posed by rabies and education about what to do in the case of a bite by an animal suspected of rabies; compulsory vaccination of owned carnivores and organization of slaughter campaigns to reduce the population of stray animals; availability and ease of access to local anti-rabies centers for emergency treatment in case of bites. - Mod.AB]******[2] Israel: 2016 annual dataDate: Sun 1 Jan 2017Source: Circular, Field Veterinary Services - Israel [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, edited]Rabies Events - No. 28. Yotvata. & No 29, Even Menachem-------------------------------------------------------Rabies was diagnosed on [Mon 26 Dec 2016] in a dead fox from Yotvata. The corpse was found about 400 m [approx. 437 yards] from the horse stable of Yotvata, where a rabid fox was found 2 weeks ago [week 12 to 18 Dec 2016]. The dead fox was submitted to the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) at Beit-Dagan, where rabies was diagnosed.On [Mon 28 Dec 2016], a corpse of a 5-month puppy was brought to KVI and found positive for rabies. This dog, with a bandaged hind leg, was earlier detected while straying; the inspector brought the dog to a rabies-observation quarantine post where it died.An image of the dog is attached [in the original document], for those who had handled this dog to apply immediately to the closest health office for consultation, probably post-exposure treatment, and to detect and alert the dog's owners for similar procedure.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The original article includes a table showing the details of the 29 lab-confirmed rabies events recorded in Israel during 2016, involving 12 dogs (in 11 events), 2 (beef-type) cows, 3 (beef-type) calves, 1 horse, 5 jackals, and 7 foxes.A detailed table, including linked comments and a link to a video strip, is available at <http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/Vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim+kalevet/kalevet_2016/default.htm>. An English Google translation will help to decipher and use the information included, particularly the linked video strip presenting a bovine case (including the recorded typical mooing sound). Please note that the events 3, 8, 18, and 20 refer to jackals (Google translated as ""work""), and event 9 refers to a female calf (Google translated as ""wagon"").There are links to interactive and static rabies national 2016 maps. Most of the events are located along the Lebanese frontier; others adjacent to the southwest Syrian/north west Jordanian frontiers. Notably, rabid foxes were detected in the distant southern Arava (south Israel, adjacent to the border with south west Jordan).The 3rd linked map addresses the epidemiology of rabies in Israel during 2016, based upon genotyping. Of the 25 genotyped samples, 18 were variant V7 and 6 were variant V5, both genotypes in samples from the north. Interestingly, the foxes in the distant Arava region (southern Israel, bordering the Kingdom of Jordan) were caused by the genotyped variant V5, which has not been encountered in other regions. Its circulation in neighbouring Jordan deserves a visit.Oral vaccination of wildlife (foxes, possibly jackals), contributed to the control (essentially, total prevention) of rabies from most parts of Israel during the recent decade. It prevented the reintroduction of rabies into these regions, which were endemically rabies affected until the late 1990's. Rabies is endemic in all neighboring countries and particularly abundant in Syria and Lebanon. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/67>.]
