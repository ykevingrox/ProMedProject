There were only 3 cases last year, according to the NT [Northern Territory] Centre for Disease Control.All of those affected are indigenous people from the Central Australian, Barkly and Katherine communities, while 19 cases are kids younger than 10 [years of age].Northern Territory health authorities have mounted a large-scale immunisation campaign in the affected regions in an attempt to prevent it from spreading to the Top End. From this week, a free vaccine will be offered to all people aged between 12 months and 19 years living in remote communities, and all Aboriginal people aged between 12 months and 19 years living in Alice Springs, Tennant Creek and Katherine.The NT government is also coordinating with other jurisdictions after a spate of cases was reported on South Australia's traditional APY lands. [Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) is a large Aboriginal local government area located in South Australia. It consists of the Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra anangu (i.e. people), and has a population of around 2500 people (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anangu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara>). A map of the Australian state of South Australia showing the location of the APY Local Government Area is available at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anangu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara#/media/File:APY_LGA.png>. - Mod.ML]""This is a massive effort on the part of all the health services in the region and is focusing on those most at risk and those who are most likely to be carrying the germ in their nose or throat,"" CDC acting director Charles Douglas said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Katherine, with an urban population of 6094 in 2011, is a town in the Northern Territory (NT), Australia, 320 km (200 miles) southeast of Darwin, the capital and largest city in the NT (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine,_Northern_Territory>). The NT consists of 5 regions: Darwin, East Arnhem Land-Nhulunbuy, Katherine, Barkly, Central-Alice Springs (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_the_Northern_Territory>). The Barkly region, with an estimated population of 8168 people, is located south of Katherine, and its main town is Tennant Creek, with a population of 3062 residents (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennant_Creek>). The city of Alice Springs, with a population of 27 972, located in the Central Australia-Alice Springs region, is nearly equidistant from the cities of Adelaide and Darwin. A map of the NT regions can be found at <https://www.researchgate.net/figure/50251830_fig1_Figure-1-The-five-regions-of-the-Northern-Territory-highlighting-the-Alice-Springs>.The outbreak of meningococcal meningitis occurring in the NT is caused by serogroup W and is occurring mainly in Aboriginal children.ProMED-mail previously reported in May 2016 (Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg. B 20160515.4222568) that an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis in the state of South Australia was due to serogroup B in 10 of the 11 cases. This previous news report did not say where in South Australia the cases occurred or whether the cases were mainly Aboriginal children. However, the news report above says that the current outbreak in South Australia is localized to the APY Local Government Area, a region where Aboriginals reside. So the current infected individuals in South Australia presumably are Aboriginals, but we are not told what serogroup is now causing their infections. Is it serogroup B, like the outbreak that occurred in South Australia in 2016, or serogroup W, like the current outbreak in the NT?A quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccine is available through state-funded adolescent programs in 5 Australian states (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia) starting in 2017 for those aged 15-19 years or school years 10-12; however, in the NT and South Australia, a quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccine can only be obtained through private prescription (<http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf>). Presumably because of the outbreak due to meningococcal serogroup W in the NT, the vaccine now being offered in the NT without private prescription is a quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccine that will protect against the current outbreak serogroup W strain. The B vaccine has been made available through a statewide 2-year clinical study in South Australia since April 2017 for students enrolled in years 10, 11, and 12 in 2017 at participating schools (<http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf>).A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/292>. - Mod.ML]
