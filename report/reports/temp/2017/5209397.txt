Mekelle city health bureau chief Brikti Gebrekirstos said on [Tue 25 Jul 2017], the patients were infected with the disease after eating unhygienic food and using poor personal hygiene practices.Mekelle city health bureau has already dispatched health extension workers to teach the public on how to avoid practices that cause AWD. The city's health bureau has also closed down 3e restaurants that were deemed to be facilitating the diarrhea outbreak through unhygienic practices.Gebrekirstos further said the city has reserved a special ward in health centers for AWD sufferers and stocked on medicines to combat the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Several countries in East Africa use AWD as a euphemism for cholera. - Mod.LL]******[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Lagos State)Date: Tue 25 Jul 2017Source: The Nation [edited]<http://thenationonlineng.net/cholera-kills-two-lagos/>Lagos State Government confirmed on [Tue 25 Jul 2017], that 2 people have been killed in a new cholera outbreak in the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris, who disclosed this during chat with journalists, said the outbreak was caused by contamination of water sources with fecal matter from faulty septic tanks and soak-away following the heavy rainfall experienced recently in several parts of the state. Places affected by the outbreak are; Somolu, Oshodi-Isolo and Surulere local government areas of the state. Idris said: ""Following the heavy rainfall recently experienced and the aftermath flooding of some areas in the state, the ministry has been receiving notifications on upsurge of acute diarrhoea diseases in some local government areas.""""At least 27 cases have been line-listed by the Epidemiolgy/Disease Surveillance Officers in the state as at today [Tue 25 Jul 2017], regrettably 2 deaths were recorded from the 27 cases. A total of 6 cases were recorded in Somolu LGA, one of which died; 4 were managed at Somolu General Hospital, one was managed at a private hospital, another one was managed at Mainland Hospital, while one died at home. In Oshodi-Isolo LGA, 2 cases were recorded. One was managed at a private hospital and he is alive, while one died at home. As many as 14 cases were reported at Surulere LGA and managed at Randle General Hospital. No deaths have been recorded.""He said samples of well water were collected and sent to the Lagos State Drug Quality Control Laboratory. ""It has become necessary to remind the general public once again that acute diarrhea disease with or without vomiting is caused by a bacteria disease transmitted through ingestion of food or water contaminated with infective feces,"" the commissioner added. He urged the public to maintain hygienic conditions, adding that the government has instituted measures towards quick containment and control of the outbreak.[Byline: Miriam Ekene-Okoro]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - Kenya (Kisumu County), studentsDate: Wed 26 Jul 2017Source: All Africa, Daily Nation report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201707270785.html>A total of 2 school going children are the latest victims of the cholera outbreak that has hit Kisumu County. The 2, a 9-year-old girl and a boy, are admitted at Jaramogi Odinga Oginga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH). Currently, 28 patients are admitted at Kodiaga Hospital and Port Florence Hospital with cholera-like symptoms.Speaking during a press briefing JOOTRH medical superintendent Dr Juliana Otieno said the girl was brought to the hospital in critical condition. Kisumu County Executive for Health Dr Elizabeth Ogaja said that the school boy is admitted at a newly created centre where medics are dealing with cholera cases only. She said, due to the ongoing nurses' strike, the hospital has contracted a nurse to take care of cholera patients.Dr Ogaja said the county plans to review certification of food vendors within Kisumu as a measure to mitigate the outbreak.Meanwhile, the County Executive for Water Prof Barack Bonyo said the county government in partnership with UNESCO and Red Cross will dispatch chlorine tablets as a measure to sterilize water systems in the county. Prof Bonyo asked residents of Kisumu to sterilized water before use or buy water from authorized companies.[Byline: Elizabeth Ojina]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Cholera - Kenya (Kisumu County), prisonDate: Wed 26 Jul 2017Source: The Standard [edited]<https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001249175/fear-as-three-dead-33-treated-of-cholera>Panic has gripped Kisumu County and its environs after a cholera outbreak killed three people and left 35 admitted to hospital. Of those who succumbed, 2 were inmates at Kodiaga Maximum Security Prison while the 3rd one lived in Otongolo, a neighboring community.County health officials said they were battling the disease but feared it could get out of control because of the ongoing nurses' strike that has paralysed health services in public facilities.Yesterday [Tue 25 Jul 2017], Kisumu County Health Chief Officer Ojwang Lusi confirmed the cholera outbreak, adding that a team of public health officers had already been sent to the institution to contain the situation. ""Let the people of Kisumu know that there is a cholera outbreak and they must take precautionary measures to prevent its spread. There should, however, be no panic as we have the resources to handle the situation,"" said Dr Lusi. As of yesterday [Tue 25 Jul 2017], 21 inmates were admitted in isolation with cholera symptoms. Deputy Commissioner of Prisons in charge of Nyanza, Amos Misik, said the outbreak was discovered last [Thu 20 Jul 2017].[Byline: Kevine Omollo and Josphat Thiongo] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
