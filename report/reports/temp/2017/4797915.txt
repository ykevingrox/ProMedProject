DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.4.30447> [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22698> Since early [November 2016], the number of laboratory-confirmed norovirus infections reported in Germany has been increasing steeply. Here, we report the detection and genetic characterization of an emerging norovirus recombinant, GII.P16-GII.2. This strain was frequently identified as the cause of sporadic cases as well as outbreaks in 9 federal states of Germany. Our findings suggest that the emergence of GII.P16-GII.2 contributed to rising case numbers of norovirus gastroenteritis in Germany.In 2016, the increase of notified norovirus cases in the winter season was unexpectedly strong and early (Figure 1) in Germany. In [November 2016], 14 872 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported to the national public health authority compared with a median of 7810 cases in the same month of the previous 5 years. This may be due to a new variant's ability to escape herd immunity to the previously circulating strains. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the currently circulating norovirus strains in order to assess whether one or several new strains could be responsible for the current steep rise in norovirus cases.Discussion----------We found a new norovirus strain GII.P16-GII.2 in samples from sporadic AGE [acute gastroenteritis] and from norovirus outbreaks derived from 9 federal states of Germany. It was recently shown that the emergence of new GII.4 norovirus variants can result in an increasing number of reported norovirus infection [5]. This has already been observed in Germany in the season 2007-08 which was also characterized by an early rise and high total number of notified norovirus infections, with most of the analyzed outbreaks caused by the new epidemic variant GII.4 2006b [7]. Another example is the emergence of a novel variant GII.P17-GII.17 in the season 2014-15, which was 1st genotyped in China and Japan and replaced the previously dominant genotype GII.Pe-GII.4 2012 with an increased outbreak activity [8.9]. The new 2016 GII.P16-GII.2 recombinant has sporadically been reported to the international molecular surveillance database Noro Net from Australia, Finland, France and Russia, and previously from Japan and China [10.11], suggesting a worldwide distribution.So far, it is unclear whether the new recombinant is associated with more severe symptoms. Further molecular and epidemiological investigations are needed to assess whether the emerging new recombinant norovirus strain GII.P16-GII.2 can replace the predominant GII.Pe-GII.4 2012 strain and how this will affect outbreak sizes, course of disease and herd immunity of the population, not only in Germany but also in other countries in Europe.From: Sandra Niendorf <NiendorfS@rki.de> [edited]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
