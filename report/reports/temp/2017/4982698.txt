WAOW [edited]<http://www.waow.com/story/35137807/2017/04/Wednesday/health-department-investigating-food-poisoning-from-local-jimmy-johns>The Marathon County Health Department is investigating cases of food poisoning connected to a Jimmy John's restaurant in Weston. The Marathon County Health Department said the outbreak was due to norovirus. Members of the department tell Newsline 9 they've spoken with around 100 people who reported being sick. The department said it won't know exactly what caused the outbreak until a full report is complete. That is expected by June.""We have received some complaints and are doing follow-up,"" Health and safety director Dale Grosskurth said. ""It's a full investigation."" Grosskurth said the department 1st heard complaints on [Fri 7 Apr 2017]. He said they are speaking with customers to try and figure out how it happened. ""Find out what foods they ate, symptoms they experienced,"" he said. ""When did they eat? When did their symptoms start?""MB, a Weston resident, ordered from the restaurant on [Thu 6 Apr 2017] and said she felt sick the next morning. ""Violent vomiting and diarrhea for 4 hours,"" she said. ""I ordered the Italian number 9... I also had a few bites of the Turkey Tom with cheese.""Grosskurth said once the restaurant was told about the investigation, it closed its doors for cleaning and reopened hours later. ""Do the cleaning and disinfection,"" he said. ""Cooperated by getting rid of food that was prepared ahead of time.""The department didn't say how many people it believes could have been impacted and said the investigation could take weeks. ""We want to identify the factors that contributed to it. Whether it is the food, employee behavior or something else,"" he said. MB said doctors have now told her the food poisoning has led to an infection in her intestines. ""It's discouraging,"" she said. ""I just want to feel better.""The restaurant's franchise owner, Brian Macak, released the following statement: ""Food quality is our top priority and drives every decision we make. The Department of Health inspected our store following a handful of complaints about one delivery, but they found no food hygiene issues at the store. Regardless, we voluntarily closed our store for a few hours yesterday [Wed 11 Apr 2017] afternoon to deep clean all of the equipment... The Department of Health is continuing its investigation and we are working closely with them to provide any information required.""Grosskurth said the restaurant is safe to eat at.[Byline: Emily Thornton]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This significant outbreak of human norovirus infection has been linked to a single fast food restaurant in Marathon County, Wisconsin, which is located in the central part of the state and can be seen on a map at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_County,_Wisconsin> and at <http://geology.com/county-map/wisconsin-county-map.gif>.- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/250>.]
