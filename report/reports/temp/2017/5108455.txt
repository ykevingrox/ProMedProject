The Horse [edited]<http://www.thehorse.com/articles/39313/kentucky-confirms-first-equine-wnv-case-for-2017>The Kentucky State Veterinarian's office has announced that a horse from Bourbon County has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This is the 1st equine WNV case confirmed in the commonwealth this year. In a statement Kentucky Equine Programs manager E.S. ""Rusty"" Ford said the case was confirmed on [13 Jun 2017].The yearling Thoroughbred filly 1st showed signs of disease on [7 Jun 2017]. She was initially down, but able to rise with assistance; she also suffered muscle fasciculation (twitching) and seizures. By [7 Jun 2017] her condition had improved, and on [13 Jun 2017] the attending veterinarian reported the filly continued to show daily improvement. Ford's statement indicated that the filly had been vaccinated against WNV in 2016 and had received a booster on [1 Jun 2017].West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or ""just not with it""; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and ""spinal"" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.[Byline: Erica Larson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The dates given are a bit confusing. I suspect that this filly was first noted to be ill on [5 or 6 Jun 2017] but was showing signs of recovery by the [7 Jun 2017]. A strong anamnesic response should have kicked in by then. For the rest of you in the US & Canada it is late but not too late to get your horses vaccinated. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/220>.]
