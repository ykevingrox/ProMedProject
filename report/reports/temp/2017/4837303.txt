BioBioChile [in Spanish, trans.

The patient is currently in stable condition and under observation in order to see how she progresses clinically that, for now, has mainly shown symptoms similar to influenza,"" it was added.""As part of her treatment, she was given immune plasma developed by a team of specialists of the ClAå nica Alemana and the Universidad de Desarrollo. It is produced with the plasma of those who have survived the diseases and is given to patients in order to transfer antibodies to control the multiplication of the virus and neutralize its effects on the body,"" it was concluded.Up until now, this health institution has not specified the place where the youth was infected.In addition to this case, there are 2 youths 15 years of age who were infected with the virus after participating in a scout camp in mid-January [2017] in A'uble province [BAå o BAo region], and as a result, an epidemiological team with expertise is maintained in the San Carlos community. The health status of these [2] adolescents is critical, so for the past 24 hours the physicians decided to add to mechanical ventilation, ECMO [extra-corporeal oxygenation] that partially replaces the function of the heart and lungs.Dr Claudio Vargas, head of epidemiology of the Hospital of Emergency Public Assistance, ex Posta Central, stated that the 1st symptoms after having contracted the virus are fever, headache, and myalgia or muscle pain, followed by gastrointestinal problems and progressive respiratory difficulty.""Since the 1st symptoms are not specific, and produced by many illnesses such as influenza, it is important to be attentive to see if there has been exposure to risk factors: if the person has visited rural areas, been camping, etc."" stated the professional.He also stated that patients with confirmed infections must be hospitalized in facilities having intensive care beds and in many cases they will need to be helped with mechanical ventilation among other types of assistance, while the body combats the virus, since there is no specific treatment for the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Unfortunately the geographic area where the 13-year-old was infected is not specified, nor is there any description of the ecological setting where she might have encountered the virus. As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the BAå o BAo region where the 2 15 year olds became infected, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. Although there is little information about the circumstances under which the children acquired their hantavirus infections, it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in the environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>. - Mod.TY]******[2] National situationDate: Sat 11 Feb 2017Source: Cooperativa [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY and KS, edited]<http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/salud/hanta-gobierno-expresa-preocupacion-por-aumento-de-casos/2017-02-11/135247.html>In the BAo BAå o region, 2 new cases of hantavirus were detected, which increases to 21 cases of infection at the national level so far in 2017.To date, 5 deaths and 8 hospitalizations have been registered, among them 2 scouts who were infected while at a camp in San Carlos in the BAå o BAo region.The Subsecretary of Health, Jaime Burrows, expressed the government's concern for these cases and explained that, ""this is the season when cases increase. We have more cases than in the previous years and we must repeat the call [for alert].""""In our country, hantavirus infection is an endemic disease. It is present in the [Chile] continental territory from Valparaiso to the Aysen region and can affect people who work in rural areas as well as those participating in recreational activities in rural areas,"" he added. He also indicated that the increase in infections is due to climate change that brings along high temperatures and thus urged people to camp only in places without weeds or designated camp sites.Recommendations---------------""The most important thing is to never enter cabins that are abandoned and have not been ventilated; do not enter sheds, storehouses, or firewood storage buildings. Teach children and anyone walking in the woods to not enter shrubby areas,"" said Katia Abarca, infectious disease physician of the Catholic University.""It is always important to manage the garbage and food. Do not leave them within reach of mice. Leave the garbage far away from the tents,"" added the specialist.Fever, headache, upset stomach, nausea and vomiting are some of the symptoms the infected patients manifest in the 1st weeks of the infection. Anyone presenting with with these symptoms must go to the closest health assistance center for a diagnosis.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>
