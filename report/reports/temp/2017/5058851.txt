Medical Officer of Health Dr Patrick O'Connor says a patient was admitted to the hospital with a blood infection last week [week of Sun 14 may 2017], with results now confirming it is the disease. It is believed the child has family connections to the Auckland outbreak of typhoid in April 2017, which afflicted 18 people and caused one woman to die due to complications from it.""Since admission to hospital, the patient has been treated in isolation, and infection control processes are in place to prevent the spread of this infection,"" Dr O'Connor said. ""This has minimized the risk to other patients and to hospital staff.""People in close contact with the Palmerston North child were sampled over the weekend and one is being treated with antimicrobials.Dr O'Connor said the child attended an early childhood center and medical staff will work with the center on Wednesday and Thursday, 24-25 May 2017, to take samples from children and staff. ""It is important to understand that typhoid is spread by eating or drinking water that is contaminated with feces or urine from a person who has the illness, or who may be a carrier of the bacterium. Casual social contact such as visiting a person in hospital, or hugging and kissing them is not a significant risk to people,"" he said.Typhoid symptoms include a high fever developing over several days, as well as headaches, general weakness and muscle aches. Stomach pain and constipation are also common but some people get diarrhea.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Palmerston North (<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerston_North>) is a city located in the Manawatu-Whanganui region of the North Island of New Zealand, commonly referred to as Palmerston, or Palmy by locals. The initial outbreak of _S._ Typhi was in Aukland, on the north side of North Island.As noted, in the posting, there is a connection between at least one of the children and the cluster in Aukland. The infection is transmitted primarily from person-to-person via contaminated water or food rather than direct spread although the childcare setting is problematic. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1019>.]
