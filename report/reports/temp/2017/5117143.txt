The other 2 cases included an individual from Hufoof and an individual from Riyadh, both of whom were classified as primary cases but still under investigation for possible high risk exposures. In this same period there were 3 newly reported fatalities, 2 of whom were classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases in patients, associated with the nosocomial transmission in Riyadh. The 3rd fatality was reported from Hufoof in an individual with a history of direct exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.While it appears as though the nosocomial transmission cycles in Riyadh may be slowing down, it is too early to make definitive statements.Maps showing the locations within Saudi Arabia of the cases identified in the summary report above can be found at the source URLs.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
