A clinical isolate was initially identified as _Candida auris_ by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker MALDI Biotyper System), with a probability score ranging from 1.79B to 1.89B using the Research Use Only reference database. The isolate was forwarded to the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory for confirmation of identification. Analysis using ITS sequencing confirmed the identification. This patient was also infected with multiple carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs), namely NDM, VIM and OXA-48, along with VRE, and all appropriate infection control precautions were already in place. _C. auris_ was recovered from just one sample from this patient, which demonstrated polymicrobial growth. All the multidrug-resistant organisms identified were likely acquired in India._Candida auris_, a globally emerging multi-drug resistant yeast, was 1st identified in 2009 and has been associated with invasive infections, high mortality rates, and outbreaks in healthcare settings worldwide. _C. auris_ has been identified in 17 countries on 5 continents to date. _C. auris_ is difficult to identify in the laboratory, and antifungal agents commonly used to treat _Candida_ infections are not effective. It can also persist in the hospital environment with potential for transmission. Recently, the 1st case of multidrug resistant _C. auris_ in Canada was described in the Canada Communicable Disease Report (1). The isolate was recovered from the ear discharge of a 64-year-old patient; the individual had previously required prolonged hospitalization in India prior to accessing medical care in Canada.1.

Hoang, Roscoe, and Eckbo for the above submission.The following was extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Candida auris - UK: nosocomial, epidemiology 20170815.5252095:Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, nosocomial, multidrug resistant pathogen associated with a high mortality. Epidemiologic investigations in the U.S. reported above revealed most cases in each state had exposure to common healthcare facilities or had recently received healthcare in other countries and testing in these facilities identified widespread environmental _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms.Genotyping of isolates by whole genome sequencing indicated that isolates were highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia, but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the United States followed by local transmission within healthcare settings. On antifungal susceptibility testing at CDC, isolates were commonly resistant to fluconazole and many were also resistant to amphotericin B, but isolates were uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin) (3%).The U.S. CDC recommends that all _Candida_ isolates obtained from a normally sterile site (e.g., bloodstream) and from non-sterile sites, for example, when a patient is failing therapy for suspected _Candida_ infection at that site or during suspected _Candida_ outbreaks or epidemiological investigations, be identified to the species level. The Public Health England (PHE) has similar recommendations (<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/637685/Updated_Candida_auris_Guidance_v2.pdf>).However, commercially available biochemical-based tests used in many U.S. laboratories to identify fungi cannot differentiate _C. auris_ from related species, and _C. auris_ may be misidentified as _Candida haemulonii_ or reported as _Candida_ species. Some matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) devices and molecular methods based on sequencing the D1-D2 region of the 28s rDNA or the Internal Transcribed Region (ITS) of rDNA can identify _C. auris_; these tests may only be available at reference laboratories.The CDC and PHE encourages forwarding suspected _C. auris_ specimens to reference laboratories (CDC or state or regional public health laboratories in the U.S. or PHE Mycology Reference Laboratory in the UK) for further characterization. All confirmed isolates of _C. auris_ in the U.S. should be reported to local and state public health officials and to CDC at <candidaauris@cdc.gov> (<https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/candidiasis/recommendations.html>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/264>.][See Also:Candida auris - UK: nosocomial, epidemiology 20170815.5252095Candida auris - USA (04): nosocomial, epidemiology, drug resistance 20170520.5050111Candida auris - USA (03): (NY) fatality 20170430.5004770Candida auris - USA (02): (IL, NY) 20170429.5003259Candida auris - Panama: (Panama City) nosocomial 20170412.4966492Candida auris - USA 20170312.48957882016----Candida auris - Americas (02): USA, 1st isolates 20161105.4608846Candida auris - Americas: emerg, drug-resist, nosocom pathogen, PAHO/WHO, alert 20161005.4537152Candida auris: emerging, drug-resistant, nosocomial pathogen, alert 20160702.4322149].................................................ml/msp/lxl"
