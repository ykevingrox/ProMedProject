Novel Orthopoxvirus infection in an Alaska resident. Clin Infect Dis cix219. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix219.Abstract-------BackgroundHuman infection by orthopoxviruses is being reported with increasing frequency, attributed in part to the cessation of smallpox vaccination and concomitant waning of population-level immunity. In July 2015, a female resident of interior Alaska, presented to an urgent care clinic with a dermal lesion consistent with poxvirus infection. Laboratory testing of a virus isolated from the lesion confirmed infection by an Orthopoxvirus.MethodsThe virus isolate was characterized by using electron microscopy and nucleic acid sequencing. An epidemiologic investigation that included patient interviews, contact tracing and serum testing, as well as environmental and small mammal sampling was conducted to identify the infection source and possible additional cases.ResultsNeither signs of active infection nor evidence of recent prior infection were observed in any of the 4 patient contacts identified. The patient's infection source was not definitively identified. Potential routes of exposure included imported fomites from Azerbaijan by the patient's cohabiting partner, or from wild small mammals in or around the patient's residence. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the virus represents a distinct and previously undescribed genetic lineage of Orthopoxvirus, which is most closely related to the Old World orthopoxviruses.ConclusionsInvestigation findings point to infection of the patient following exposure in or near Fairbanks. This conclusion raises questions about the geographic origins (Old World versus North American) of the genus Orthopoxvirus. Clinicians should remain vigilant for signs of poxvirus infection and alert public health officials when cases are suspected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st Orthopoxvirus infection in humans in Alaska, USA that ProMED-mail has reported. The close relationship of this virus to Old World Orthopoxviruses raises the question of the origin of the Alaska virus. If fomites from Azerbaijan might have been the source of the virus, it would be of interest to know what those fomites were and if virus was recovered from that source. Fortunately, there was no transmission of the virus from the case to other people. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206>.].................................................dk/ty/ao/dk"
