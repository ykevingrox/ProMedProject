Department of Health and Human Services data shows the 654 cases diagnosed from 1-30 Jan this year [2017] is more than 20 times higher than the last outbreak in 2011. In the equivalent January period there were 32 notifications in 2011 with 1330 cases for the year. The average number of Ross River virus cases each year is 252.Victoria's chief health officer Professor Charles Guest has issued a warning for people to take extra care to protect themselves against Ross River, Barmah Forest virus and the potentially life-threatening Murray Valley encephalitis virus.""The number of Ross River virus notifications being made to the department this year-to-date is the largest that Victoria has seen compared to equivalent periods in the preceding 10 years,"" he said. ""Given the unprecedented number of notifications that have been made to the department so far this year, we expect that the magnitude of this year's [2017] outbreak will be larger than the outbreak observed in 2011. All parts of Victoria where there are mosquitoes may carry a risk for Ross River virus infection, although the risk is greatest in rural and regional Victoria,"" he said.Prof Guest said people bitten by an infected mosquito may experience joint swelling and pain, fatigue and muscle aches. It takes 3 to 9 days for symptoms of Ross River virus disease to occur after exposure, and sometimes up to 21 days, he said.Health Minister Jill Hennessy said heavy rainfall last year had created ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes, resulting in increasing reports of mosquito-borne illness.Tips to reduce the risk of being infected with mosquito-borne disease:- Wear long, loose fitting clothing because mosquitoes can bite through tight fitting clothing.- Use mosquito repellents on all exposed skin.- Install a flywire screen on all windows and self-closing wire screens on doors.- Remove stagnant water at least every week including from flower pots, tyres, buckets, tins, bird baths and pet bowls.- Empty children's wading pools when not being used and keep fishponds stocked with fish.- Mosquito nets or screens will help keep mosquitoes out of tents and added protection can be provided by treating the nets with an appropriate insecticide.- Limit outdoor activity at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active.[Byline: Bridie Byrne]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Ross River virus (RRV) infections occur sporadically across Australia, including Victoria state. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, than can persist for weeks making normal movement difficult.Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.A map of the state of Victoria, Australia can be seen at <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/?p=288>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/288>.]
