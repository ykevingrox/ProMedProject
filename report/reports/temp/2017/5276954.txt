Maine Public [edited] <http://mainepublic.org/post/rare-mosquito-borne-virus-reported-maine#stream/0>Two more cases of Jamestown Canyon virus have been identified in Maine. This is the 1st year that the mosquitoborne disease has been detected in the state, with a total of 3 cases so far. But state epidemiologist Dr Siiri Bennett says it's unclear whether the virus is more common, or it's been detected through better testing. ""We just have to be really cautious when there are mosquitoes are around,"" says Bennett. ""Use the insect repellant; cover up; make sure you are aware of what you can do to prevent bites.""Jamestown Canyon is an arboviral disease, as are West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis virus. They can cause flu-like symptoms as well as encephalitis and meningitis.Dr Bennett says Mainers should take precautions to prevent these Jamestown Canyon and other mosquitoborne diseases. ""Wear long sleeves, long trousers, use insect repellent,"" she says. ""Get rid of standing water on your property.""[byline: Patty Wight] --communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is active in Maine this year [2017], with the number of cases now coming to 3. According to an additional report from the Maine Center for Disease Control on 21 Aug 2017, one case is in Franklin County. The other is a New Hampshire resident. It's unclear if they were diagnosed in Maine (<http://www.wmtw.com/article/2-more-cases-of-rare-mosquito-borne-virus-reported-in-maine/12089635>). Interestingly, another case of Jamestown Canyon virus infection has been reported in Hanover, New Hampshire: this was reported on 18 Aug 2017 (see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA (02): (NH) 20170819.5261935).In July (2017), a Kennebec County, Maine man was hospitalized for the rare virus. The virus is endemic across the northern tier of states in the USA and probably in southern Canada as well. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit the virus. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_ are the principal amplification hosts.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/222>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/222>.]
