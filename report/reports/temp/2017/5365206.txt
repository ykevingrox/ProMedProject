Hospital sources said an alleged Congo virus affected patient, stated to be Afghan national, was shifted to Fatima Jinnah Hospital Quetta on [Wed 4 Oct 2017]. Despite all out efforts of the medics the Congo virus patient died on Thursday morning.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://pakistanmap.facts.co/pakistanmapof/PakistanAdministrativeMap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2343>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tickborne viral zoonosis in humans. The disease is sporadic and uncommon, but may have a severe clinical course with hemorrhagic manifestations.Domestic livestock are regarded as the main hosts of the disease and can transfer the disease during their viremic stage to humans. High-risk behaviors, such as slaughtering, animal handling, and/or examining livestock without wearing masks or gloves, and unauthorized slaughtering of animals, facilitate the transmission of the disease. In addition, healthcare workers are at risk of acquiring infection through the blood and bodily fluids of patients (Celikbas AK, Dokuzoguz B, Baykam N, et al. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever among health care workers, Turkey. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014; 20(3): 477-9; <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/3/13-1353_article>).The seroprevalence of CCHFV in people with a history of tick bites may be as high as 20 percent in endemic areas. Living in a rural area is a risk factor for exposure to the tick vector and for acquiring CCHFV infection. However, because markets for animal trading are typically located near large cities, CCHFV seroprevalence is also higher among people living in urban areas than people living in rural areas.The report above mentions that the case was suspected to have CCHF infection, but does not mention, whether it was lab confirmed or not. Any further information in this regard will be highly appreciated. The reliable and quick diagnosis for CCHF is generally based on molecular assays, such as PCR or real time PCR tests. - Mod.UBA]
