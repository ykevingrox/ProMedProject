9 News, Australian Associated Press (AAP) report [edited]<http://www.9news.com.au/health/2017/04/12/15/53/legionnaires-outbreak-in-melbourne>A total of 89 water systems and 3 buildings in Melbourne's CBD [central business district] are being disinfected following a legionnaire's disease outbreak that has hospitalised 5 people.Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services is also investigating a possible 3 further cases.Deputy Chief Health Officer Finn Romanes has described the numbers affected as ""unusual"" in a short time frame.In the 5 confirmed cases, the 3 men and 2 women, aged 51 to 71, had each reported working in or visiting Melbourne's CBD in the days before they became ill.	DHHS has investigated a 500 m [0.3 mi] radius from the corner of Little Bourke and Russell streets as the area of concern, with the water systems and cooling towers being decontaminated from the area east of Elizabeth Street to Spring Street.Dr Romanes told reporters on [Wed 12 Apr 2017] that although all 5 patients had been hospitalised, they were now recovering after treatment with antibiotics. He says it is ""safe and appropriate"" for people to enter Melbourne's CBD for work and leisure, but advises anyone with flu or pneumonia-like symptoms who has been in the city centre from the end of March [2017] to the beginning of April [2017] to see their GP.Legionnaire's disease causes flu-like symptoms such as headaches, sore muscles, fever, and chills followed by respiratory problems and pneumonia. It is fatal in up to 10 per cent of cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Melbourne, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in Australia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne>).

The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source and genotyping environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can point to the possible source for those patients if the genotypes match. - Mod.ML]
