There are 3 sub-classifications for paralytic polio disease related to infection with vaccine derived poliovirus. The 1st type is related to circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). This type occurs in areas where the vaccination coverage of the population is low and the attenuated vaccine virus (contained in the oral poliovirus vaccine - OPV) starts circulating among the susceptibles for a prolonged period (12-18 months) and during this process the vaccine virus reverts to a virus with increased neurovirulence leading to cases of paralytic disease caused by the cVDPV. Identification of cVDPVs leads to the same response as identification of wild polioviruses (WPVs).The 2nd type of VDPV is that seen when immunodeficient individuals are exposed to the vaccine virus and are unable to clear the infection so they become chronic excreters of the vaccine. These viruses are referred to as iVDPV.The 3rd type is referred to as ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPV) and these are VDPVs that do not fit under the other 2 categories. The significance of the VDPVs is that as transmission of the WPVs is interrupted, the remaining polioviruses in circulation will be the VDPVs and may lead to continued outbreaks of polio due to the cVDPV.Mozambique was certified as polio free in July 2016. A media report from Mozambique in January 2017 mentioned a case had been identified in November 2016 and an emergency campaign was being held in February 2017 focusing on the Zambezi area where the case was identified. (<http://clubofmozambique.com/news/emergency-polio-vaccination-lower-zambezi-mozambique/>). Another media report mentioned the case had been identified in January 2017 (<http://apanews.net/en/news/mozambique-launches-polio-vaccination-exercise>). One wonders if this might be the case referred to as having been identified as a VDPV.The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been identified as a concern location at risk of polio transmission due to low vaccination coverages. A recent ReliefWeb post mentions the confirmation of a case of polio in Butumba, Bukama Territory [Haut Katanga province], and another suspected case in Malemba [Bas-UÌ©lÌ© province]. (<http://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-weekly-humanitarian-update-15-21-may-2017>). Again, one wonders if this might be the case referred to as having been identified as a VDPV (and quite possibly a cVDPV).More information on these reports of polio cases would be greatly appreciated. Were VDPVs identified? If yes, were they further classified as cVDPVs? And further information from the epidemiologic investigations of these cases would be greatly appreciated.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Mozambique can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/177>.The HealthMap/ProMED map of the Democratic Republic of the Congo can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42129>.Selected references-------------------1.
