Daily Sabah [edited]<https://www.dailysabah.com/health/2017/05/01/turkey-to-produce-worlds-first-crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever-vaccine>The Turkish health minister, Recep AkdaÙ, stated on [Mon 1 May 2017] that Turkey will produce the 1st-ever vaccine against Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Speaking during a visit to the central Anatolian city of Kayseri, AkdaÙ said that the Turkish Health Ministry is developing the vaccine in coordination with Kayseri's Erciyes University.""Turkish scientists have been working day and night to develop the vaccine. We as the ministry have provided the necessary support to them. The vaccine has been studied, and Turkey is now able to produce the 1st-ever vaccine against the disease,"" he said. ""We will produce an original vaccine, not a licensed one belonging to a pharmaceutical company. We need a little more time until the research is completely carried out and the vaccine is released,"" AkdaÙ added.Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent.CCHF is widespread across Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north -- the geographical limit of the principal tick vector.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[""Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe tickborne disease, endemic in many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Asia. Between 15-70 per cent of reported cases are fatal. There is no approved vaccine available, and preclinical protection in vivo by an experimental vaccines has not been demonstrated previously. In a study by Buttigieg et al in 2014, modified vaccinia virus Ankara, was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the CCHF virus glycoproteins. Cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in 2 mouse strains, including type I interferon receptor knockout mice, which are susceptible to CCHF disease. This vaccine protected all recipient animals from lethal disease in a challenge model adapted to represent infection via a tick bite."" [1]Most clinical CCHF immunity studies have examined serum antibody levels against the nucleoprotein. [2] Patients with a fatal outcome have a weak or absent antibody response, and Ozturk et al found significant differences between IgM and IgG levels in fatal vs. non-fatal cases. [3] However, other studies were unable to find a significant relationship between the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies and clinical outcome, but found that viral load was a better predictor of prognosis. [4] Virus titres decreased in survivors during the first week of disease, independently of antibodies, suggesting a critical role of innate or cellular immune mechanisms. [5]The above report does not specify the nature of the vaccine and actual stage of development and whether clinical trials or production will be initiated soon. - Mod.UBAReferences----------1.
