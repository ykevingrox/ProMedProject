Norwalk (CT) Daily Voice [edited]<http://norwalk.dailyvoice.com/news/population-of-lone-star-ticks-found-on-norwalks-manresa-island/722108/>There is a new tick to worry about in Connecticut: a sizable population of a species that has been linked to an allergy to red meat in humans has been discovered on an island in Norwalk, state environmental officials said. The presence of the lone star ticks was detected in June 2017 after a South Norwalk resident reported a deer acting strangely on Manresa Island, according to a release from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.DEEP [Department of Energy & Environmental Protection] Environmental Conservation Officer Jesse Nivolo found the deer -- which was dead and had a severe infestation of ticks that covered its eyes, ears, head, and neck. Researchers from the Agricultural Experiment Station went to Manresa Island and found multiple deer and raccoon skeletons and many dead birds, according to a state official.""The number of ticks on and around the animal was incredible,"" said Dr Kirby Stafford of CAES [Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station]. ""A population of this size has been established, unreported for many years."" They found that the lone star tick was ""incredibly abundant"" at the site, but did not appear to be established on the mainland.Manresa Island is not open to the public and poses little direct threat to residents, DEEP said. But more and more lone star ticks are being submitted by local residents for testing, sad the Norwalk Health Department, suggesting that the ticks were being introduced to other areas in town.There has also been a steady increase in submissions of lone star ticks to the CAES Tick Testing Laboratory, with 70 to 90 in recent years. The majority of lone star tick submissions are from lower Fairfield County.The lone star tick is the most common human-biting tick in the southeastern USA. Lone star ticks are reddish brown in color, with white spot on the back of female ticks. Male ticks have faint white markings at the edge of the body. The lone star tick is associated with a number of human and animal diseases such as ehrlichiosis, Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), spotted fever rickettsiosis, tularemia, Heartland virus, theileriosis in deer (related to human babesiosis), and more recently, red meat allergy.Lone star ticks do not transmit the pathogens that cause Lyme disease, babesiosis, or anaplasmosis.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As noted, this is not the 1st recognition of the lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_) in Connecticut and the tick has been recognized throughout New England including Maine (ProMED post Lone star tick - USA: New England 20060724.2038). It is able to transmit a number of infections to man as well as inducing red meat allergy.One relevant study was published in 2011: Commins SP, James HR, Kelly LA, et al. The relevance of tick bites to the production of IgE antibodies to the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose. J Allerg Clin Immunol. 2011; 127: 1286-93. The abstract can be found in ProMED-mail Lone star tick - USA: link to meat allergy 20120623.1178567.It has been known for several decades that an immunological reaction occurs to tick salivary antigens in animals fed on by the tick. Indeed, a large amount of research has been published regarding the protection of humans and animals from tick-borne diseases by immunization with tick antigens which may block the ability of the tick to transmit infection (for a review, see Lee R, Opdebeeck JP: Arthropod vaccines, in New Vaccines and new vaccine technologies, Lutwick LI (ed), Infect Dis N Am 1999; 13: 209-26).This study came about related to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, which is specific for epidermal growth factor receptor, and was approved for use in treating cancer in 2005. Subsequently, it became clear that a significant number of treated patients were experiencing severe hypersensitivity reactions during their 1st infusion of this monoclonal antibody. Those reports appeared to be restricted to an area of the southeastern USA, including Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas, Virginia, and the southern half of Missouri. In 2007, a detailed investigation of serum antibodies established that these reactions were occurring in patients who had preexisting IgE antibodies specific for the glycosylation on the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody. The relevant oligosaccharide was found to be galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), which is a blood group substance of nonprimate mammals.Of note, the known distribution of the immediate reactions to cetuximab was similar to the areas with high prevalence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and human ehrlichiosis. The authors of the paper became aware of patients who thought that reactions to red meat started after receiving multiple tick bites, and were informed that several allergists had reported to their local allergy meetings about patients who had become allergic to meat after experiencing multiple tick bites.Diseases linked to _A. americanum_ include ehrlichiosis, tularemia, STARI (Southern tick-associated rash illness, <http://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/>) and the Heartland virus. Pictures of the lone star tick, including one of engorging female _A. americanum_ ticks, can be found at <http://www.tickinfo.com/lonestartick.htm>.It is increasingly clear that the same delayed (3-6 hours) IgE mediated hypersensitivity from meat can be associated with other ticks such as _Ixodes holocyclus_ in Australia (1) and _I. ricinus_ in Sweden (2) and Spain (3); and not only can beef be an issue, but also lamb, pork and game (1). Additionally, alpha-gal has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract of ticks (2). The curious delayed nature of a usually rapid onset immune reaction may be explained by the slower absorption of the alpha-gal expressing glycoproteins transported with dietary triglycerides (4).References----------1.
