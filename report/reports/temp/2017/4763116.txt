The 1st cases were reported in 2016, week 46 [week ending 18 Nov 2016], with an increasing number of infections. Most infections have been reported in MSM (men who have sex with men) in the age group 20 to 46. Our own laboratory reported 3 cases in the last 2 days (10 and 11 Jan 2017) to the local public health department.Links to the reports of the local public health department:<http://www.berlin.de/lageso/_assets/gesundheit/publikationen/berlin_ewb_2016_51-52-2016-publ.pdf> [weeks 51 and 52 2016; in German, dated 4 Jan 2017] and<http://www.berlin.de/lageso/_assets/gesundheit/publikationen/berlin_ewb_2016_50-publ.pdf> [week 50 2016; in German, dated 21 Dec 2016] --Martin ObermeierMedizinisches Infektiologiezentrum BerlinGermany<obermeier@mvz-mib.de>[ProMED thanks Dr Obermeier for this posting.Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al: Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at <http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract>), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area, at least since July 2008, involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from ACIP are:Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and persons with any of the following indications:- men who have sex with men;- persons who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs;- persons working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;- persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates;- persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and- unvaccinated persons who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5857>.][See Also:2016----Hepatitis A - Netherlands: (Amsterdam) school 20161104.4607009Hepatitis A - UK: (Wales) school children-related 20160707.4330784Hepatitis A - Mexico: (SI) children, RFI 20160706.4328715Hepatitis A - Taiwan: increased MSM incidence 20160518.42301112015----Hepatitis A - New Zealand: Chinese frozen berries, alert, recall 20151206.3843919Hepatitis A - Lebanon 20150423.3317814Hepatitis A - Belize: (CY) school 20150128.31263842012----Hepatitis A - Honduras: (Tegucigalpa) school children 20120828.1268317Hepatitis A - Mexico (02): (MC) school children 20120209.1037612Hepatitis A - Mexico: (MC) school children 20120208.10362462009----Hepatitis A - Spain: (Barcelona), MSM 20090416.1445].................................................ll/mj/je/dk"
