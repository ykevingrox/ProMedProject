Dutch News [edited]<http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/09/almost-100-tiger-mosquitoes-caught-in-gelderland-village-no-reason-for-panic/>Inspectors from the Dutch product safety board [NWVA] have found 98 tiger mosquitoes, including larvae and pupae in and around the Gelderland village of Aalten, local broadcaster Omroep Gelderland said on Tuesday [5 Sep 2017].Locals were warned 2 weeks ago to keep an eye out for the Asian insects, which have distinctive black and white stripes.The NWVA drew up a plan to eradicate the Aalten mosquitoes, which carry diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever in their native habitat. They were 1st sighted in the Netherlands in 2005.The NVWA said there was a negligible chance of humans being infected but is taking action to prevent the insects colonizing the Netherlands. Since the turn of the century, the species has succeeded in establishing itself in several southern European countries, including France and Italy.The large number of mosquitoes found near Aalten are ""no reason for panic"" the NVWA said. The mosquito is thought to have arrived in the Netherlands in imported car tires and bamboo plants.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is not the 1st time that invasive mosquitoes, including _Aedes albopictus_, have been found in the Netherlands. In 2016, 3 _Ae. aegypt_ were captured in the Schiphol Airport. In the Netherlands in 2010, adults and larvae of the Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_], the American rock pool mosquito [probably _Aedes (reclassified as _Ochlerotatus_) atropalpus_], and the yellow fever mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_] were found in used tires imported by several different companies in the region.Because _Ae. aegypti_ is a tropical and sub-tropical mosquito, it cannot become established in the Netherlands. _Aedes albopictus_ can go into diapause and survive the winter. However, aggressive vector control by NWVA will doubtless be successful in eliminating the _Aedes albopictus_ in Aalten.A map of the distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypti_ in Europe can be accessed at <https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/disease-vectors/surveillance-and-disease-data/mosquito-maps>.Photographs of _Aedes albopictus_ can be seen at <https://www.themontserratreporter.com/new-zika-alert-beware-the-asian-tiger-mosquito-2/> and _Ae. aegypti_ at <http://www.contracostamosquito.com/aegypti_mosquito.htm>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of the Netherlands can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/104>, and Gelderland Province at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10617>.]
