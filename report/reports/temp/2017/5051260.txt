Bio Bio Chile [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://tinyurl.com/n47ky26>A 67-year-old man from the Puyehue community in Osorno province [Los Lagos region], was taken to the after having had health problems on Thursday afternoon [18 May 2017].Various signs of illness led the family of the affected individual to accompany him to the health facility in Entre Lagos, where it was determined by rapid test that the symptoms corresponded to a hantavirus infection, a hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome that is transmitted from the long-tailed rat to humans.Luis Scholz Villanueva, the Medical Subdirector of the local hospital center, indicated that [the diagnosis] was corroborated in the emergency department of the San Jose Hospital of Osorno from where the patient was referred to the ConcepciÌ n Regional Hospital.[The patient's] transportation was carried out at dawn in an ambulance of the Emergency Medical Attention Service, under coordination of the ministry [local ministerial health unit -- Health SEREMI?], which determined that the ConcepciÌ n Hospital had the equipment necessary to counteract the effects of the hantavirus [infection] in the 67 year old man.It has been stated that from the activity carried out by the man, he would have been in a storage area in his domicile, predicting that the focus of infection would have been there. Although initially his condition was stable, during the trip it would have worsened.To date, the Los Lagos region has had a total of 13 confirmed cases of [a] hantavirus infection, of which 4 are from the Osorno province and 3 people have died in the region, numbers that increase concern in comparison to 2016, when 8 confirmed cases of the infection were registered with 0 percent mortality.This new case occurs at a time when the Provincial Secretariat of the Regional Ministry of Health is concerned about the increase in the population of rodents detected in the region through community complaints in some sectors, associated -- according to experts -- to the seed setting this year [2017] of the _Chusquea montana_ [a type of bamboo] that blooms at an altitude over 700 meters [2300 ft] and is present in areas of the Los Lagos region.[Byline: Carina Almarza, Eduardo Palacios]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The numbers of cases of hantavirus infections in Los Lagos region continues to increase this year (2017). Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. When seeds of the Chusquea cane are abundant, populations of this rodent increase due to more available food.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/30531>. - Mod.TY]
