Anadolu Agency [edited]<http://aa.com.tr/en/health/2-134-yemenis-killed-by-cholera-who/925742>The WHO has recorded at least 2134 cholera-related deaths in war-torn Yemen since April 2017. In a statement on [Tue 3 Oct 2017], the WHO said a whopping 777 229 suspected cases of cholera have been registered in the country over the past months.The UN agency said the northwestern Hajjah province has recorded the highest death toll, almost 400 fatalities, while Socotra province, a small 4-island archipelago in the Arabian Sea, was the only part the country that remained unaffected by the epidemic.Yemen has remained dogged by violence since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country. The conflict escalated in 2015 when Saudi Arabia launched an air campaign aimed at rolling back Houthi gains. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, more than 3 million Yemenis have fled their homes since the conflict began, while more than 20 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.[Byline: Mohammed al-Samei]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The continuing statistics of this record epidemic of _V. cholerae_ in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2514 May / 11 000 / 18021 May / 29 300 / 31527 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5326 Jun / 96 000 / 74614 Jun / 140 116 / 98921 Jun / 179 548 / 120528 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15007 Jul / 297 438 / 170613 Jul / 332 600 / 175920 Jul / 368 207 / 182829 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199725 Aug / 565 041 / 201830 Aug / 591 100 / 20358 Sep / 635 752 / 206217 Sep / 686 783 / 209020 Sep / 704 454 / 210324 Sep / 738 212 / 211727 Sep / 753 098 / 212229 Sep / 767 524 / 21272 Oct / 777 229 / 2134In 2015 <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries. In 2016 <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/258910/1/WER9236.pdf>, the total number of cases was 132 121 from 38 countries.This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only 21 weeks old and is 5.9 times the total number of global cases of 2016 and 2.28 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.27 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. As noted, there are now more cases in less than 6 months than the 1st over 5 years of the Haitian cholera disaster. As estimates here have been suggesting for some time, the total will likely break one million by 2017's end.Of note, today, 3 Oct 2017, WHO has published ""Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030"" written by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control. The summary is reproduced below (<http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap-summary.pdf?ua=1>) and the entire document can be found at: <http://www.who.int/cholera/publications/global-roadmap.pdf?ua=1>.""Ending Cholera--A Global Roadmap to 2030 operationalises the new global strategy for cholera control at the country level and provides a concrete path toward a world in which cholera is no longer a threat to public health. By implementing the strategy between now and 2030, the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) partners will support countries to reduce cholera deaths by 90 percent. With the commitment of cholera-affected countries, technical partners, and donors, as many as 20 countries could eliminate disease transmission by 2030. ""Cholera is a disease of inequity--an ancient illness that today sickens and kills only the poorest and most vulnerable people. The map of cholera is essentially the same as a map of extreme poverty. Yet every death from cholera is preventable with the tools we have today, putting the goal of ending its public health impact within our reach. Cholera can be controlled with a multi-sectoral approach-- including basic water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, and oral cholera vaccines (OCV). Ending cholera is a moral obligation and an important achievement in its own right and it is also critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). If we fail to act, climate change, urbanization, and population growth will create an increased risk of cholera in the coming years.""In 2017, cholera continues to hit communities already made vulnerable by tragedies such as conflicts and famines. Yemen currently faces the world's largest cholera outbreak, with over 700 000 suspected cases and more than 2 000 deaths reported since April [2017]. Over 800 people have died of cholera in Somalia since the beginning of the year, and over 500 in the DRC. Haiti has now reported nearly 1 million cases and 10 000 deaths since the beginning of the 2010 outbreak.""The strategy focuses on the 47 countries affected by cholera today, and consists of multi-sectoral interventions supported by a nimble and effective coordination mechanism. The Global Roadmap focuses on 3 strategic axes: 1. ""Early detection and quick response to contain outbreaks: the strategy focuses on containing outbreaks--wherever they may occur-- through early detection and rapid response, which are critical elements for reducing the global burden of cholera. Through interventions like robust community engagement, strengthening early warning surveillance and laboratory capacities, health systems and supply readiness, and establishing rapid response teams, we can drastically reduce the number of deaths from cholera even in fragile settings.2. ""A targeted multi-sectoral approach to prevent cholera recurrence: the strategy also calls on countries and partners to focus on cholera ""hotspots"", the relatively small areas most heavily affected by cholera, which experience cases on an ongoing or seasonal basis and play an important role in the spread of cholera to other regions and areas. Cholera transmission can be stopped in these areas through measures including improved WASH and through use of OCV. In Africa alone, 40 to 80 million people live in cholera hotspots.3. ""An effective mechanism of coordination for technical support, advocacy, resource mobilisation, and partnership at local and global levels: the GTFCC provides a strong framework to support countries in intensifying efforts to control cholera, building upon country-led cross-sectoral cholera control programs, and supporting them through human, technical, and financial resources. As a global network of organisations, the GTFCC is positioned to bring together partners from across all sectors, and offers an effective country-driven platform to support advocacy and communications, fundraising, intersectoral coordination, and technical assistance.""- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
