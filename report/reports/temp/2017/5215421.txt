Salt Lake Tribune [edited]<http://www.sltrib.com/home/5505859-155/livestock-blamed-for-e-coli-outbreak>Infected animals are the likely cause of an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak that killed 2 children and sickened 10 others recently in Hildale, Utah and adjoining Arizona communities, health officials said on Fri 28 Jul 2017.The news release from the Southwest Utah Public Health Department referred to the animals as ""livestock,"" but did not provide further description. While livestock were likely the source, person-to-person contact spreads the bacterium, the news release said.David Heaton, a spokesman for the health department, said in an email that the animals in question were ""in a contained area."" The owners have been instructed on how to manage the animals to prevent further infection, Heaton wrote._E. coli_ is a bacterium normally found in the intestinal tracts of animals such as cows, sheep and goats, all of which can be found in backyard pens throughout Hildale and Colorado City and Centennial Park, Ariz. A CDC webpage says that those animals can shed the bacterium in their waste and transfer _E. coli_ to humans. Contaminated food, such as undercooked ground beef or unpasteurized milk, also can spread _E. coli_. The news release from the Southwest Utah Public Health Department said water sources, ground beef, dairy products and produce in the towns all tested negative for _E. coli_.[Byline: Nate Carlisle]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Cattle specifically are the primary sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ to humans. Other animals may carry the toxigenic bacterial strains, but the more liquid nature of bovine feces (""cow pies"") facilitates contamination of the environment and the animals themselves.Although classically associated with undercooked ground beef, the organisms can be acquired by ingestion of contaminated produce such as sprouts, salad greens and tomatoes, which can be contaminated anywhere along the food chain from the field to the kitchen. Other methods of acquisition include contamination of community water supplies as well as recreational water and direct exposure to infected animals and their environment such as in a petting zoo.It is not stated what the livestock exposure was thought to be, but some of the cases appear to be child-to-child transmission, which occurs commonly in a household or day care setting. - Mod.LLProMED HealthMaps:Utah: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/246>Arizona: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/207>]
