In this currently update, there were 3 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 9 days, 1 each from Najran, Madinah, and Makkah. During this slowdown, the MOH has not been posting daily reports, with the presumption on my part that the missing days were days with no newly confirmed cases nor reports of deaths nor recoveries. That being said, the numbers I have on the total number of currently active cases, fatalities and recoveries differs from those maintained on the Saudi MOH.Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases, reported fatalities and recoveries can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia - WHO update 10 Feb 2017Date: Fri 10 Feb 2017Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/10-february-2017-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 10 Feb 2017----------------------------------------------------------------------Between 10 Jan 2017 and 3 Feb 2017 the National International Health Regulations Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 17 additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) including 4 fatal cases. 3 deaths among previously reported MERS cases (case no. 1 and 2 in DON published on 26 January 2017 and case no. 6 in DON published on 17 Jan 2017) were also reported.Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below).
