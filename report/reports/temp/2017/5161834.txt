The doctors are still waiting for test reports before they can confirm whether the new victim has rabies,"" Rohani told reporters here Saturday [8 Jul 2017].She added that the health condition of the 7-year-old victim from Kampung Lebor, Gedong has yet to improve and that she was still under strict observation at the ICU.Two other rabies victims -- a 6-year-old girl and her 4-year-old brother from Kampung Paon, Sungai Rimu, in Serian -- died from the disease on Tuesday [6 Jul 2017].The Sarawak Veterinary Services Department on Friday [7 Jul 2017] said that 771 cats and dogs have been checked at the 5 villages declared rabies-infected, including Kampung Krait, Kampung Paon Rimu Bakung and Kampung Remun in Serian.A total of 690 animals have been vaccinated, while samples of 21 others have been sent to the Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh, Perak.[Byline: Geryl Ogilvy]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[The East Malaysian public's concern and the authorities' strong response deserve to be seen against the background of rabies' absence from this territory for decades. The tragic event seems to have caught both the public and the government by surprise.In fact, until recently, Malaysia was counted among the only 4 Asian countries regarded canine rabies-free (the others are Japan, Singapore and South Korea; ref. 1). Malaysia lost its rabies-free status in 2015, when rabid dogs were reported from north peninsular Malaysia (areas bordering Thailand). There were human exposures with timely PEP treatment. The current event is different: the victims sought treatment when already in their clinical phase.East Malaysia is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the South China Sea, and there is a long distance (some 750 km) between Serian and the closest shore of Peninsular Malaysia; see map at <http://tinyurl.com/yaxscb2x>).According to earlier reports, urine samples, saliva, and skin biopsies of the 1st 3 patients (of whom 2 have already died) were sent to the Institute of Medical Research in Kuala Lumpur, where they tested positive for rabies virus. The application of such diagnostic methods has been recently assessed in another Asian country (Ref 2).Those interested in the history of rabies in (Peninsular) Malaysia are referred to Ref. 3.References1.
