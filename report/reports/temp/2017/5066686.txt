Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/05/hospital-outbreak-mcr-1-klebsiella-reported-china>Chinese scientists are reporting a deadly outbreak of MCR-1-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ among pediatric leukemia patients in China, apparently the 1st reported hospital outbreak involving the colistin-resistance gene [1].In a letter published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers say clinical isolates--including 1 _Escherichia coli_ and 5 _K. pneumoniae_--from 6 patients with pneumonia admitted to a pediatric leukemia ward in Guangzhou, China, were found to harbor the colistin-resistance gene. The isolates were collected from January 2015 through January 2016.In addition to colistin, which is considered a last-resort antibiotic, the 6 isolates were resistant to several other antibiotics, including polymixin B, cefotaxime, and gentamicin. The 5 _K. pneumoniae_ isolates were additionally resistant to ceftazidime, cefepime, amikacin, fosfomycin, and ciprofloxacin.The patients were treated with combinations of several different antibiotics, including vancomycin, lincomycin, imipenem, and cefotaxime. Two of the patients, who ranged from 2 to 6-years-old, died from their infection. The others recovered.Genetic testing revealed that all 5 of the _K pneumoniae_ isolates were clonally related and belonged to the sequence type ST11, while the _E coli_ isolate belonged to ST156. In all of the isolates, MCR-1 was found to be located on transferable plasmids. These small, floating pieces of DNA can transfer resistance genes to different types of bacteria. The isolates were found to carry a variety of resistance genes.""In conclusion, we identified a hospital outbreak of an MCR-1-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST11 strain among children with acute leukaemia,"" the authors write. ""Our finding suggests that MCR-1 can spread in the hospital environment in the absence of colistin use.""The letter comes from the same research team that initially identified the MCR-1 gene in _E. coli_ samples from pigs, pork products, and humans in China in 2015 [see <http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00424-7/fulltext>]. The detection of the plasmid-mediated gene, which was thought to be a product of widespread colistin use in Chinese agriculture, raised concern about the potential for the emergence of multidrug-resistant ""superbugs"" that are essentially untreatable with current antibiotics. China banned use of the drug in animal feed in 2016, based in part on the findings of that study.In January of this year [2017], the team reported in The Lancet Infectious Diseases that MCR-1 had been detected in _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_ isolates collected at 2 hospitals in China's Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces from 2007 through 2015 [2]. Although the prevalence of the gene was low, the findings documented the spread of MCR-1 to the clinical setting in China. Chinese hospitals did not use colistin in patients until this year [2017].Timothy Walsh, DSc, lead author of that study and a professor at Cardiff University in Wales, said at the time that he was concerned that clinical use of colistin in China would lead to more colistin-resistant infections in humans. ""The spread of colistin-resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,"" he said in a press release. (Walsh is a co-author on the current study.)Since MCR-1 was 1st identified, it has been detected in isolates from animals, food products, and humans in more than 30 countries, including the United States. Although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not comment on whether this is the 1st reported MCR-1 hospital outbreak, the agency said in an e-mail, ""The mcr-1 gene vividly illustrates the many domestic and global challenges facing us as we work to contain the spread of antibiotic resistance and improve antibiotic use.""[Byline: Chris Dall][1.

Here we report a hospital outbreak of the MCR-1-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_.""A total of 6 clinical isolates including 1 _Escherichia coli_ and 5 _K. pneumoniae_ were identified from 6 patients with pneumonia admitted to a paediatric leukaemia ward at a hospital in Guangzhou, China, during 2 months between December, 2015, and January, 2016. These patients were treated with different combinations of vancomycin, imipenem, lincomycin, cefotaxime, and caspofungin acetate. Two of the 6 patients died from their infections.""All 6 isolates were resistant to colistin, polymyxin B, cefotaxime, and gentamicin; and the 5 _K. pneumoniae_ isolates were additionally resistant to ceftazidime, cefepime, amikacin, fosfomycin, and ciprofloxacin. Various resistance genes were identified by PCR and sequencing in these isolates, including mcr-1, blaTEM-1, bla(CTX-M-3), aac(3)-IIa, aph(3')-Ia, fosA3 in _E. coli_ and mcr-1, blaTEM-1, blaSHV-11, blaCTX-M-3, aac(3)-IVa, aphA6, armA, fosA3, qnrB4, and qnrS1 in _K. pneumoniae_ (appendix).2""All 6 isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).1 As a result, 5 mcr-1-positive _K. pneumonia_ isolates were identified as ST11, and the mcr-1-positive _E. coli_ from patient one belonged to ST156. Results of PFGE were consistent with MLST and indicated that the 5 _K. pneumoniae_ were clonally related. Colistin resistance was successfully transferred to _E. coli_ C600 with high conjugation frequencies (10^-1 to 10^-2) in all isolates, suggesting that mcr-1 was located on transferable plasmids. The results of S1-PFGE and plasmid replicon typing for mcr-1-carrying plasmid in the transconjugants showed that mcr-1 was located at IncX4 plasmids of approximately 50 kb in size in all 6 isolates, which harboured blaTEM-1 and blaCTX-M-3 (appendix).""In conclusion, we identified a hospital outbreak of an MCR-1-producing _K. pneumoniae_ ST11 strain among children with acute leukaemia. Our finding suggests that mcr-1 can spread in the hospital environment in the absence of colistin use.""Plasmid-encoded mcr-1 has been detected worldwide in _E. coli_, K. pneumoniae_ and other Enterobacteriaceae, at times co-localized with other resistance genes such as ESBL genes and carbapenemase genes on plasmids. Co-localization of mobile genetic elements could lead to horizontal transfer of multidrug resistance to other nosocomial pathogens and increase the difficulty of antibiotic treatment. When colistin resistance is genetically linked to resistance to other antibiotics on mobile genetic elements, colistin resistance could be co-selected by other antibiotics and spread in a hospital environment, even in the absence of colistin use, as was the case in the hospital outbreak in China described in the above news report. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
