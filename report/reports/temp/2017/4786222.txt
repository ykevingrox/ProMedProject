One particular condition of concern is uveitis, according to research published in the December 2016 issue of _Ophthalmology_ by physicians from the Emory Eye Center and ELWA Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia [Citation: Shantha JG, Crozier I, Hayek BR, et al. Ophthalmic Manifestations and Causes of Vision Impairment in Ebola Virus Disease Survivors in Monrovia, Liberia Ophthalmology. 2016. pii: S0161-6420(16)31510-X. doi: 10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.10.011: abstract available at: <http://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(16)31510-X/abstract>]. After studying a cohort of survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Monrovia, Liberia, using a retrospective, uncontrolled, cross-sectional study, the investigators concluded that survivors of EVD are at risk for uveitis, which may lead to 2ary structural complications, visual impairment, and blindness. Eye care resources should be mobilized for EVD survivors in West Africa because of the frequency of this spectrum of disease complication and its potential for severe VA impairment and blindness.A _Current Opinion in Ophthalmology_ paper reports on nearly 100 EVD survivors in Monrovia, Liberia. Liberia, along with Sierra Leone and Guinea, are the 3 countries most affected by the 2014 EVD outbreak. More than 10 000 cases of EVD were reported in Liberia alone during the recent outbreak; over 28 000 cases were reported during the West African EVD outbreak between 2013 and 2016. Of the 96 patients examined, 21 had developed an EVD-associated uveitis and 3 developed an EVD-associated optic neuropathy. In addition, nearly 40 percent of the patients with uveitis were legally blind, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Other findings include cataract and vitreous opacity (floaters or flashes of light), which can both be complications of untreated uveitis.Citation: Shantha JG, Yeh S and Nguyen QD: Ebola virus disease and the eye. Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2016;27(6):538-544; abstract available at: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/27585217/>Abstract--------The world has witnessed the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa with an unprecedented number of infected individuals and survivors. Many systemic and ocular complications have been reported in survivors. Herein, we review the ophthalmic complications associated with Ebola virus.Recent findings: EVD causes ocular disease during acute infection and during convalescence. Acute patients manifest with conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and acute vision loss of unclear cause. The most common complication during recovery is uveitis with live virus implicated in the pathogenesis in one case.Summary: this epidemic has brought to surface the spectrum of medical complications in EVD survivors with ophthalmic disease being one of the most critical because of its impact on individual functional status and its long-term economic implications. Future studies and programs are needed to appropriately evaluate the spectrum of ophthalmic disease in this at-risk population.- Mod.LK]16 Jan 2017. A bioengineered positive control for rapid detection of the Ebola virus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)<http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00769>[Citation: Lam P, Keri RA and Steinmetz NF: A bioengineered positive control for rapid detection of the Ebola virus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). ACS Biomater. Sci. Eng. DOI: 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00769.Abstract--------The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a highly virulent and deadly disease. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest in history. The rapid spread highlighted the need for a quick and accurate diagnostic method that can be employed in resource-limited conditions. In this study, we developed a probe that can be used as an internal positive control, coupled with a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to accurately detect EBOV. This RT-LAMP assay is a simple 1-step reaction performed at a constant temperature, and the results can be visualized by a colorimetric change from violet to sky blue. Our assay enabled detection of 10 copies of synthetic EBOV RNA within 1 hour. Compared to traditional RT-qPCR, RT-LAMP requires no sophisticated equipment, the results are easier to interpret, and they can be obtained in less time. These features make RT-LAMP an ideal method for detection of EBOV in low-resource settings.][Rapid detection of Ebola is important to separate infected individuals from those with similar symptoms but different etiology as early as possible after presentation at a clinic. Correct rapid diagnosis protects individuals not infected with Ebola virus and allows for more rapid treatment of Ebola patients. - Mod.LK]19 Jan 2017: Scientists identify 'molecular barcode' in blood samples that can predict survival of Ebola patients<http://www.news-medical.net/news/20170119/Scientists-identify-molecular-barcode-in-blood-samples-that-can-predict-survival-of-Ebola-patients.aspx>[Scientists have identified a 'molecular barcode' in the blood of patients with Ebola virus disease that can predict whether they are likely to survive or die from the viral infection. A team at the University of Liverpool, in collaboration with Public Health England, Boston University, and other international partners, used blood samples taken from infected and recovering patients during the 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak to identify gene products that act as strong predictors of patient outcome.Funded by the [UK] National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections and the US Food and Drug Administration, the new research provides data on the underlying causes of Ebola virus infection and suggests that this type of blood analysis could be integrated into future outbreak responses as a diagnostic tool to help guide treatment strategies.Since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa much research has been done to further understand the biology of the Ebola virus. In particular, the processes that lead to survival or a fatal infection are unknown, although the amount of virus present in the body (viral load) can be a key determinant. However, while this premise worked well for predicting outcomes for people with extreme viral loads, it was less clear for people with mid-range counts, the majority of cases, where the outcome prediction was approximately equal between survival and a fatal infection.The results of this new study, which are published in _Genome Biology_, identified a small number of genes whose expression accurately predicts patient survival, independent of viral load.Citation: Liu X, Speranza E, MuÌ±oz-Fontela C, et al: Transcriptomic signatures differentiate survival from fatal outcomes in humans infected with Ebola virus. Genome Biol. 2017;18(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s13059-016-1137-3; available at: <http://bit.ly/2juxExj>][If this tool for outcome prediction is proven to be efficacious, it could help guide treatment, suggesting more aggressive treatment where the patient seems most at risk. - Mod.LK]March 2017: Spatiotemporal fluctuations and triggers of Ebola virus spillover<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-0101_article>[Citation: Schmidt JP, Park AW, Kramer AM, Han BA, Alexander LW and Drake JM: Spatiotemporal fluctuations and triggers of Ebola virus spillover. CDC Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3). doi: 10.3201/eid2303.160101Abstract--------Because the natural reservoir of Ebola virus remains unclear and disease outbreaks in humans have occurred only sporadically over a large region, forecasting when and where Ebola spillovers are most likely to occur constitutes a continuing and urgent public health challenge. We developed a statistical modeling approach that associates 37 human or great ape Ebola spillovers since 1982 with spatiotemporally dynamic covariates including vegetative cover, human population size, and absolute and relative rainfall over 3 decades across sub-Saharan Africa. Our model (area under the curve 0.80 on test data) shows that spillover intensity is highest during transitions between wet and dry seasons; overall, high seasonal intensity occurs over much of tropical Africa; and spillover intensity is greatest at high (greater than 1000/km2) and very low (less than 100/km2) human population densities compared with intermediate levels. These results suggest strong seasonality in Ebola spillover from wild reservoirs and indicate particular times and regions for targeted surveillance.][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow
