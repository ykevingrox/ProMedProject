Pretoria East Rekord [edited]<http://rekordeast.co.za/125630/newsflash-malaria-may-hit-doornpoort/>Two people appear to have died from malaria in the north of Pretoria. The Gauteng department of health said on [Mon 6 Mar 2017] it was investigating ""reported malaria cases"" in Pretoria. Rekord was told that both deaths were in Doornpoort. One of the deaths was on [Sun 5 Mar 2017], a reliable source said. The victim was a woman. Details on the 2nd death could not be obtained at the time of going to press.The department said: ""We and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases are following up on the reported malaria cases in Pretoria to conduct an investigation."" Dr Asomuga Chika of the department's health's outbreak team advised people who had travelled to malaria endemic countries such as Mozambique or Zimbabwe to be wary. They should report to local healthcare centres urgently if they experienced fever symptoms.Health spokesman Steve Mabona said the department needed to verify some information before saying anything more. The Doornpoort doctor who treated the patients was not immediately available for comment. A reliable source said the deaths were 2 separate cases and neither of the patients had travelled recently. Doornpoort ward councillor Hannes Coetzee said it was worrying that the 2 people had no travel history.""But people should remember that symptoms of malaria could take months even a year to appear. We don't have all the facts yet to say the malaria originated from our area."" Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC [member of the executive council ] for Health, agreed that the deaths were unusual. ""We don't have all the information yet. The department of health is investigating,"" he said. ""People should visit their nearest doctor if they display flu symptoms as a safety precaution.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 9 Mar 2017 at 15:10:14 GMTSource: Eyewitness News [edited]<http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/07/nicd-no-malaria-outbreak-in-sa>The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) says 2 cases of malaria detected in Doornpoort in Tshwane [Gauteng] do not represent an outbreak of malaria in South Africa.The institute confirmed on [Mon 6 Mar 2017] that 2 people died from the disease in the past week due to complications. It says a team from its district is conducting an investigation in the area. The institute says the 2 cases are isolated and South Africans should not be alarmed.The institute's professor Lucille Blumberg says, ""These are rare events and we're not going to see a malaria epidemic in Tshwane or related districts."" Blumberg says it's likely the two people were infected by a travelling mosquito. ""That came from some sort of vehicle, in a suitcase or aeroplane from a known malaria area.""The NICD has urged those travelling to malaria areas during the next two months to take precautions.[byline: Thando Kubheka]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the South African National Travel Health Network (SaNTHNet) (<http://www.santhnet.co.za>) update on malaria in South Africa, February 2017, ""The number of malaria cases has increased over the past 2 months following on good rainfall in the malaria transmission areas, as compared to the same period in 2016 during the drought. The number of cases of malaria are expected to increase in the following weeks."" The site includes a map of risk areas in South Africa, and Gauteng Province is not a risk area. Thus, we agree that at present, this is not an outbreak. - Mod.EPMaps of South Africa can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/south_africa_prov_map2.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58716>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
