The Guardian [edited]<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/05/forty-two-people-treated-for-hepatitis-a-linked-to-scottish-bakery>The number of people being treated in a hepatitis A outbreak linked to a bakery has risen from 9 to 42. JB Christie bakery in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, closed temporarily at the weekend after public health officials identified several people who had bought products at its outlets in the town and in nearby Coatbridge and fallen ill. The bakery resumed trading on [Tue 2 May 2017], after carrying out ""additional control measures"" and disposing of all fresh ingredients and any food that could transmit infection. NHS Lanarkshire said there are currently no public health concerns regarding the safety of food produced by the bakery. It urged people to follow good hand hygiene and to remain aware of the possible symptoms of hepatitis A.Dr Femi Oshin, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in public health medicine, said: ""While our investigations continue, we want to remind people that although the risk of contracting the infection is low, anyone who has experienced a flu-like illness, loss of appetite, nausea, fever, abdominal pains or jaundice should contact their GP or, if out of hours, contact NHS24 by dialling 111.""The investigation and assessment at the bakery indicated that products produced and sold between [Mon 20 Mar and Thu 13 Apr 2017] may have been affected, which is why we are advising anyone who ate bakery products which were produced by JB Christie between these dates, and who experiences the above symptoms, to contact their GP or, if out of hours, contact NHS24 on 111. A special helpline has been set up to help the public with general information about hepatitis A and about this outbreak. The free phone number for the helpline is 0800 028 2816 and it is open from 8am to 10pm daily. The bakery fully cooperated with our investigation and undertook additional control measures agreed by NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire council, which enabled it to resume trading on [Tue 2 May 2017].""Hepatitis A is a viral infection that leads to inflammation of the liver and can cause severe illness. The infection clears with time and usually there are no long-term effects, although a very small proportion of people could develop serious complications. It can take 15-50 days from the time the virus enters the body to the development of symptoms, so new cases are likely to continue to be identified in the coming weeks.All 42 cases have had a medical assessment and of those patients who required hospital admission, almost all have been discharged.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is no surprise that the number of cases has increased substantially in less than a week and more cases are likely to be discovered. Since many cases of HAV infection can be asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the true number may be substantially higher. It is certainly likely that a post-baking event such as icing or filling a pastry with jelly was behind the contamination and that the reservoir was a food worker who had acute hepatitis A and inadequate sanitary techniques as has been demonstrated in the past in bakery-associated HAV outbreaks.One report (1) with its abstract below reported transmission of HAV from someone icing pastries after they were cooked and cooled:""In a community hepatitis A outbreak in the Rochester, New York area, 64 of 79 (81 per cent) people with anti-hepatitis A IgM-antibodies and onset of symptoms from 9 April-31 May 1994, recalled eating food obtained from a retail buyer's club. Eleven (65 per cent) of 17 households with cases contained club members compared with 7 (21 per cent) of 34 neighborhood-matched control households (matched odds ratio 8 to 5; 95 per cent CI 1-7-41-6). Club employees who ate sugar-glazed baked goods were at fourfold increased risk for hepatitis. The source of infection was an IgM-positive baker who contaminated baked goods while applying sugar glaze. Computer-generated purchase lists implicated 11-12 March and 21-24 March [2017] as the most likely dates when contamination occurred. This investigation demonstrates the importance of food workers adhering to established hygiene practices. Computer-generated commercial datasets can be useful in epidemiologic investigations.""This paper references the classic bakery-associated HAV outbreak that occurred in 1968, in West Branch, Michigan, which was traced to a baker's assistant who contaminated doughnuts while applying a sugar glaze (2). The West Branch outbreak was popularly described by Berton Roueche and later was turned into a widely used epidemiology teaching exercise (3).1. Weltman AC, Bennett NM, Ackman DA, et al.

Members of the bakery family tested HAV positive a month before the outbreak. That outbreak occurred in 2004 and was reported in: Schenkel K, Bremer V, Grabe C, et al. Outbreak of hepatitis A in 2 federal states of Germany: bakery products as vehicle of infection. Epidemiol Infect. 2006; 134: 1292-1298.Abstract;""In April 2004, increased numbers of hepatitis A were noted in 6 neighboring districts in Germany. Exploratory interviews showed that patients had consumed bakery products from company X where 2 employees had been diagnosed with hepatitis A in February. A case-control study of consumption of products of company X was carried out through telephone interviews. Altogether, 64 cases were identified. A total of 52 cases and 112 controls aged 16 years or over were included in the case-control study. In total, 46/52 cases and 37/112 controls had consumed company X products [odds ratio (OR) 15.5, 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 6.1-39.7]. Of these, 36/46 cases and 16/37 controls had consumed pastries (OR 4.7, 95 per cent CI 1.8-12.3), 25/46 cases and 12/37 controls had consumed filled doughnuts (OR 2.5, 95 per cent CI 1.0-6.1). Sequence analysis of the VP1-2A junction region indicated 100 percent strain homology between cases and an infected employee of company X. We recommended reinforcement of hygiene precautions and consideration of a prolongation of compulsory work absence after post-exposure vaccination.""Vaccination of all food handlers against hepatitis A should prevent such outbreaks. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/280>.]
