The cholera cases have now risen to 11 from 9. The initial cholera cases recorded in Chipata, Mazyopa, Kabanana, and SOS Village stood at 9, according to the Ministry of Health as of 7 Oct 2017. A check at Chipata Level One Hospital and Mazyopa Township yesterday by Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya, his Permanent Secretary for administration, Kennedy Malama, among other officials indicated that the number of cases had gone up by 2 thereby prompting enhanced measures across the province.""Lusaka is on cholera alert, we have a confirmed outbreak of cholera in a localized area in Chipata compound, Mazyopa area zone 2, so far we have 11 cases that have been attended to and we have 6 discharged, 5 are under treatment and they are stable, there are no deaths.""We have 2 cases confirmed of _Vibrio cholerae_ in our UTH [University Teaching Hospital] laboratory and for now we can confirm the outbreak cholera in a localized area in Lusaka, but we are putting the whole Lusaka on cholera alert. What does this mean? It means that the index of suspicion has gone up,"" Dr Chilufya said.Dr Chilufya said water sampling would be intensified in Lusaka Province including enhancing health education and sensitization of the public and that the ministry had partnered with the WHO, Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company and Lusaka City Council (LWSC). Dr Chilufya said the response to the cholera-hit areas had been a multisectoral one and the National Public Health Institute had already triggered the response and that the institution, on behalf of the Ministry of Health, was leading the response measures.Dr Chilufya said a cholera screening center, which he visited, had been set up at Chipata Level One Hospital and that it was where the investigation and stabilization of the suspects was being done and then moving them to a set up cholera center. He assured that the center had adequate logistics and that investigations by sampling water from the sources in the affected communities indicated that water was contaminated and thus prompting the distribution of household chlorine and disinfecting pit latrines.As at yesterday, 8 Oct 2017, about 135 pit latrines had been disinfected, 262 bottles of household chlorine distributed and over 2200 people sensitized with key health messages on avoiding contracting cholera and preventing its spread. After visiting one of the affected families and inspecting one of the 3 boreholes in Mazyopa Township, Dr Chilufya told journalists that investigations by public health specialists revealed that the water from the boreholes was contaminated with coliform bacteria. Dr Chilufya said the 3 boreholes sunk with Constituency Development Funds would be closed and replaced with water bowsers from the LWSC and that the arrangement would continue until a sustainable solution was found. Besides the 3 boreholes, people in the area accessed water through 93 shallow wells and Care-run water kiosks.[Byline: Chusa Sichone]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The sudden increase in cases of cholera in Lusaka is of some concern.
