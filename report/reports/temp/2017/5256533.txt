Discovery of a highly divergent coronavirus in the Asian house shrew from China illuminates the origin of the alphacoronaviruses. J Virol. 2017. pii: JVI.00764-17. abstract available at <http://jvi.asm.org/content/91/17/e00764-17.abstract>]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract---------Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (_Suncus murinus_) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02 percent. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into 4 lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus _Alphacoronavirus_, which we denote WÌ©nchÌ©ng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Coronavirus (subfamily Coronavirinae) are of importance because they comprise several human and animal pathogens. The origin of alphacoronaviruses had been linked to bats. These data suggest that shrews might have played a role, too. - Mod.PMA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
