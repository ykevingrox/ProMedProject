Since it is not a reportable disease in Nepal, the exact scenario of _V. parahaemolyticus_ is not accurately known, though Rai et al. isolated vibrio species including _V. parahaemolyticus_ from sewage of the Kathmandu valley during June-September in 2008 (1).Reference1. Rai KR, Rai SK, Bhatt DR, et al. Study of medically important Vibrios in the sewage of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Nepal Med Coll J. 2012;14:212-15. (available at: <http://nmcth.edu/images/gallery/Original%20Articles/OJwJBKR%20Rai.pdf>).--Dr Sher Bahadur PunClinical Research UnitSukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease HospitalKathmandu, Nepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[ProMED thanks Dr Pun for this posting.Regarding the presence of a non-cholera _Vibrio sp._ in Nepal, a landlocked country, it is certainly the case that most of the cases are reported in countries with seashore so that there is easy access to the environment where these halophilic vibrios exist. It is possible that imported seawater or shellfish were responsible for this outbreak. In the reference cited above, however, there is a report from Nepal of non-cholera vibrios being isolated from sewage of the Kathmandu Valley. Of the 42 positive samples, 27 were _V. cholerae_ but 11 were _V. vulnificus_, 5 were _V. parahaemolyticus_. Species furnissi, fluvalis and alginolyticus were also isolated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2877>.][See Also:2016 ----Vibrio parahaemolyticus - Canada: (BC) shellfish 20160708.4333739Vibrio species gastroenteritis - Nepal (02): (KT) 20160525.4242624Vibrio species gastroenteritis - Nepal: (Kathmandu) RFI 20160518.42302312015 ----Vibrio parahaemolyticus - Canada (BC,AB): shellfish 20150815.3580619Vibrio parahaemolyticus - Thailand: chicken blood 20150117.30973082014 ----Vibrio parahaemolyticus - USA (02): (NY) shellfish harvesting ban 20140913.2768717Vibrio parahaemolyticus - USA: eastern spread of western strains, 2013 20140418.2412007].................................................ll/ec/mpp"
