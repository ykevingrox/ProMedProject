January's [2017] total far surpasses numbers for January over the past 3 years [2014, 2015, 2016], which ranged between 20 and 31.Some 192 people were infected last month [January 2017], the commission said, bringing the total since October [2016] to 306.The latest data will reinforce concerns about the spread of the virus among humans as neighboring South Korea and Japan also battle major outbreaks among their poultry flocks.Chinese disease control experts have warned the public to stay alert for H7N9 avian flu. The virus usually strikes in winter and spring, and farmers have in recent years ramped up measures such as cleaning regimes to prevent the disease.Many major cities in the world's 3rd-largest producer of broiler chickens and the second-biggest consumer of poultry have also closed some live poultry markets after people and chickens were infected by avian flu strains. China has confirmed 5 bird flu outbreaks among poultry this winter, which has led to the culling of more than 175 000 birds.Widespread infection can lead to severe health risks and big financial losses. The last major outbreak in China was in 2013, causing more than USD 6 billion in losses for the agricultural sector.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As many as 4 new cases of avian influenza A/H7N9 and 1 death have been reported from China since [11 Feb 2017].
