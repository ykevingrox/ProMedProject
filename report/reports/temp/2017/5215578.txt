Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/vibrio-vulnificus-updates-mobile-county-florida-68827/>_Vibrio vulnificus_ updates: Mobile County and Florida---------------------Mobile County (Alabama)The 1st case involved a Mobile County resident who consumed raw oysters in another state in March 2017. The 2nd incident took place in April 2017 and also involved the consumption of raw oysters while in Mobile County. An investigation confirmed that the oysters were imported from another state and were not harvested locally.The other 2 cases took place during June 2017 and came from wound exposure while in bodies of water near Dauphin Island, the Mississippi Sound, and Mobile Bay.Florida-----The number of _V. vulnificus_ cases has risen by 2 cases since our last report, bringing the total to 12 for 2017 to date. The newest cases are reported from Escambia County and a 2nd case from Lee County. One fatality has been reported this year [2017]._Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause life-threatening illness when ingested or if it enters a skin wound.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).""There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLProMED HealthMaps:Alabama: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/205>Florida: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>]
