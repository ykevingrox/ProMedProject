Japan Times [edited]<http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/10/national/infant-botulism-claims-6-month-old-adachi-ward-boy-fed-honey/#.WOvfmUXyteM>A 6 month old boy in Adachi Ward, Tokyo, died late last month [March 2017] of infant botulism after his family fed him honey, according to the metropolitan government. Metropolitan officials said it was the 1st death caused by infant botulism in Japan since 1986, when the government began compiling such statistics.The officials warned that babies younger than one year should not be given honey. They said the Adachi boy died on 30 Mar 2017. He developed a cough on [16 Feb 2017] and was taken to a hospital by ambulance on [20 Feb 2017] after going into convulsions and suffering respiratory failure. He was diagnosed [on 28 Feb 201] as having infant botulism.The officials said the boy's family had been giving him honey mixed in juice twice a day for about a month, and that they were not aware babies should not be fed honey. [Evidence of] the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ was found in an unsealed honey container in the family's house and in the boy's excrement. A public health center confirmed that the boy's death was caused by botulism poisoning.Infant botulism can occur when newborns, who have immature digestive systems, ingest bacteria that produce toxins inside the bowels.According to the health ministry, Japan's 1st recorded case of the disease was confirmed in Chiba Prefecture in 1986 and the ministry issued a warning the following year to prefectures nationwide not to feed honey to babies. According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, more than 30 cases of infant botulism have been reported nationwide since 1986, but none was fatal.--communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from CDC's report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):""Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL] Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.""Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing.""Although not specifically stated in this post, botulism immune globulin (BIG) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.References----------1. Underwood K, Rubin S, Deaker T, Newth C.
