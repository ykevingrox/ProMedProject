The Japan Times [edited]<https://tinyurl.com/yaujlfzu>.A 5 year old girl is in a critical condition and 2 others are severely ill after eating a supermarket potato salad product infected with _Escherichia coli_ O157, Saitama Prefecture said [on Mon 21 Aug 2017]. The victims all ate potato salad sold at the Shokusaikan Marche Kagohara supermarket in the city of Kumagaya, Saitama prefecture, the prefecture said. In addition to the girl, who remains unconscious, a 4 year old boy and a 60 year old woman have been hospitalized. All 3 are not expected to be discharged soon.According to Saitama prefecture, the supermarket's deli -- Derishasu Kagohara -- procured the potato salad from a food-processing factory from outside the prefecture, then mixed cut pieces of ham and apples. The Kumagaya Public Health Center has ordered that the deli be closed for 3 days amid an investigation into the food poisoning, including what caused the _E. coli_ infection and the routes through which the salad was distributed.The incident came to light after the prefecture was notified of a boy being admitted to a Gunma prefecture hospital on 14 Aug 2017. The Kumagaya Public Health Center learned that 8 Saitama residents, who all ate the potato salad sold on 7 and 8 Aug 2017, complained of stomach pains. 3 others ranging in age from 7 to 12 were also hospitalized for symptoms such as diarrhea, but have been released from hospitals already.The 5 year old girl who remains in critical condition has been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition caused by an abnormal destruction of red blood cells.Fresh Corp, a Gunma-based supermarket and deli store chain, said no other outlets have reported cases of food poisoning. The firm has apologized for the incident on its website.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not clear if the individuals who became ill earlier in the month also suffered from enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection. Potato salad seems to be the vehicle for transmission of the infection. Since potatoes are served after cooking, the likely source is not the potatoes themselves but rather an ingredient added to the food. Pork products are not common carriers of EHEC but this has been reported (E. coli EHEC - Canada (04): (AB) O157, pork products, recall 20140909.2759887). Apples can carry EHEC especially if harvested after falling from the tree and outbreaks have occurred from unpasteurized apple juice or cider (E. coli EHEC - USA (19): (CA) O111, unpasteurized apple juice, alert, recall 20151107.3774944; E. coli, toxigenic, apple cider - USA (Oklahoma) 19991019.1857). It is also possible that cross contamination during preparation from other foods could have occurred related to poor kitchen hygiene. ProMED-mail would like more information regarding this outbreak.It may be recalled by ProMED-mail readers and evident from the flurry of ProMED-mail postings from Japan in 1996 and 1997 shown below that substantially more cases of this disease occurred in that time frame. The following is from FAO/WHO Global Forum of Food Safety Regulators, Marrakesh, Morocco, 28-30 Jan 2002, Investigation system for foodborne outbreaks in Japan: (<http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/X6924E.HTM>). ""...in 1996, many outbreaks of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infection, involved 11 826 cases and 12 deaths, occurred in Japan. 16 outbreaks among them affected more than 10 people and comprised 10 275 cases. Epidemiological investigations revealed that the sources of infection in these 16 outbreaks included school lunches served at elementary schools and child care centers (9 outbreaks, 9845 patients), nursing home meals (3 outbreaks, 123 patients), a meal served at an industrial facility (1 outbreak, 47 patients), a commercially prepared box lunch (1 outbreak, 191 patients), and unknown sources (2 outbreaks, 58 patients).""Maps of Japan can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/cities_of_japan_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5021>.Saitama prefecture is in central Japan on Honshu Island. - Mod.LL]
