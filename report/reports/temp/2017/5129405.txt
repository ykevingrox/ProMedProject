The disease is mainly transmitted by the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito, which is known to breed in rice fields, ponds and irrigation canals.The CDC has advised people to avoid visiting such places and animal farms, especially at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.People suffering from Japanese encephalitis can experience serious psychological and neurological symptoms, and the disease has a mortality rate as high as 20-30 percent, according to the CDC.[Byline: Chen Wei-ting and Y.F. Low]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of JE cases continues to slowly increase in Taiwan.The specific locality where she acquired her infection is uncertain. JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individual above had not been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.Maps of Taiwan can be seen at <http://www.tmf.org.tw/index.php/maps-taiwan> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3962>. - Mod.TY]
