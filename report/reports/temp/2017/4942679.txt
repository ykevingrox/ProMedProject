The Star [edited]<https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/03/30/a-year-later-health-officials-still-battling-strep-outbreak-at-mens-shelter.html>A year later, health officials [are] still battling [a] strep outbreak at men's shelter. A stubborn outbreak of Group A streptococcus [GAS or _Streptococcus pyogenes_] has claimed one life and sickened 64 other men at Seaton House over past year [since March 2016].The illness is a highly contagious bacterial infection and can result in fever, sore throat and in rare cases severe and potentially lethal blood infections. The men living in the city's largest shelter and shared hostel space, many already dealing with underlying health issues, are particularly vulnerable. ""The outbreak is continuing, we never declared it over,"" said Dr. Michael Finkelstein, associate medical officer of health, with Toronto Public Health.""The number of cases has decreased considerably, compared to numbers we were seeing last summer and we are continuing to work with Seaton House on outbreak response measures,"" he said. A total of 4 new cases were diagnosed during the last 2 weeks of March [2016].The official outbreak was declared at Seaton House on [March 31 2016], 2 weeks after the 1st case was reported to public health and an investigation was launched.One year later, the total number of cases has hit 65, including at least 4 staff members. Of that group, 8 became seriously ill and one man died, though the cause of death has not been officially determined.In many ways, Seaton House was the perfect place for an outbreak to occur, according to public health experts. The 4-story facility includes a hostel and 2 floors designed to serve as a permanent residence for men, some struggling with addiction and mental health issues and many living out what should be considered their retirement years. ""They are vulnerable, they are older, they have underlying conditions, they are living in a shelter. This all increases the risk of them being infected with this bacteria,"" said Finkelstein.People with healthy immune systems who contract strep usually have a severe sore throat and fever, while most of the cases at Seaton House were related to skin conditions, he said. Any crack or deep scratch in the skin is a perfect place for the bacteria to creep in and people with compromised immune systems have difficulty fighting infections, he said. In rare cases a potentially deadly and invasive strain of the disease can result in meningitis, toxic shock syndrome or even flesh-eating disease. There were no cases of flesh-eating disease at Seaton House.The 8 severe cases, including the death, were all tied to a more invasive strain and resulted in blood infections, he said. At least 5 required hospitalization. None of the recent cases required hospitalization.Back at Seaton House, all staff have been trained to spot signs of the infection and provided with supplies to keep it at bay, including heavy-duty cleaning equipment, extra gloves and hand sanitizer, though it is administered by staff because of the alcohol content. At one point, a staff member's full-time job was just wiping down surfaces. Mattresses have also been replaced in the past 6 months, although that was pre-planned.Seaton House has a long history in Toronto. The 1st building dates back to 1931, but the current George St. location is scheduled to be demolished within the next 2 years, as part of a development plan that will include new emergency and long-term shelter beds, and affordable housing units. It will mean the temporary displacement of men who have made the shelter their home, although part of the argument to raze the building is that there are too many high needs men using the space, making disease transmission more likely.On [Wed 29 Mar 2017] night, there were 70 men staying on the 3rd floor and 94 on the 4th and city staff said services were provided to a total of 459 men. Monica Waldman, manager of Seaton House, said in a statement that they count on the ""incredible rapport"" nursing staff and everybody else working at Seaton House has with clients, combined with rigorous cleaning and training, to quickly identify cases and try to control the spread of the disease. ""We do whatever it takes as we know that there is no other service that provides this level of support to these extremely vulnerable and marginalized men,"" she said.Last summer, after the 1st surge of cases, Toronto Public Health enlisted the help of 2 extra infectious disease experts and all residents and staff members were swabbed or checked for strep. Finkelstein said strep passes from person to person through coughing or sneezing, but the bacteria can live on dry surfaces for up to 6 months. Sharing drinks and cigarettes is also an easy way for it to spread.Last fall [2016], they managed to control the spread with no new cases for a few months, but then new cases were diagnosed in late 2016 and early this year [2017]. Finkelstein said strep is ubiquitous and the men in Seaton House are very likely to come into contact with the bacteria outside the facility, as are most Toronto residents.[Byline: Emily Mathieu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Group A streptococcus (GAS) is commonly associated with pharyngitis and skin infections but can also cause invasive infections, including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis (NF), toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur.GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (<http://www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html>). Over 200 _emm_ types have been identified.Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and detection of exotoxin-encoding genes (<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948>, <http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192>, <http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416>, and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911>). Molecular analysis of the isolates aids documenting a common source of an outbreak.We have not been told if molecular typing has been done on the isolates in the current outbreak at the Seaton House shelter. Further information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and the provincial capital of Ontario (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>.]
