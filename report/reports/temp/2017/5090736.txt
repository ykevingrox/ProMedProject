Anadolu Agency [edited]<http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/cholera-outbreak-kills-746-in-yemen-who/836408>At least 746 people have died since a cholera epidemic broke out in Yemen in late April 2017, according to the WHO. In a Twitter post on Wed 7 Jun 2017, the WHO's Yemen office said more than 96 000 suspected cases of cholera had been registered in the war-torn country. On Tue 6 Jun 2017, the UN agency said at least 728 Yemenis had died from the epidemic. Several international organizations -- including the WHO, UNICEF and the Red Cross -- have recently stepped up the delivery of medical supplies to Yemen, where local health authorities have struggled to cope with the outbreak.Local officials say the ongoing fighting between Saudi-backed government forces and Houthi rebels has frustrated efforts to deal with the crisis. Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when the Houthis and their allies overran much of the country, including the capital Sana'a.In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government.[Byline: Mohammed al-Samei]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 746The outbreak continues essentially unabated; in the past 4 days, there have been about 22 300 new cases and 141 deaths. These numbers are, no doubt, a small amount of the total, since as few as 10-20 percent of _V. cholerae_ cases are overt. At that rate, the next 4 weeks could produce an overall total of almost 250 000 reported cases and more than 1700 deaths.Aggressive interventions to stem this substantial outbreak in Yemen including sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign are problematic because of the ongoing conflict in the country. An intervention with vaccine, if possible, could potentially stem the tide of the ongoing event. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.""The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).References----------57.
