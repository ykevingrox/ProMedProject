Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2017. pii: AAC.02382-16. doi: 10.1128/AAC.02382-16. [Epub ahead of print]; <http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2017/01/05/AAC.02382-16>"".The study reports 4 patients with _P. falciparum_ malaria infected in Angola, Uganda (2), and Liberia returning to the UK, treated with artemether-lumefantrine. All patients initially cleared parasitemia, but presented with recrudescence up to a month later. No patients visited malaria endemic areas and thus reinfection is ruled out. The parasites underwent genetic analysis and all showed different mutations, which probably could explain the treatment failure (see the study for details). The authors discuss if failure to absorb the artemether-lumefantrine could be a possibility and acknowledge that it is a limitation that drug levels were not measured.A previous report from 2012 also reported artemisinin resistance in _P. falciparum_ malaria from East Africa (Pillai DR, Lau R, Khairnar K, et al: Artemether resistance in vitro is linked to mutations in PfATP6 that also interact with mutations in PfMDR1 in travellers returning with _Plasmodium falciparum_ infections. Malaria J 2012; 11(1): 131 doi:10.1186/1475-2875-11-131; <https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-11-131>).The present study describes what is called R1 resistance with delayed recrudescence by the WHO (WHO Technical Report Series No. 529, Geneva 1973), where there is a satisfactory initial treatment response with the patient being parasite free day 7 after treatment start, but parasitemia recrudesces 2 weeks or more later.The geographical wide area covered by the report (Angola, Uganda, and Liberia) suggests that R1 resistance to artemether-lumefantrine may be widespread in Africa. Especially in high endemic areas, delayed recrudescence may easily be overlooked because new infection as an explanation for new findings of _P. falciparum_ is difficult to exclude if genotyping is not available. R1 resistance may indicate that resistance may increase and the results underline that the artemisinins should never be used as single drugs, only in combination with other drugs. - Mod.EP]
