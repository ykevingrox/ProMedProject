Clearwater Patch [edited]<https://patch.com/florida/clearwater/deadly-florida-seawater-bacteria-claims-3rd-life>The Florida Department of Health on [Thu 31 Aug 2017], confirmed the 3rd _Vibrio vulnificus_-related death in 2017. A total of 15 other people have been sickened by the seawater bacterium in counties across the state in 2017. The latest bacterium-related death occurred in Santa Rosa County, according to state records. Details about the person who died following exposure are not being released, but the source of infection is known in this case. The person who died was exposed through an open wound that came in contact with bacteria-contaminated water, Mara Gambineri, FDOH's spokeswoman, told Patch on [Thu 31 Aug 2017]. The circumstances of exposure in the 1st 2 fatal cases are unknown. The other deaths reported in 2017 occurred in Brevard and Orange counties.""_Vibrio vulnificus_ is a naturally occurring bacterium in raw shellfish and in warm, brackish/salty seawater,"" Gambineri explained in a previous interview. ""_Vibrio vulnificus_ exposures occur more commonly during the summer months when water temperatures rise - the majority of our cases occur between May and October. The bacterium does not pose a risk to a normally healthy people and Florida's beaches and water are safe to enjoy responsibly.""People can become infected with _Vibrio vulnificus_ in one of 2 ways - by eating contaminated raw shellfish and through exposure to contaminated water by swimming with open wounds.The 15 non-fatal cases confirmed across the state since the year began are as follows: Charlotte County - 1 caseCitrus County - 1 caseCollier County - 1 caseDuval County - 1 caseEscambia County - 2 casesLee County - 2 casesOkaloosa County - 1 casePasco County - 1 casePolk County - 1 caseSanta Rosa County - 1 case (not including the fatality)Sumter County - 3 cases_Vibrio vulnificus_ is often called the ""flesh-eating"" bacterium, but that's not [totally] an accurate label, the state has said. Most people who come into contact with the bacterium don't show severe symptoms. Signs of exposure in normally healthy people include symptoms such as stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. ""People with weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease, have an increased risk of infection and should take precautions,"" Gambineri said. ""Additionally, people with any open cuts, scrapes or abrasions should avoid exposing the wound to seawater to prevent infection.""When open wounds come in contact with _Vibrio vulnificus_, the CDC says infections that arise ""may lead to skin breakdown and ulceration."" When that breakdown of skin tissue occurs, it's caused by a serious complication, known as necrotizing fasciitis. It's that complication that gives rise to the ""flesh-eating"" moniker.""Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare disease that can be caused by more than one type of bacterium,"" Gambineri said in a previous interview. ""These include group A streptococcus (group A strep), _Klebsiella_, _Clostridium_, _Escherichia coli_, _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Aeromonas hydrophila_, among others. Group A strep is considered the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis. Vibrio vulnificus and necrotizing fasciitis are not one in the same.""In 2016, there were 46 confirmed _Vibrio vulnificus_-related illnesses across Florida; 10 of those cases resulted in fatalities.[Byline: Sherri Lonon]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not stated if the woman had an underlying chronic disease but it is likely that she did.The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.""The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. It is not clear that the woman in this post had any well defined risk factors. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave.Santa Rosa County is located in the so-called panhandle area of northern Florida and can be seen on a map at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa_County,_Florida#/media/File:Map_of_Florida_highlighting_Santa_Rosa_County.svg>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.]
