New York Times [edited]<https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/10/11/world/americas/ap-cb-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico.html>A total of 4 deaths in Hurricane Maria's aftermath are being investigated as possible cases of a disease spread by animals' urine [leptospirosis], Puerto Rico's governor said [Wed 11 Oct 2017] amid concerns about islanders' exposure to contaminated water.A total of 10 people have come down with suspected cases of leptospirosis, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said at a news conference.On a U.S. territory where a 3rd of customers remain without running water 3 weeks after the hurricane, some became ill after turning to local streams to relieve their thirst. A 61-year-old bus driver, took a drink from a stream near his concrete home on a hillside in Canovanas a week after the [20 Sep 2017] storm. He then developed a fever, his skin turned yellow and within a week, he died at a hospital in Carolina, according to his widow. Dr. Juan Santiago said [the patient] was among 5 patients who came in his emergency clinic last week with similar symptoms after drinking from streams in Canovanas and LoÌ za.The water was still not running at [the patient's] house this week, but [his widow], said she and her family were drinking only bottled water, including some delivered by the town. Her husband was the only one who drank from the stream, she said.As many as 45 deaths in Puerto Rico have been blamed on Hurricane Maria, which tore across the island with 150 mph (240 kph) winds. Currently 90 percent of the island is still without power and the government says it hopes to have electricity restored completely by March [2018].Leptospirosis is not uncommon in the tropics, particularly after heavy rains or floods. Rossello said the symptoms can be confused with those of other illnesses, including dengue, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was helping to investigate. Two of the deaths were in Bayamon, and one each in Carolina and Mayaguez. Other patients have been receiving treatment with antibiotics. Rossello said that fliers with instructions on how to disinfect water will be sent to mayors for distribution with food supplies in towns across Puerto Rico. ""For people that have access to internet and have access to printers, be good citizens and help us distribute this information,"" Rossello said.The Health Department and the U.S. military also will be distributing pills to purify water, he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[San Juan is the capital of Puerto Rico and its largest city by population (395 326 residents) located on the northeast coast (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico>).

Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.Parts of Puerto Rico saw more than 30 inches of rain and subsequent flooding with recent Hurricane Maria.
