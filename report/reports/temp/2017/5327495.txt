ASL Latina [in Italian, machine trans. and Mod.TY, edited]<https://www.ausl.latina.it/comunicati-stampa/1568-comunicato-stampa-del-15-09-2017-chikungunya>In our Latina province to date, 4 chikungunya cases have been registered, 2 confirmed and 2 probable.Chikungunya virus disease manifests itself with symptoms similar to influenza, with high fever, chills, headache, etc. and arthralgia, and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_, which in our country is represented by the mosquito _Aedes albopictus_, commonly called the tiger mosquito.Not everyone who encounters an infected mosquito will show the symptoms; in any case, the disease is self-limiting.As a result of the recorded cases and on the basis of Circular No. 20 957 dated 10 Jul 2017 from the Ministry of Health, the Mayor of the Municipality of Latina has already been informed by jurisdiction officials. At the same time, it is advising all provincial agencies to take preparatory actions when any pandemic interventions are initiated in the event of a case-by-case verification.A dedicated ""Arbovirosi Outpatient Clinic"" was activated at the SMGoretti UOC Infectious Diseases Hospital for an initial period of 2 weeks from Monday to Friday, with direct access to prescription by general practitioners for suspected cases attended on their own; the outpatient clinic will also provide general practitioners with medical advice by specialists by telephone.A series of recommendations for the general population will be available on the Latina ASL web site in the coming hours for the prevention of insect bites.--Communicated by:Remigio RussoProfessional Journalist<remigiorusso@tin.it>[ProMED-mail thanks Remigio Russo for sending in this report and noting that it is the 3rd focus of transmission.The number of foci of chikungunya virus infections has increased from 2 in the previous post to 3, the most recent in Latina province. Apparently, the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, is the vector implicated in the Latina outbreak and likely in the other foci. This outbreak is beginning to look like the one in 2007 in Emilia Romagna in central Italy, which was also transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_.Maps of Italy can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_admin_06.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63107>. - Mod.TY]
