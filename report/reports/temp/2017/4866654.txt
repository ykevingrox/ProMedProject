He was treated for fever, diarrhoea, and coughing a few days earlier. Family members confirmed that he was bitten by a tick.Speaking to the media this morning [24 Feb 2017] in Windhoek, health permanent secretary [PS] Andreas Mwoombola urged the nation not to panic as the ministry has everything under control. ""Indeed the case that was reported was Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever,"" Mwoombola said.He added that the World Health Organisation and the epidemiology department in the ministry will scan the whole area where the patient was from as part of taking action.As a response and intervention, 4 nurses and a doctor who had close contact with the deceased have been quarantined and are currently being monitored at Gobabis.Although there is no vaccination or exact treatment for the virus and the symptoms are treated as they come, Mwoombola said that not all who get the virus die.Mwoombola said that 3 cases were reported before and 2 patients survived. One incident was in 2002 at the Windhoek Central Hospital while another was in 2010 of a southern farmer from the Aroab [Karas Region], who later died at a hospital in Bloemfontein.""Being a nurse myself, I have nursed a young boy who was 10 years old and he survived,"" the PS said.A state doctor, David /Uirab, also said that although the virus is feared, not everyone who gets it will die. ""We do have an isolation unit at the Windhoek Central Hospital and the ministry is ready should the situation escalate,"" /Uirab said.He added that the healthcare workers who came into contact with the deceased are not showing any symptoms but will be kept under observation for seven days.""Incubation period from time of the virus entering the body is 6 to 7 days,"" he said.He added that people should not take being bitten by a tick lightly and should seek medical attention immediately.Mwoombola said the ministry will go to the different vernacular radio stations to inform the nation about the virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Namibia is a country located in southwest Africa and distinguished by the Namib Desert along its Atlantic Ocean coast.

She also said that the results of tests of the people in isolation in Windhoek are expected this week ""to make final confirmation.""Mwoombola said the people were tested for the virus and the medical team are still waiting for the results to confirm if they have the virus, while the medical team being quarantined in Gobabis were also reported to be doing well.''Staff under quarantine at Gobabis hospital are doing fine,'' he affirmed. The isolation is done over 5 to 6 days. Farmworkers at the farm where the virus originated are under surveillance and no new suspected case was reported over the weekend [25-26 Feb 2017]. ""In general the situation is under control,"" stressed Paulus.Mwoombola said that before the 26-year-old man died of the virus on Monday last week [20 Feb 2017] he was treated and tested for malaria, which turned out negative.''After the test the victim was sent home but came back a day later complaining of the same symptoms,'' he said.According to Mwoombola, health workers were informed that a tick bit the person a few days before his coming to hospital.Mwoombola said the patient, who worked at a farm in the Gobabis district, was put in isolation with supportive management but died on [22 Feb 2017] at around 20h00.Currently a medical team from the ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO) are in the area of the farm where the deceased worked to monitor and take quarantine steps if another case surfaces.Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is transmitted to people by ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ and through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and after slaughtering an animal. The virus is of the family _Bunyaviridae_.Mwoombola cautioned the public to visit any nearest health facility if they experience symptoms ranging from fever, muscle ache to dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).''If a person is bitten by a tick, it should not be taken lightly but report it to any nearby health centre,'' cautioned Mwoombola.Although the virus cannot be treated and there is no vaccination for it, supportive treatment can be administered.[Byline: Petrus Muronga]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[From the time that the presence of CCHF was first recognized in 1981 up to 2000, a total of 158 cases of CCHF have been diagnosed in southern Africa, with one infection having occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo (the former Zaire), one in Tanzania, 10 in Namibia, and the remainder in South Africa. Most patients were employed in the livestock industry, and males constitute the majority of cases (<http://www.daff.gov.za/docs/Infopaks/congohaemo.pdf>).Apart from people directly involved in the livestock industry, persons at risk of being bitten by ticks include those who live in the countryside and town dwellers who visit the countryside for occupational or recreational purposes, including hunting and hiking. People are not always aware of being bitten by ticks, and in patients with Congo fever ticks have been found attached in concealed sites, such as on the scalp and between the toes.Transmission from ticks can be avoided through the use of repellants (for example DEET, permethrin). Adherence to universal precautions, including the use of personal protective measures are essential for health care workers. This includes wearing of gloves when dealing with tissues and blood, face masks, and protective clothing. Patients are usually non-infectious by the time they are clinically recovered (afebrile, no bleeding, normal platelets and blood clotting profile). Health care workers and family contacts should be followed up for 14 days post-exposure with twice-daily temperature and symptom monitoring (<http://www.nicd.ac.za/assets/files/NICD_CCHFFAQ_2017January_final.pdf>). - Mod.UBA][There is an inconsistency between the 2 news reports above: 1st news report says that the ""farmworker (26) died on Wednesday [22 Feb 2017]"" and the 2nd news report says that ""the 26-year-old man died of the virus on Monday last week [20 Feb 2017]."" However, the Ministry of Health confirms that this patient died on 22 Feb 2017 (<http://www.mhss.gov.na/>). - Mod.ML]]
