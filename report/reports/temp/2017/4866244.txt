Relief Web [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/chad/chad-hepatitis-e-epidemic-ocha-ministry-public-health-echo-echo-daily-flash-25-february>The Ministry of Public Health of Chad has officially declared an epidemic of hepatitis E in the region of Salamat, southeastern Chad.The epidemic has already claimed the lives of 12 people, including 4 pregnant women. A total of 956 cases have been identified so far. MSF and UNICEF are currently working with the authorities to provide a response in a context of insufficient epidemiological surveillance, very limited presence of medical actors, and lack of safe access to water and sanitation.Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus. It is transmitted from one person to another, mainly through contaminated water.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html>). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57>.]
