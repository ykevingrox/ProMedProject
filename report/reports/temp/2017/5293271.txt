WWMT, NewsChannel3 [edited]<http://wwmt.com/news/local/possible-case-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever-contracted-by-local-woman>A Kalamazoo-area [Michigan] woman says she contracted a rare and sometimes deadly disease at a local lake. ""Developed a rash all down my ankles. Feet, arms,"" explained [AG]. ""I had stiffness in the back of my neck. I had severe migraines, where I thought my head was going to explode."" [AG] says she was visiting a friend by Long Lake, in Portage, when [a tick bit her]. A couple weeks later, she developed a high fever, full body aches, and severe rashes. She went to the hospital, where doctors treated her for a suspected case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Doctor David Davenport, at Borgess Hospital says the disease is more common down south, but that's starting to change. ""What we've been seeing recently because of global warming is a changed pattern of all diseases, increased incidents of Lyme diseases, and other tick-borne diseases with mosquitoes with global warming,"" he said.According to the State Health Department, there have been 17 cases of the disease in Michigan this year [2017] --a huge spike from years past. The CDC says about one in 5 untreated cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever result in death. [AG] says her doctor notified the CDC about her case, but her blood tests still need to be analyzed before it's a confirmed case.[Byline: Mike Krafcik]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a nationally reportable, tickborne illness caused by the bacterium _Rickettsia rickettsii_ and transmitted in the United States by one of several species of ticks that include the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_), the Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_), and the brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_). A picture of a female _Dermacentor variabilis_, which is the most common tick species in Michigan, can be found at <http://tinyurl.com/y92ulu5e>. Ticks can become infected by feeding on blood of infected small mammals and once infected, the female tick can transmit the infection to her offspring.The illness in humans is characterized by fever, headache, and skin rash that first appears on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and then spreads to include palms and soles, and the trunk. However, some people never develop the rash. A picture of the skin rash can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/ycyrbd5a>. The rash can become progressively more purpuric and rarely evolve into purpura fulminans associated with consumptive coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular clotting, multiorgan failure, and shock (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/362535>). RMSF is potentially fatal if not treated promptly with an appropriate antibiotic. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice for both adults and children of any age and should be started when the diagnosis is first suspected.The diagnosis of RMSF is confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) performed on 2 serum samples taken 3 weeks apart, the 1st sample being low or negative and the 2nd showing a 4-fold increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG but are less specific and more likely to represent a false positive (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/TickborneDiseases.pdf>).Because of the inability of the commonly available serologic tests to differentiate between spotted fever group rickettsial species, as of 1 Jan 2010, cases of RMSF have been reported under a new category called spotted fever rickettsiosis (SFR). SFR includes RMSF, _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever (caused by _R. philippi_), and rickettsialpox (caused by _R. akari_). Inclusion of these less severe spotted fevers has likely lead to some extent to the increased incidence and the lower case fatality rate observed in recent decades (<https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html>). Incidence of RMSF has increased from less than 2 cases per million people in 2000 to more than 11 cases per million in 2014, according to the CDC and the proportion of RMSF cases resulting in death, known as the case fatality rate, has dropped to less than 0.5 percent (<https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html>). Of the thousands of cases of spotted fever group rickettsiosis that occur every year, it is unclear exactly how many of these cases are RMSF and how many result from the other, less severe spotted fevers.SFR cases are reported throughout the United States, but Michigan has been one of the low incidence states (0.1 to 1.0 case per million people in 2014). The best way to prevent RMSF is avoiding tick bites (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/on_people.html>).The state of Michigan can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41945>. Portage, with a population of 46 292 in the 2010, is a city in Kalamazoo county in the southwestern portion of the US state of Michigan (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage,_Michigan>). - Mod.ML]
