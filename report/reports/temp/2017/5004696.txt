El Heraldo de Chihuahua [in Spanish, machine trans. edited]<https://www.elheraldodechihuahua.com.mx/chihuahua/610250-confirman-20-casos-de-rickettsia-por-picadura-de-garrapata-en-Chihuahua>So far in 2017, 20 confirmed cases of rickettsial infection, transmitted by tick bite, have been registered in Chihuahua. Of these, 9 people have died, according to Ministry of Health staff.All the cases of rickettsiosis have occurred in the municipality of Chihuahua, so it is recommended to maintain personal hygiene at home and to allocate an adequate space for pets, keeping it clean and bathing pets at least twice monthly with anti-insect soap.In 2016 in the state of Chihuahua, 55 cases of rickettsiosis were confirmed, of which 17 people died.Rickettiosis is a disease that causes fever, headache and general discomfort accompanied by red patches on the skin. Once the disease is diagnosed, only the doctor can indicate the right medication.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Chihuahua is one of the 32 states of Mexico. It is located in Northwestern Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the west, Sinaloa to the southwest, Durango to the south, and Coahuila to the east. To the north and northeast, it has a long border with the USA adjacent to the states of New Mexico and Texas. The state can be found on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)>.The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. The number of non-fatal cases of the infection is not stated for 2014.When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins on day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular [a flat rash with small raised bumps] at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric [small and larger red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin], involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpurae usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.The early rash of this disease can be seen at <http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever_PHIL_1962_lores.jpg>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14>.]
