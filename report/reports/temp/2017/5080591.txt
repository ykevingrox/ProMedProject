Cherwell [edited]<http://www.cherwell.org/2017/05/26/outbreak-of-mumps-plagues-oxfords-colleges/>An outbreak of mumps has left students sent home, cricket games cancelled, and preliminary and final exams under threat as students across Oxford come down with the infection. Cherwell has learned that major outbreaks have occurred at Exeter, Corpus Christi and St Anne's colleges, with as many as several dozen students falling ill across the entire university.It is possible that the infection, an airbourne virus transmitted through coughing or sneezing, was spread at recent college balls. In serious cases, it can cause deafness and meningitis. Four Anne's students have reportedly been confined to their rooms, while 2 have been sent home to recover in quarantine. At Corpus, at least 3 students are affected, all of whom have either been asked to remain in their rooms or go to home for a brief period.JC is a 2nd year mathematician at Corpus who has contracted mumps and is sitting exams this term. Speaking to Cherwell, he said: ""How I got mumps is a mystery, as the incubation time is between 2--3 weeks."" Although the ""the college has been supportive and useful"" by rearranging tutorials and relaxing deadlines, he said, he is concerned about upcoming examinations. He added that he ""can't really work, and as it's a viral infection, you can only treat the symptoms.""A post on the Corpus Christi College Cricket Club Facebook page announced that the St Anne's side had had to concede this week's scheduled match ""[D]ue to an outbreak of mumps and food poisoning.""According to JB, a 2nd year at Corpus, feeling in college was relatively jovial. He told Cherwell: ""Oddly enough people really don't seem to be that worried about it at all. It's more of a cause for humour than a genuine cause for concern.""Speaking exclusively to Cherwell, St Anne's JCR [junior common room] president Pranay Shah said: ""'The mumps outbreak around a few Oxford colleges is a pretty terrible coincidence with finals, prelims and other exams for the majority of students, but the response from staff has been very helpful. As well as warning people of the [infection] methods and symptoms, advice from the NHS [National Health Service] and college nurse has been provided too.""One student who has contracted mumps told Cherwell: ""The 1st I heard about it, someone I knew caught it and had been shipped home. ""Then one evening I got sharp pains in the corner of my jaw which were pretty uncomfortable but I didn't think much of it. Overnight, I was pretty feverish. I woke up the next day with my face all swollen up on the right hand side. I went to the doctor who confirmed it was mumps, so College told me to stay in my room in quarantine or go home. ""College have been pretty good about it -- they moved me to a room with en-suite so I could be a bit more comfortable, and the nurse has been around to check on me, but I'm not allowed to use kitchens or communal bathrooms. The first couple of days of infection were pretty grim, I was really weak, walking to Jericho meant I had to sleep for almost the rest of the day, and everything ached. I had dizziness, headaches and a high temperature, and a large swelling around the back of my jawbone.""Both the Oxford University health guidelines and NHS website recommend that people entering higher education for the 1st time have the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. In 2010, a similar outbreak saw 41 students contract mumps. Students with symptoms are advised to seek medical assistance.[byline: Felix Pope]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the United Kingdom can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>]******USA---[2] Hawaii Date: Fri 2 Jun 2017 8:27 amSource: SFGate [edited]<http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Hawaii-urges-resident-to-get-mumps-vaccination-as-11190915.php>Hawaii officials are urging all residents born in or after 1957 to get a mumps vaccination if they haven't already done so.The state Health Department announced [Thu 1 Jun 2017] that 16 additional people have mumps, which brings the state's yearly total to 81 cases. The total is more than double the number of cases in the last 10 years combined, Hawaii News Now reported (<http://bit.ly/2rsry4g> ). The state had just 10 mumps cases last year [2016], 4 in 2015 and one in 2014.Anyone without evidence of immunity to mumps should receive at least one vaccine dose, health department officials said.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Hawaii is following the same trend of increased mumps activity seen in the continental US. - Mod.LK]******[3] Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State UniversityDate: Wed 31 May 2017Source: Contagion Live [edited]<http://www.contagionlive.com/news/mumps-outbreak-at-penn-state-infects-more-than-80-individuals>Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) has reported that the mumps outbreak that started in late January 2017 had reached 77 cases in April [2017]. More recently, a local Pennsylvania news outlet, Lancaster Online, reported that, as of 15 May [2017], the case count had reached 86.Although a majority of those who were infected during the ongoing outbreak have recovered, new cases are continuously popping up around campus. In addition, the University Health Services (UHS) urges all those who present with mumps-like signs and symptoms not attend large social functions, so as to control the spread of the outbreak. The UHS also recommends all who have come in close contact with infected individuals ""avoid large social activities, especially where food or drinks are shared or where the virus can be passed through saliva exposure, even if they are not showing symptoms,"" since symptoms usually arise around 16 days after exposure.Infected individuals usually present with ""puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw,"" due to swelling of the salivary glands. Other symptoms include fever, muscle ache, headache, and loss of appetite.According to the Penn State's immunization recommendations, most students, including those living on and off campus, whether they are new, returning, or transfer students, are expected to receive 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, or submit results from a blood test proving immunity, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Students exempt from this requirement include exchange students, non-degree-seeking students, World Campus students, and those CDC recommends not to receive the vaccine, including pregnant women, anyone with previous allergies to the vaccine, and anyone with life-threatening allergy against neomycin. In addition, the CDC recommends individuals with certain chronic diseases inform their physician of their conditions prior to receiving vaccination.A Penn State press release reports that ""most of the confirmed mumps cases are in students who received the CDC-recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine;"" however, UHS still recommends those who have not received the vaccine or who are not immune to mumps - through previous infection - schedule an appointment with UHS or their primary care physician to be vaccinated ""immediately.""Commenting on the ongoing outbreak at Penn State, Shelley Haffner, infectious disease manager at UHS, said, ""While many students who contracted mumps earlier this semester are no longer infectious, we are still continuing to see several new cases each week on campus... It is important that everyone take steps not only to protect themselves from possible exposure, but also to prevent exposing others should they develop symptoms.""In light of this ongoing outbreak, Penn State will ""exclude"" anyone who does not provide proof of immunity from campus for the duration of 26 days if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Individuals who have presented with mumps-like symptoms have been placed in isolation based on protocols and recommendations from the CDC and the Pennsylvania Department of Health. In addition, several students have left campus ""during the infectious phase of the illness."" UHS has reached out to individuals who may have contracted infection and have already taken necessary steps to exclude those who have been identified as contacts of confirmed cases from the university campus.[byline: Sarah Anwar]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>]******[4] California, Los Angeles CountyDate: Thu 1 June 2017 4:57 PM PDTSource: Los Angeles Daily News [edited]<http://www.dailynews.com/health/20170601/mumps-outbreak-declared-in-la-county-after-more-than-40-diagnoses>More than 40 people in Los Angeles County and surrounding regions have been diagnosed with mumps, prompting public health officials [Thu 1 Jun 2017] to declare an outbreak and issue an alert to physicians and providers to be aware of it.In the alert, public health officials said many of the cases were initially misdiagnosed and there was a reliance of using false negative results. It's unclear when this occurred. Health officials also did not release the conditions of those who were diagnosed. A response from Los Angeles County public health officials was not immediately forthcoming [Thu 1 Jun 2017].But health officials said most of the patients are men who have sex with men, and the majority of the cases were linked to patients being at large venues such as gyms, bars, theaters and nightclubs. Some of the patients are women and heterosexual men who have social connections to men who have sex with men, health officials noted. ""The majority of cases have had no documentation of complete vaccination; however, some cases were fully vaccinated,"" according to the alert.Mumps is highly infectious and spreads among those living in close quarters or at social settings. In March [2017], 7 men in LA County were diagnosed with mumps as part of 2 different clusters and occurred in men who have sex with men. It was unclear if those cases were related to the recent outbreak. ""A major factor contributing to outbreaks of mumps is being in a crowded environment,"" according to the alert. ""Also, certain behaviors that result in exchanging saliva, such as kissing or sharing utensils, cups, lipstick or cigarettes, may increase the spread of the virus.""Symptoms include fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of appetite, a low-grade fever and swelling of the salivary glands, according to health experts. In adult men, mumps can sometimes lead to sterility.Nationwide, 2570 people have been diagnosed with mumps from January to April of this year [2017], according to the federal CDC. The agency reports that mumps is no longer common in the United States, but some outbreaks have been reported. Last year [2016], there were 5833 cases. ""Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting,"" according to CDC. ""Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 per cent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.""Mumps patients are contagious from 2 days before through 5 days after onset, according to CDC. Public health officials said routine vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease. California requires that all children entering kindergarten receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. As of 1 July 2016, only children with medical proof can be exempt.[byline: Susan Abram]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/214>.]
