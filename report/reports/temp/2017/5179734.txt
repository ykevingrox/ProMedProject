MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2017;66:713-717. ------------------------------------On [10 Apr 2017], the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified about a suspected measles case. The patient was a hospitalized child aged 25 months who was evaluated for fever and rash, with onset on [8 Apr 2017]. The child had no history of receipt of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and no travel history or known exposure to measles. On [11 Apr 2017], MDH received a report of a 2nd hospitalized, unvaccinated child, aged 34 months, with an acute febrile rash illness with onset on [10 Apr 2017]. The second patient's sibling, aged 19 months, who had also not received MMR vaccine, had similar symptoms, with rash onset on [30 Mar 2017]. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swab or throat specimens performed at MDH confirmed measles in the first 2 patients on [11 April 2017], and in the 3rd patient on [13 Apr 2017]; subsequent genotyping identified genotype B3 virus in all 3 patients, who attended the same child care center. MDH instituted outbreak investigation and response activities in collaboration with local health departments, health care facilities, child care facilities, and schools in affected settings. Because the outbreak occurred in a community with low MMR vaccination coverage, measles spread rapidly, resulting in thousands of exposures in child care centers, schools, and health care facilities. By [31 May 2017], a total of 65 confirmed measles cases had been reported to MDH; transmission is ongoing.Discussion----------Minnesota law requires that children aged 2 months or less be vaccinated against certain diseases or file a medical or conscientious exemption to enroll in school, child care, or school-based early childhood programs. Before 2008, 1st-dose MMR vaccination coverage among Minnesota-born Somali children aged 2 years in Hennepin County exceeded 90 percent. However, MMR vaccination coverage rates declined among Minnesota's Somali-American community members starting with the 2008 birth-year cohort. The decline in vaccination coverage was in response to concerns about autism, the perceived increased rates of autism in the Somali-American community, and the misunderstanding that autism was related to MMR vaccine (3, 4). Studies have consistently documented that there is not a relationship between vaccines and autism (5, 6). The low vaccination rate resulted in a community highly susceptible to measles. Parental concerns were addressed by building trust with the community and identifying effective, culturally appropriate ways to address questions, concerns, and misinformation about MMR vaccine. In 2011, a smaller measles outbreak began in the Somali community in Hennepin County and resulted in 21 cases, including 8 cases in persons of Somali descent (4, 7). At that time, the 1-dose MMR vaccination coverage rate among Somali children aged 2 years in Hennepin County was 54 percent. The source of the 2011 outbreak was a Somali child aged 30 months who acquired measles while visiting Kenya (7). However, the source of the current outbreak is unknown, which suggests that additional cases have likely occurred that did not come to the attention of health care providers or public health departments.Although indigenous measles transmission has been eliminated in the United States, the virus continues to circulate widely in many regions of the world, including Africa, Europe, and parts of Asia, and is often introduced into the United States by international travelers (8). High measles vaccination coverage rates across subpopulations within communities are necessary to prevent the spread of measles. The current Minnesota measles outbreak, with 31 percent (20 of 65) of cases requiring hospitalization, demonstrates the importance of addressing low vaccination coverage rates to ensure that children are adequately protected from a potentially serious vaccine-preventable disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Please see the full article for figures, references, etc.There is no escaping the need to maintain a high level of population immunity to measles to protect individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to exacerbating health conditions, individuals too young to be vaccinated, and others at risk in the community. In a close knit community such as the Somali-American community in Minnesota, reported on above, children who are unvaccinated are at risk of developing serious disease even without complications from other health conditions because of the infectiousness and rapid spread of measles virus. One in 5 infections can be serious, and 1 in 10 hospitalized. Fear of autism should be allayed by published scientific data demonstrating lack of a relationship between autism and vaccination. - Mod.LK]******[2] PennsylvaniaDate: Fri 14 Jul 2017, 12:19 PMSource: Centre Daily Times [edited]<http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/article161377248.html>The state of Pennsylvania is warning of possible measles exposure in the State College area. According to acting Secretary of Health and Physician General Rachel Levine, someone with a confirmed case of measles was in the area and visited 3 State College locations, creating an exposure risk.See URL above for locations of possible exposure at Penn State and the Fraser Centre Target store.""If you visited these locations [listed in the URL above] in the late afternoon or early evening of [7 or 10 Jul 2017], please contact your health care provider to determine if your immunizations are up to date,"" Levine said in a release. ""If you have been properly immunized against measles, your risk of getting the disease is minimal. However, if you believe you might have been exposed to measles and experience symptoms, please contact your health-care provider.""The Department of Health calls measles a ""highly contagious but vaccine-preventable disease."" Symptoms include rash, fever, cough and watery eyes, and the disease can be spread by coughing, sneezing and contact. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists the most at-risk individuals being babies under 1 year-old who have not yet been vaccinated, people who have not been vaccinated and people who come from areas of the world where vaccines are less common and measles more prevalent.The Department of Health warns that vaccinated individuals can still be at risk if they received an ""inactivated"" vaccine (used between 1963--67) and were not re-vaccinated, or if you were born after 1957 and received only 1 dose of the MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella -- vaccine.The possible exposure means the Penn State area has faced 2 of the 3 diseases this year [2017]. In February [2017], Penn State warned Thon attendees of the possible risk of exposure to mumps after an outbreak on campus. By March [2017], there were more than 3 dozen probable cases of mumps at University Park. In April [2017], the university was reporting it had investigated 77 cases.""As always, we encourage all community members to check their immunization status with their primary care physician to ensure they have received the recommended 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine, and to receive the vaccine if they have not already done so,"" said Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers. ""Any student who believes they might have been exposed to measles and experiences measles symptoms is urged to contact University Health Services or their local health care provider with questions or concerns.""Powers said that the university's immunization requirements require proof of MMR vaccination before arriving on campus. Those requirements are available at <http://news.psu.edu/story/457337/2017/03/22/campus-life/penn-state-simplifies-process-submitting-immunization> and <http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health/immunizations>.The CDC is reporting that 108 people have contracted measles in the U.S. in 2017, up from 70 in 2016. There have been 3562 reported cases of mumps so far, with 5833 total in 2016.[Byline: Lori Falce]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Kansas (Sedgwick County)Date: Sat 15 July 2017Source: Hays Post [edited]<https://www.hayspost.com/2017/07/15/another-report-of-measles-in-kansas-concern-of-widespread-exposure/>The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Sedgwick County Division of Health report a confirmed case of measles in a Sedgwick County resident.According to a media release from Sedgwick County, there is concern that a number of people in the general population may have potentially been exposed to the person with measles in Sedgwick County while contagious. To prevent further spread of the disease, KDHE is asking anyone that visited the locations [listed in the URL above] to please call us at the KDHE Epidemiology Hotline at 1-877-427-7317 for further evaluation.We will ask you about the time that you spent in each of the locations listed above. If we determine that you were potentially exposed to measles, we will ask about immunization status, any signs or symptoms of measles, and will ask questions to assess whether you are at risk for developing measles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines individuals at high risk as infants aged less than 12 months, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.KDHE and the Sedgwick County Division of Health recommend that contacts stay home if they have a fever, except to see a healthcare provider. Before visiting a healthcare provider or the Emergency Room, call ahead so that the provider can take measures to protect other patients and staff.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of the United States may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106> - Mod.LK]******[4] UK (Wales)Date: Wed 12 Jul 2017, 3:42 PMSource: ITV [edited]<http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2017-07-12/three-new-measles-cases-confirmed-in-newport-and-torfaen/>Investigations are continuing into an outbreak of measles in Newport and Torfaen after 3 new cases were confirmed.In 2 cases, children caught measles from another patient in the Royal Gwent Hospital's A&E department on the evening of [14 Jun 2017]. Public Health Wales and the local health board have contacted the parents of other children who were in the department at the same time to advise them of the risk. The new cases bring the total confirmed number in the outbreak to 8.Public Health Wales has issued the following advice:Children with measles symptoms - which include a high temperature, cough, runny nose, red eyes (conjunctivitis), and a distinctive red rash - should be kept home from school, nurseries and social events such as holiday clubs and birthday parties.Public Health Wales is also urging parents not to take children who appear to have symptoms of measles to a GP [General Practioner] surgery, A&E department or hospital, where they could put other people at risk, without calling ahead first.Parents who suspect their child has measles should contact their GP or NHS [National Health Service] Direct Wales for an assessment. They should alert their healthcare providers of the symptoms before attending any appointment.Measles is highly infectious and the only way to prevent large outbreaks is through vaccination. Parents whose children are not up to date with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine should contact their GP.Adults born since 1970, who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine, are also urged to contact their surgery about vaccination, especially if they work with children.Around a fifth of children with measles can experience serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia or meningitis. One in 10 children with measles ends up in hospital - and in rare cases it can be fatal.The 3 latest cases are in children who are too young to have received the vaccination. This shows how important it is that everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated does so, in order to protect themselves and those who cannot have the vaccine because of their young age or a medical condition. Measles can pass easily between people who are not vaccinated. We are urging parents in Newport, Torfaen and across Wales to ensure their children are up to date with 2 doses of MMR.Knowing that the strain of measles causing this outbreak originated elsewhere in Europe, we also continue to urge parents taking their children abroad this summer to check that they are fully vaccinated before travelling elsewhere in Europe.[Byline: DR Rhianwen Stiff]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of Wales, United Kingdom may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/281> - Mod.LK]******[5] Northern IrelandDate: Wed 12 Jul 2017, 2:16 PMSource: Derry Now [edited]<https://www.derrynow.com/news/public-reminded-importance-mmr-vaccine-number-measles-cases-confirmed-northern-ireland/173802>The Public Health Agency (PHA) is reminding everyone of the importance of getting the MMR vaccine after it was notified of a small number of measles cases in Northern Ireland and an increase of cases in other countries.The MMR vaccine can help protect against the mumps, measles and rubella. Children should receive 1 dose of the MMR vaccine just after their 1st birthday and a 2nd dose at aged 3 years and 4 months. The vaccine is the safest and most effective way to prevent measles infection.Dr Jillian Johnston, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA, said: ""We have had high uptake levels for MMR immunisation, which is why we have generally seen very few cases of measles here compared with the rest of the UK and Europe. However, cases which have occurred here in unvaccinated people are of serious concern and remind us that there is no room for complacency. Although most common in children, it can occur at any age. Measles is a highly infectious disease for those who have not been protected by vaccination and can be caught either through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the patient coughs or sneezes.""For those children and young people who have not been vaccinated, it is essential that they get vaccinated as soon as possible. Children who are not already fully vaccinated should contact their GP for the MMR vaccine as soon as possible.""Anyone who may have been in contact with a measles case and who feels at all unwell should stay at home as this is an infectious condition even before the associated rash develops. Phone your GP so that arrangements can be made to see the patient without putting others at risk.""It is also important at this time of year, as many of us prepare to go on holiday, to make sure that you check that you are up-to-date with your vaccinations. Many popular holiday destinations see higher incidence rates of measles than here so it's important to be protected before travelling. Inform your GP of your travel plans and check your vaccination history in case there is a need to have vaccinations before you travel.""More travel information advice can be found at <http://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/> and advice on MMR vaccinations can be found on the PHA website <http://www.publichealthagency.org/> ...-more--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of Northern Ireland may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/197> - Mod.LK]******[6] Indonesia (Papua, Deyai regency, Jayapura)Date: Sat 15 Jul 2017, 3:30 PMSource: The Jakarta Post [edited]<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/07/15/low-vaccination-rate-causes-measles-outbreak-in-deyai-villages.html>The low rate of vaccination in Deyai, Papua, has been identified as the primary cause of a measles outbreak in the regency, which local health authorities have declared an Extraordinary Occurrence (KLB).Local health agency data shows that 40 infants have died from measles in Deyai in the last 3 months as a result of low immunization coverage in villages across the regency. The viral respiratory infection was found to have spread to the 4 villages of Digikotu, Epanai, Piyakemidi and Yiniboda in West Tigi district, Deyai.""The very low immunization rate has caused the KLB. Three months ago, the Deyai Health Agency notified all residents to vaccinate their infants. Many infants died of measles, which means that these children were not yet vaccinated,"" Papua Health Agency secretary Silwanus Sumule said in Jayapura on [Fri 14 Jul 2017].He said a team from the Papua Health Agency, supported by teams from Deyai and Paniai regencies, confirmed that the 40 infants had died of measles during a field visit. ""The teams have all carried out medical preventive measures so the illness will not spread to other villages,"" said Silwanus, adding that he had reported the KLB status of the measles outbreak to the Health Ministry.West Tigi district head Frans Bobii said mass vaccinations had not been conducted in the district for 2 years. ""The government has built facilities, but few people are willing to vaccinate their babies. People here are still apathetic about vaccinations,"" he said.
