El Nuevo Herald [in Spanish, trans. Mod.JG, edited]<http://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/cuba-es/article125578589.html>Approximately ten people diagnosed with malaria have been admitted in Gustavo Aldereguia-Lima Hospital in Cienfuegos. The condition was detected in Rodas, a municipality in Central-Southern Cuba.""Sanitation activities are being performed. The water esplanade in Damuji river was eliminated and we are carrying on an intense fumigation campaign in the streets"", a nurse from the Rodas Health Center explained, but she refused to give her name to the independent press because of fear for retaliation.""This is something you cannot speak of extra officially. The Ministry of Health, Mr. Roberto Morales-Ojeda, has visited the (affected) province many times during the last weeks"", she assured. Mr. Morales, who was born in Rodas, used to be Head of the local Municipal Unit for Hygiene and Epidemiology, and he also used to be Municipal Health Director in Rodas and Cienfuegos.According to a Rodas citizen who currently lives in Miami, the 30 000-inhabitant citizenship is alarmed because of this event. ""Our relatives phone us and tell us the about situation they are living, but when you look for news in the press, there is no information"", he added.Rodas is known as the ""Damuji village"", because of the presence of the river influencing all people's lives. The river, which discharges into Cienfuegos Bay, is an ideal breeding site for the _Anopheles_ mosquito; which is the reason why sanitation campaigns are undergone in the river.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Cuba was declared free of malaria by the WHO in November 1973 (<http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2009/mal2009_rep_chap5_0040.pdf; table 5.5>). Previously malaria was endemic in the island. An outbreak in 1983 was controlled by rigorous mosquito control (Bisset JA, Navarro A, Marquetti MC. Entomologic study of a malaria outbreak in GuanamÌ n de Armenteros. Rev Cubana Med Trop. 1984;36:385-91).Malaria (and Yellow fever) in Havana was controlled by meticulous mosquito control introduced by William Gorgas. The annual incidence fell sharply from 909 per 1000 inhabitants in 1899 to 19 per 1000 in 1903 (cited from: Patterson R. Dr. William Gorgas and his war with the mosquito. CMAJ. 1989;141(6):596-7, 599). At the invitation of the Cuban Government, the Rockefeller Foundation worked on the island from 1936-42. A full malarial eradication service was created in 1961 (Ortega Fernandez, M. RevisiÌ n histÌ rica del paludismo en Cuba. Rev. Cuban Med. 1962;1(5):2-6).Thus the potential for transmission exists and perhaps a parallel can be drawn to the outbreak in Jamaica in 2006 and 2007 which probably started by migrant workers being asymptomatic carriers. A total of 280 confirmed cases of malaria due Û¬to _Plasmodium falciparum_ between 6 Nov 2006 and 3 Feb 2007 were Û¬reported by the WHO. However, a few spontaneous cases continued to be reported up to 2010 demonstrating the difficulty in eradication once the infection becomes established. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10725>.]
