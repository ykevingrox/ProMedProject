What should the health professionals advise? Data on the relatively rare occurrence of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) indicate a nuanced view of the problem for elderly individuals (Seligman SJ and Casanova JL. Yellow fever vaccine: worthy friend or stealthy foe? Expert Rev Vaccines. 2016;15(6):681-91). Unless a woman has an autoimmune disease or a thymoma, there are no reported cases of YEL-AVD in ages 56 to 76. However, in one fatal case in a 60 year old woman, a diagnosis of thymoma was made only after she was vaccinated (DeSilva M, Sharma A, Staples E, Notes from the field: fatal yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease--Oregon, September 2014. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2015;64(10):279-81). In contrast, YELL-AVD has been found in 22 men ages 56-76 without autoimmune disease or thymoma. All 5 individuals (2 women and 3 men), aged 77 or older, died.On the basis of these data, women prospective travelers between the ages of 56 and 76 without autoimmune disease or thymoma may be recommended for vaccination. Men in this age group are at an increased risk that is difficult to quantify. Travel should be delayed until the risk of acquiring yellow fever has abated. People aged 77 or older should be warned that they are at increased risk and should also not be vaccinated until the risk has past.Stephen J. Seligman, MDAdjunct ProfessorThe Rockefeller UniversityNew York, NYResearch ProfessorNew York Medical CollegeValhalla, NY<sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu>[The advice offered by Dr. Seligman should be taken seriously, and he is thanked for offering it. The challenge is differentiating areas where the virus is present and those where it does not occur. For cities with _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission, this is not especially difficult because it will be widely reported. Rural areas are another situation. Yellow fever (YF) in its sylvan (forest) cycle is dynamic. Areas where dead monkeys are found and reported are ones to be avoided by unvaccinated individuals. However, areas without reported monkey deaths do not necessarily mean that the virus is absent. The risk of transmission to humans in these areas may be minimal, but it is not zero. - Mod.TYThe discussion and decision making is a risk benefit issue. At best, no one should get the vaccine if they are not going to a high risk area. And no one should go to a high risk area if they don't have to. If they have to go to a high risk area and there is no contraindication, they should get the vaccine.  The best data published so far on the absolute risk of AE. is available in M. Martin, L.H. Weld, T.F. Tsai, et al. Advanced age a risk factor for illness temporally associated with yellow fever vaccination. Emerg Infect Dis, 7 (6) (2001), pp. 945-951. (available at: <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/7/6/01-0605_article>).  Of note these data show that there is an increased risk after 75 years. Yellow Fever vaccine-viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) has a case fatality rate of at least 60% of cases, and older age and thymic disease have been associated with an increased risk for YEL-AVD (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6410a5.htm>). Risk increases from 0.4 to one case per 100,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine distributed for travelers aged greater than or equal to 60 years and 2.3 cases per 100,000 doses for those aged greater than or equal to 70 years. but it has only been reported in the primary vaccination.Weighing the risks and benefit of yellow fever vaccination in older individuals (and for pregnant women) travelers is complex and ideally should be done in consultation with a travel medicine specialist.  Given the possible severity of the disease, those who can't be vaccinated should avoid travel to areas with active transmission. - Mods.DK/LM/EP/ML/MPP][See Also:Yellow fever - Americas (31): PAHO/WHO, Brazil 20170321.4916725Yellow fever - Americas (30): PAHO/WHO, Brazil, Netherlands ex Suriname 20170318.4910486Yellow fever - Americas (29): PAHO/WHO, Brazil (RJ) 20170313.4896436Yellow fever - Americas (28): Brazil (ES) WHO, travel advice 20170307.4885297Yellow fever - Americas (27): Peru (AY) 20170304.4879663Yellow fever - Americas (26): PAHO/WHO 20170304.4878531Yellow fever - Americas (25): Brazil PAHO/WHO 20170225.4864916Yellow fever - Americas (24): Brazil, carnival, travel alert 20170222.4856915Yellow fever - Americas (22): Brazil 20170215.4842191Yellow fever - Americas (21): Bolivia (LP) comment 20170213.4834655Yellow fever - Americas (20): Brazil comment 20170211.4832763Yellow fever - Americas (18): PAHO/WHO 20170209.4828737Yellow fever - Americas (17): Brazil, monkeys 20170208.4825553Yellow fever - Americas (16): Brazil 20170208.4824819Yellow fever - Americas (15): Brazil, WHO 20170204.4815997Yellow fever - Americas (14): Brazil, CDC Advisory 20170202.4811829Yellow fever - Americas (13): Brazil (MG) 20170202.4809356Yellow fever - Americas (12): Brazil, human, monkey 20170201.4806487Yellow fever - Americas (11): Brazil (MG) link to deforestation susp. 20170131.4805198Yellow fever - Americas (10): Brazil 20170129.4801425Yellow fever - Americas (09): Brazil 20170126.4794564Yellow fever - Americas (08): Brazil (MG, ES) 20170123.4786224Yellow fever - Americas (07): Brazil, PAHO/WHO 20170121.4782152Yellow fever - Americas (06): Brazil (MG,ES) 20170119.4776143Yellow fever - Americas (05): Brazil (MG) 20170118.4773082Yellow fever - Americas (04): Brazil (MG) 20170114.4766222Yellow fever - Americas (03): Brazil (MG) 20170114.4764991Yellow fever - Americas (02): Brazil (MG, SP) 20170112.4761705Yellow fever - Americas (01): PAHO/WHO 2016 20170110.475350].................................................mpp/ty/ao/dk/lm/ep/ml/mpp"
