In 3 months, 402 484 suspected cholera cases and 1880 deaths (CFR: 0.5 percent) have been reported in 91.3 percent (21/23) of Yemen governorates, and 88.9 percent (296/333) of the districts.UNICEF Executive Director, Anthony Lake, WFP Executive Director, David Beasley and WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus released a joint statement on the situation following a recent visit to the country. Here are some excerpts:""This is the world's worst cholera outbreak in the midst of the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Vital health, water and sanitation facilities have been crippled by more than 2 years of hostilities, and created the ideal conditions for diseases to spread.""The country is on the brink of famine, with over 60 percent of the population not knowing where their next meal will come from. Nearly 2 million Yemeni children are acutely malnourished. Malnutrition makes them more susceptible to cholera; diseases create more malnutrition. A vicious combination.""Amid this chaos, some 16 000 community volunteers go house to house, providing families with information on how to protect themselves from diarrhea and cholera. Doctors, nurses and other essential health staff are working around the clock to save lives.""The situation remains dire. Thousands are falling sick every day. Sustained efforts are required to stop the spread of disease. Nearly 80 percent of Yemen's children need immediate humanitarian assistance.""The Yemeni crisis requires an unprecedented response.""We now call on the international community to redouble its support for the people of Yemen. If we fail to do so, the catastrophe we have seen unfolding before our eyes will not only continue to claim lives but will scar future generations and the country for years to come.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 182825 Jul / 402 484 / 1880In the last complete year of data (2015; <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>), WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
