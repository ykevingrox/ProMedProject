NYOOOZ [edited]<https://www.nyoooz.com/news/kolkata/766237/repeat-chickenpox-attacks-fox-city>This spring [2017], Kolkata has had a virus too many. While chicken pox is a seasonal visitor that keeps returning every February-March, this time, it has struck scores of Kolkatans -- including children -- a 2nd time, which is unusual. Experts say it could either be altered antigens that are making vaccines ineffective or a poor maintenance of the cold chain of vaccines that has been negating their preventive powers.Around 20% of children below 8 years now suffer a 2nd attack of chicken pox, according to an estimate by medical practitioners. Even though less than 5% of adults suffer a repeat attack, the number was still worryingly high, they felt.""The number of those suffering a 2nd bout of chicken pox was very high compared to previous years. When it strikes a 2nd time, the symptoms turn out to be less severe, but it still leaves you weak,"" said Samarjit Naskar, consultant, Belle Vue Clinic.Twelve-year-old Ayush Sen had an attack a week before his final exam 3 weeks ago. His parents were left surprised, for Ayush, a class VI student, had been vaccinated. ""When we confronted his paediatrician, the doctor told us that vaccines always have a 10% failure rate,"" said Arnab Sen, Ayush's father.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. A live attenuated vaccine was introduced in 1995. Prior to that, in the early 1990s, an average of 4 million people got chickenpox, 10 500-13 000 were hospitalized (range, 8000 to 18 000), and 100 to 150 died each year. The chickenpox vaccine carries less risk of severe disease than does getting the disease, and most people who get the vaccine do not have any problems with it.The World Health Organization recommends one or 2 doses, with the initial dose given at 12-18 months of age. The 2nd dose if given should occur at least 1-3 months later. In the United States, 2 doses are recommended starting at 12-15 months of age.However, chickenpox after vaccination has been noted in 2 different situations. The more common of the 2 is a breakthrough infection, which is believed to be caused by a wild-type varicella virus. Eight to 9 out of every 10 people who are vaccinated [with chickenpox vaccine] are completely protected from chickenpox. The vaccine almost always prevents against severe disease. Breakthrough infection is usually very mild, with fewer skin lesions (usually less than 50) lasting only a few days, with no fever or a low fever, and few other chickenpox symptoms. Breakthrough infection is estimated to occur in approximately 2 percent of vaccinations per year. The rate does not appear to increase with length of time since vaccination.The 2nd situation, in which you catch chickenpox from the chickenpox vaccine itself, is extremely rare. It has only been documented in healthy people on 3 occasions out of the 21 million doses of vaccine distributed. All 3 cases resulted in mild disease without complication.Extracted and edited from: <http://chickenpox.emedtv.com/chickenpox-vaccine/chickenpox-after-vaccine.html>.A map of India showing the location of West Bengal can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/323>.]
