E-Pao Manipur, source IT News [summarised, edited]<http://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=3..240617.jun17>The statement of Veterinary Department over the death of cattle in Twilang area has angered Twilang people who have claimed that nearly 100 cattle have already died of Foot-and-Mouth-Disease outbreak in the area.Village representatives of Twilang area came down to Kangpokpi today [Fri 23 Jun 2017] and met the Executive Member of ADC Sadar Hills and Veterinary Officials over the matter.BP Vikas Basnet, Executive Member (Veterinary) held a press meet at Kangpokpi DHQs. He pointed out that altogether around 88 cows including 2 goats have already died due to FMD at different places in the area till now.Basnet said that 33 cows in Irang Part-II, 47 cows in Wakotphai area, 6 cows in Chalwa and 2 goats in Gelbung have already died.He also said, ""Many more death of cattle has been reported from other places but we are yet to ascertain the exact number of death."" Basnet continued that Veterinary Officer of SHADC Kangpokpi Dr John Meigai and his team have been stationed in the area since June 9 [2017] and they have also personally witnessed and verified the death of cattle owing to the outbreak of FMD in the area.Basnet also said that the outbreak of FMD is still spreading in the area in spite of the vaccination of over 1241 cattle by Veterinary Department of SHADC Kangpokpi under the supervision of Dr John Meigai, Veterinary Officer.The Executive Member also drew the attention of the state government to immediately send a sincere and responsible team in the area to examine the fatal situation so as to take up quick measures to control the disease from further spreading.Dr John Meigai said that he personally led a team in Twilang area as instructed on June 9 [2017] and confirmed the outbreak of the FMD while witnessing death of a few animals after 1/2 days.He added that the death of animals due to the disease began after June 9 [2017] and it has been spreading rapidly in the nearby areas.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In a previous publication, dated 16 Jun 2017, Vikas Basnet said that ""the buffalo and cow were more particularly affected and they died after 2 to 3 days of suffering the disease while adding that the symptoms according to the veterinary team are high fever lasting 2 to 3 days, eating less due to painful lesions in the mouth, weight loss, low conception rates, reluctance to move or stand due to sore feet and/or lameness"". (see at <http://www.ifp.co.in/item/1155-fmd-kills-20-cattle-in-kangpokpi>).The described symptoms, if accurate, are compatible with FMD, but high mortality of adult animals due to FMD is rather unusual. In the absence of denominator, the mortality and case-fatality rates cannot be calculated. The diagnosis deserves confirmation by the State veterinary authorities, excluding other etiologies. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1531>.]
