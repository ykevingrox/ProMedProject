San Diego Union-Tribune [edited]<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/sd-me-hepa-update-20170926-story.html>With one new hepatitis A death reported, county leaders unanimously re-ratified San Diego's ongoing public health emergency Tue [26 Sep 2017] morning. The Board of Supervisors must approve the emergency declaration every 2 weeks for it to remain in effect. It was first declared [Fri 1 Sep 2017].Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer, gave a weekly outbreak update, which pushed the death total to 17 with 461 cases and 315 hospitalizations. That is one more death, 17 more cases and 10 more hospitalizations than a week ago.More than 42 000 hepatitis vaccinations have been given as of [Sat 23 Sep 2017] by health care providers and county programs, including foot teams. That is up from nearly 23 000 about a week ago.The continuing rise occurs even as awareness of the outbreak and its tragic consequences, which have hit the city's homeless population hardest, have reached new levels. Health providers and others reported a large surge in public hepatitis A vaccination interest last week after representatives of local government and the medical county gathered on [Tue 19 Sep 2017] to make a well-publicized show of force focused on increasing awareness of and action to stop what has been the largest person-to-person hepatitis A outbreak since a vaccine was introduced to stop the disease in the late 1990s.Meanwhile, the city of San Diego has been busy on the sanitation front. A total of 4 portable restrooms went in at Tailgate Park. Located downtown at 14th and L streets, the facilities will be disinfected twice per day and will be monitored by full-time security. The addition brings the total number of downtown restrooms accessible to the homeless to 22, about half of which are open 24 hours a day. Dozens of hand-washing stations have been installed around San Diego's urban core.[Byline: Paul Sisson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cases in north part of San Diego CountyDate: Mon 25 Sep 2017, 1:10 PMSource: San Diego Union-Tribune [edited]<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/sd-no-oceanside-hepatitis-20170921-story.html>More than 20 cases of hepatitis A have been reported in North County cities, including 11 in Escondido and 7 in Oceanside, according to statistics released by county health officials [Fri 22 Sep 2017]. Both cities, each with homeless populations of roughly 525, are working with San Diego County on measures to prevent the further spread of the virus.County foot patrols have teamed up with the Oceanside Police Department's homeless outreach team to offer vaccinations in areas where homeless people congregate, City Manager Michelle Skaggs Lawrence said in an email. ""The county is doing the vaccinations,"" she said.Vaccinations also are being offered to all of Oceanside's first-responders, such as police, firefighters and paramedics, and to others such as housing and parks and recreation workers who may come in contact with the homeless. ""We expect at least 500 city staffers to be vaccinated by no later than mid-October [2017],"" Lawrence said.In Escondido, officials said the Police Department has been proactive in fighting the virus. ""About a half-dozen times over the past few months our homeless outreach officers have been taking the county people out to do vaccinations,"" Escondido Police Chief Craig Carter said. ""We've been working with them to get our homeless population vaccinated. We take (health workers) out with us because we know where (the homeless) are at and it's a safer environment for them."" Carter also said the city also is considering installing hand-washing stations in certain areas where the homeless congregate.A few other hepatitis A cases have been reported in Vista, San Marcos, Encinitas and Poway. Health officials will say only that fewer than 5 cases were reported in those cities. There have been no cases reported in Carlsbad.The Sheriff's Department is partnering with health department workers in all the cities that contract with them for law enforcement services, as well as throughout the unincorporated county, by offering vaccinations and information in areas where cases have been reported or where officials think there could be an outbreak. ""We're evaluating and determining what areas are most vulnerable and where we should spend our time,"" he said.In Vista, the sheriff's station teamed up with public health nurses earlier this month for a small, pop-up vaccination event in Wildwood Park. About 15 transients showed up for the shots. More such events will likely follow in different parts of the city. In San Marcos, the city said it is taking part in the county's efforts to educate people, and also sharing the county's message on the city's social media platforms.Downtown San Diego is experiencing a deadly outbreak of the virus, which is spread by unsanitary conditions and a lack of public restrooms. Homelessness is a problem throughout San Diego County, and many cities struggle to deal with it. 2017's count, taken in January 2017, showed Oceanside leads North County with 531 homeless individuals, followed closely by Vista with 529 and Escondido with 523.Hepatitis A can be spread by the ingestion of even microscopic amounts of fecal matter, by touching objects, eating food, or sharing cigarettes or drugs handled by someone with the virus, or by any close contact with an infected person.[Byline: Phil Diehl, J.

The fire started around 1:30 am [Sun 24 Sep 2017] morning, at Spring Canyon Drive off I-125. San Miguel Fire, San Diego Fire-Rescue, Bonita Fire and Heartland Fire all responded.The fire was maintained at one acre, but the homeless people who live in the encampment have been using the stream nearby. ""The homeless population use this stream for what most of us use toilets our sinks or showers and bathtubs,"" San Miguel Fire Battalion Chief Andy Lawler, said. The area near the stream was slippery, causing firefighters to slip and potentially expose themselves to the disease. The county has talked about putting portable bathrooms and wash stations in the area but have not done so yet.""This is one of the homeless encampments that we have been trying to deal with over the years,"" Malcolm Gettmann, president of the local homeowners association told NBC 7. Gettmann has lived in the neighborhood for 30 years.Hepatitis A is not a typical vaccination for firefighters to get for their job. City and county Hazmat were called to the scene, but much of the feces still needs to be cleaned up.""We're not talking about a small amount of contaminants there, we're talking about a lot,"" Lawler said. ""We had feces on the personal protective equipment."" It was recommended that the exposed firefighters use soap, water and bleach to clean themselves. ""We did soap and water at the scene ... [we] also have a hose,"" he said. In total, 11 firefighters were potentially exposed.[Byline: Brie Stimson][Wearing the protective equipment that firemen use and hosing down afterwards should minimize and probably negate any risk of hepatitis A. I am not aware of any data that the seroprevalence of anti-HAV of firefighters is higher than a comparable group of non-firefighters. Of note, one description of this episode describes one firefighter inadvertently stepping into a bucket with feces in it. - Mod.LL]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)--------------------------------5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5)1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4)8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3.2)15 Aug 2017 / 333 / 232 (70) / 11 (3.3)22 Aug 2017 / 352 / 246 (70) / 14 (4)29 Aug 2017 / 378 / 263 (70) / 15 (4)5 Sep 2017 / 398 / 279 (70) / 15 (3.8)12 Sep 2017 / 421 / 292 (69) / 16 (3.8)19 Sep 2017 / 444 / 305 (69) / 16 (3.6)26 Sep 2017 / 461 / 315 (68) / 17 (3.7) In the past week, 17 cases have been reported with 1 additional death. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published several weeks ago (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal 20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak is continuing at a relatively stable rate of about 15-20 new onset cases/week.The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the deaths occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM [men who have sex with men] practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. No decrease seems to be occurring in the weekly number of newly reported cases. I would venture to say that 16 deaths from hepatitis A is the most in any US state for many years, let alone in 5.5 months.The San Diego County government is now recommending hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers. The vaccine recommendation has also been expanded to those who work in health care in addition to prior recommendations for those who work in public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters and behavioral and homeless service providers. The county has also set up handwashing stations in high risk areas. Given an incubation period of 15-45 days with a mean of 28 days, the immunizations, as well as increased environmental cleaning and hand washing stations, will take several weeks or more to have an effect. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
