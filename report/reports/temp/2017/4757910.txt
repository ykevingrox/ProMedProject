7News Miami [edited]<http://wsvn.com/news/local/florida-researchers-find-2-new-invasive-mosquitoes-in-state/>University of Florida researchers say they've found 2 new disease-carrying mosquito species in the state for the 1st time.Entomologist Nathan Burkett-Cadena told The Miami Herald that the _Aedeomyia squamipennis_ and _Culex panocossa_ weren't species he expected to find in Homestead and Florida City during an October [2016] research trip. He says it's a sign of environmental changes making Florida more hospitable to tropical mosquitoes.Burkett-Cadena says both species are known to transmit viruses to humans, including West Nile. They lay their eggs on aggressive weeds floating in canals and drainage ponds.Burkett-Cadena says the mosquitoes are among 9 invasive species discovered in Florida over the last decade. Another invasive mosquito called _Aedes aegypti_ is blamed for spreading the Zika virus, along with dengue fever and chikungunya.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It will be interesting to see if these 2 mosquito species become established in Florida and spread to other localities in the state or to other states. West Nile virus is likely endemic in Florida. The presence of additional vector mosquitoes will complicate vector control efforts.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Florida in the southeastern USA can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/450>. - Mod.TY]******[2] New subspecies, ArgentinaDate: Wed 4 Jan 2017Source: Yahoo Noticias [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/identifican-argentina-subtipo-africano-mosquito-dengue-221418749.html>A group of scientists detected the arrival from Africa of a subtype of _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya fever, Zika and urban yellow fever [viruses].Researchers at the Center for Parasitological and Vector Studies (CEPAVE), supported by CONICIT [National Council for Science and Technology] and the La Plata National University (UNLP), gathered samples of the insects in Salta (Aguaray), Misiones (Posadas y Puerto IguazÌ¼) and the Province of Buenos Aires (La Plata). In all cases, they found a genetic mixture of 2 subspecies; _Aedes aegypti aegypti_ (Aaa), an urban type distributed world-wide outside of Africa, and _Aedes aegypti formosus_ (Aaf), a forest type of Sub-Saharan African origin.According to Dr. MarÌ a Victoria Micieli of CEPAVE, this finding in Argentina ""is an enigma"", given that this the only place in the world outside of Africa with evidence that Aaf is of recent ancestry in all the populations of mosquitoes studied. ""One possible explanation is that they have come into our country accidentally via commerce or passive immigration, that is to say, in containers brought in by cargo ships,"" Micieli said.Interbreeding between distinct populations of _Aedes aegypti_ coming from multiple introductions, could raise an increase in the capability of invasion of this mosquito due to greater genetic variability. ""To be able to have a data base on genetic diversity of these mosquitoes will not only be useful for determining the probable origin of new introductions, but also has important implications regarding the rational design of new control methods,"" stated the CONICIT researcher.The work in Argentina is part of an international study aimed at determining the genetic diversity of this vector in 30 countries, led by Dr. Jeffrey Powell, of Yale University in the United States. The results were published in the journal Molecular Ecology.The CONICIT and La Plata National University researchers identified in Argentina an African subtype of _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya fever, Zika and urban yellow fever [viruses].--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[The presence of new subspecies of the vector of yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika and dengue viruses (and who knows how many other infectious agents) is additional proof of the insect's extraordinary capacity for adaptation and considering new habitats, especially if we take into account that interfering with the conditions for dissemination is an important part of the prevention strategies for the mentioned diseases. While it is true that there is a vaccine that is proven effective against yellow fever and a vaccine against dengue is commercially available in some countries, we are still defenseless from the point of view of specific treatments. Thus, preventive actions must be strengthened and carried out continuously. - Mod.JG, trans. Mod.TY][It would be of interest to know if the Aaf subtypes found in Argentina are more or less efficient vectors of the viruses mentioned than the Aaa subtype, and if breeding habitats and feeding behaviors are the same for both. Since the Aaf subtype was found in Puerto IguazÌ¼, one wonders if it also occurs immediately across the river in Brazil and Paraguay, where the boundaries of the 3 countries meet.A map showing the provinces in Argentina mentioned can be accessed at: http://www.mapsofworld.com/argentina/argentina-political-map.html. - Mod.
