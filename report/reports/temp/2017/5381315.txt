Currently, 8 students have been diagnosed with mumps, including members of the men's and women's lacrosse teams.""Our student-athletes' safety, and the safety of all students, faculty and staff, remains our top priority,"" said Director of Athletics John Wildhack said in a statement. ""After continued discussions, and with great counsel from the state and county, we are confident this is the right call.""The men's and women's teams will not participate in any organized activities for a minimum of 3 weeks. This will allow the Department of Athletics to employ necessary measures to help prevent the further spread of the disease.The women's team will not participate in fall play days at Penn State, Navy and Manhasset. The men's team will sit out a scrimmage against Maryland and Stony Brook.The men's team had pulled out of scrimmages against Team Israel and the Iroquois Nation last week.SU's teams have been practicing for about a month. Practice for the spring season starts in January....-more[Byline: Lindsay Kramer]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap/ProMED of New York, USA can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234> and the United States at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>******[2] SyracuseDate: Wed 11 Oct 2017Source: CNY Central [edited]<http://cnycentral.com/news/local/county-health-officials-su-give-update-on-mumps-cases>During a news conference [Wed 11 Oct 2017] morning, health officials confirmed 13 Syracuse University students have been diagnosed with mumps since 21 Sep [2017] and said there are 5 additional ""probable"" cases. Each of the confirmed cases occurred in students who had received the vaccination, officials said.The majority of cases affect members of the university's lacrosse team, which has been shut down for the semester. Students diagnosed have been isolated and the university has made arrangements to educate them.All new students are asked to get the vaccination. Although health officials conceded that the vaccination isn't 100 percent effective, they said it is still the best way to prevent mumps.""Those who are vaccinated will have a very small percentage, will have milder cases,"" Onondaga County Health Commissioner Dr. Indu Gupta said. ""Those who are not vaccinated will suffer, unfortunately, negative consequences. Serious consequences.""Health professionals say the defining symptom for the infection is a swollen gland by the jaw.

But most of the campus community didn't know about the potential health scare until 21 Sep [2017], when SU confirmed a 2nd mumps case and sent out a campus-wide email.In a contained environment like SU, members of the campus community deserve to know when their health is at risk. Clear and timely information is SU's only chance at shutting down rumors about outbreaks before they start.Only those who may have been exposed to the 1st mumps case received a warning email on 5 Sep [2017]. There was a 2-week gap between the 1st and 2nd emails -- plenty of time for mumps rumors to grow without official word from the administration.Even since SU sent out its 21 Sep [2017] email, rumors of class cancellations and student quarantine locations have circulated campus. An official email right away could have addressed potential rumors regarding the outbreak to avoid confusion and misinformation.It's natural for a campus-wide email about a contagious disease to wreak some havoc on the community. But despite there being 13 confirmed mumps cases at SU, students don't seem too worried.That's not to say SU students shouldn't take the threat of this disease seriously. But in cases of future public health incidents, SU administrators shouldn't let the fear of creating panic stop them from spreading pertinent public health information.All told, SU has handled the mumps scare effectively. The campus-wide email was clear and straightforward, and subsequent updates have been consistent. But should another virus spring up, students, faculty and staff should know if there's a contagious disease on campus as soon as possible so they can take extra precautions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******Pacific-----[4] New ZealandDate: Sun 8 Oct 2017Source: Newshub [edited]<http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/health/2017/10/severe-mumps-outbreak-in-auckland-despite-free-vaccine.html>A severe mumps outbreak continues to worsen as almost twice as many Aucklanders have caught the illness in the last 10 months as in the 2 decades prior.The Auckland Regional Public Health Service says 527 people have now had confirmed or likely cases of mumps in the 10 months to [Thu 5 Oct 2017].By comparison, just 286 people caught the illness - which is spread through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing - in the 20 years prior from 1997 -- 1 Jan 2017.""What we have in Auckland right now with mumps is a severe outbreak situation,"" Medical officer of health Josephine Herman says.She said the outbreak was hitting Pacific and M ori communities and those aged between 10-and-24 years the hardest.While about 80 percent of children aged up to 12 are immunised against mumps, Dr Herman says there was now a ""lost generation"" of young people in their mid-20s, who weren't fully immunised.This was because of changes made in 2001 to the age at which children were supposed to get their 2nd dose.National immunisation data also showed only 42 percent of M ori and 45 percent of Pacific children were immunised.""We need people to ensure they have had 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine,"" Dr Hermann said.Mumps can cause painful swelling of the gland around the face and jaw, fever and headaches.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap/ProMED of New Zealand can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>]******[5] MalaysiaDate: Sun 8 Oct 2017Source: The Malay Mail Online [edited]<https://sg.news.yahoo.com/mumps-outbreak-not-caused-haj-pilgrims-says-dept-231700799.html>An outbreak of the mumps virus at 3 schools in Putrajaya since July [2017] was not from exposure to those back from Saudi Arabia, according to the Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya Health Department.Department director Dr Zainudin Abdul Wahab said the cases were instead traced to students who were not immunised to the virus.""These cases have no correlation with the pilgrims returning from the either Mecca or Madinah.""Mumps can be averted if the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination were administered and since April last year the vaccine had been given twice: At age 9 months and 12 months,"" he said in a statement.Zainudin said the cluster of mumps cases was first detected on 25 Jul [2017] involving children from a Putrajaya school.Since then recurring cases at the same school and 2 additional schools pushed the number of cases to 17 as of [Fri 13 Oct 2017].""The patients are stable and received outpatient treatment. They are expected to make full recovery between 2 and 3 weeks,"" he said.""This is not a serious illness and complications are rare but those showing symptoms are encouraged to seek treatment as soon as possible.""Attempts to contact Zainudin on why students at the 1st school were not screened and isolated after initial cases went unanswered.It was not possible to determine how many students at the affected schools were not given their measles shots.Zainudin also said the department engaged the headmasters and student affairs teachers at the affected schools to raise awareness on the disease and health education had been intensified.Typical symptoms of infection are - headache; swollen, painful salivary glands on one or both sides of the face; muscle aches, weakness and fatigue and loss of appetite.The disease spreads via contact with virus bearing saliva on any surface of as droplets released when an infected individual either coughs or sneezes.[Byline: Jonathan Edward]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Putrajaya, officially the Federal Territory of Putrajaya, is a planned city and the federal administrative centre of Malaysia.A Healthmap/ProMED of Malaysia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/147> ][[As has been the case in recent reports of mumps (and measles) outbreaks, lack of sufficient vaccine coverage is the problem. Measles, mumps, and rubella can be prevented with MMR vaccine. CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults also should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination.MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective when a person gets 2 doses; one dose is about 78 percent (range: 49 percent-92 percent) effective.Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, mumps was a universal disease of childhood. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated U.S. communities, particularly in close-contact settings such as schools, colleges, and camps. However, high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. (CDC) - Mod.LK]]
