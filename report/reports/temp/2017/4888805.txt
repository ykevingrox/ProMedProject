The team that will go to the Sierra Nevada is composed of an epidemiologist from Dusakawi, a public health laboratory bacteriologist from Cesar [department] who will take samples from the indigenous people who are found to be ill, 2 Kogui indigenous authorities, and a delegate from GonawindÌ¼a Tayrona.It is important to note that the Kogui ethnic people, due to their ancestral customs, do not permit transport or handling of their corpses, so the health commission that will travel there follows a protocol accompanied by the ethnic authorities and the municipal group of JosÌ© de Los Santos Sauna Limaco.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Speculation about the etiology of these cases is difficult because of the limited and general symptoms mentioned as well as the lack of laboratory test results. The acute respiratory symptoms and rapid progression to death is compatible with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS), but a HPS cluster occurring in a short interval of time would be unusual.ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving any additional information that becomes available, especially results of laboratory tests.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Colombia can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4954>, and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta at <http://en-us.topographic-map.com/places/Sierra-Nevada-de-Santa-Marta-National-Park-2807659/>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16>.].................................................sb/sh/ty/msp/sh"
