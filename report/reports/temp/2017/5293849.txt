EconomÌ a y Negocios, El Mercurio report [in Spanish trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=394417>Yesterday [2 Sep 2017], 2 new cases of hantavirus [infections] were confirmed by the AraucanÌ a SEREMI [Secretarial Regional Ministerial de Salud; local ministerial unit] after conclusive results were provided by the molecular virology laboratory of the Universidad Austral in Valdivia.Both cases are adults, 72 and 69 years of age, residents of rural localities in Collipulli. The 1st of these [cases] presented with intense abdominal pain and dehydration so [the patient] was sent from Lonquimay Hospital to Victoria and from there to the Talcahuano [BÌ o-BÌ o region] Hospital, where the individual remains hospitalized.The 2nd patient went to the Collipulli Hospital on Wed 30 Aug 2017 with a clinical picture of fever, headache, and sore throat, and from there was taken to the Guillermo Grant Benavente Hospital in ConcepciÌ n [BÌ o-BÌ o region], where treatment was given.The Health SEREMI epidemiology and zoonoses team is in the process of investigation in order to determine the place that was the probable focus of infection. With these results, the number of infections climbs to 12 so far this year [2017].[Byline: Silvana SaldÌ as]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the 2 individuals might have acquired their hantavirus infections, the investigations in the locality of their likely exposure should provide additional information. Their infections may have been acquired by exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the AraucanÌ a region and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/y7c7tnhg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14887>. - Mod.TY]
