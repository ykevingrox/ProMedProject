a subscriber whose identity is known to ProMED-mail, but who prefers to remain unnamed [edited]Staph [infection], injectable cortisone, Louisville, KY. I have a friend currently in isolation receiving IV antibiotics after receiving cortisone injections in both knees and her spine. Only one knee was infected. She observed her doctor administering all injections using individual vials and new syringes. I have been told that this is occurring in other parts of the city, and suspect an emerging outbreak due to errors at the compounding pharmacy. I am unaware of which pharmacy produced the solution.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Intra-articular injection of drugs for treatment of inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disease is a common practice and can result in septic arthritis, especially following the intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid. _Staphylococcus aureus_ is a common pathogen in these circumstances. However, corticosteroids are immunosuppressive drugs that could allow organisms that rarely cause infection to become pathogens. The incidence of septic arthritis following intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid is thought to be low, but outbreaks have occurred related to lapses in aseptic technique or injection of contaminated solutions. For example, a large outbreak of fungal infection occurred in 2012 in the U.S. that was due to use of contaminated glucocorticoid medication (preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate) from a single compounding pharmacy; over 750 cases of infection and over 60 deaths were identified in 20 states (1). More than 13 000 persons were exposed, most having been exposed through epidural, spinal, or paraspinal injections of the contaminated medication, but 1648 patients were exposed through peripheral-joint or other injections and of these, 32 had septic fungal arthritis after a peripheral-joint injection.ProMED-mail recently posted a report of an outbreak described in an MMWR report that involved multiple breaks in infection control procedures required to safeguard injection practices (2,3). This outbreak occurred in an office-based outpatient setting where scrutiny may not be as intense as in hospitals (4,5). A 2010 study to identify the current injection practices of clinicians in both the hospital and the non-hospital settings in the U.S. found a small, but disturbing, percentage of health care providers who were not complying with recommended practices (6).1.
