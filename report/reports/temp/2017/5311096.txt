The Daily Telegraph [edited]<http://tinyurl.com/y8vlp7ns>The hepatitis A outbreak in Sydney has worsened with another 5 people diagnosed with the infection. NSW Health is investigating the cause of the outbreak which now stands at a total of 17 people diagnosed with the disease.Hepatitis A is usually only picked up by Australians while they're travelling overseas, with locally acquired cases considered highly unusual. None of these latest people to be diagnosed left Australia in the weeks before they fell ill. NSW Health is working with NSW Food Authority to investigate the outbreak to try to identify the food the people ate in the 50 days before they fell ill in a bid to find a common source of the infections. The incubation period is [up to - Mod.LL] 6 weeks.Dr Vicky Sheppeard, Director Communicable Diseases with NSW Health said more people are expected to fall ill in the outbreak, with 3 people so sick they had to be hospitalized. ""If people think they might have the symptoms they should go to the GP [general practitioner] and they should be very careful with hand washing and not prepare food for other people,"" she said.Travelers to high-risk countries and anyone at higher risk of infection, including gay men, injecting drug users, sewerage workers, and childcare workers, should ensure that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A. People at high risk of infection including travellers and childcare workers are advised to get the hepatitis A vaccine. 2 doses of vaccine prevent infection and is available through GPs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED thanks Keira Glasgow for this additional information. With the molecular typing of the virus in this NSW cluster being similar to that in the large European cluster in MSM, it is possible that the strain was introduced related to the summertime gay pride event in Spain. Whether local transmission was related in MSM or other high risk factors is, as yet, unclear in a majority of the cases. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/284>.]
