Jordbruksaktuellt [in Swedish, machine trans., edited]<http://www.ja.se/artikel/55124/salami-barare-av-ovanlig-salmonella.html>A total of 30 cases of the unusual _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium MLVA 3-19-11-N-311 have been reported since the end of August 2017. At first, the source of infection was unknown, but now the investigation has found links to a special salami, fuet and smoked fuet of the Zeta brand.So far, 18 people of the total 30 infected have been interviewed and all but one have eaten from the aforementioned product. This has led Di Luca & Di Luca to recall the product.Those who have fallen ill have done so between [30 Aug 2017] and [11 Sep 2017]. However, since the salami concerned has a long shelf life, more cases may occur if customers are not met by the information. The products have been sold to Ica, Coop and Bergendahls.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is likely to be due to the same Typhimurium strain reported recently in Norway. Salmonellosis is less common in the Scandinavian countries. Pre-harvest control of _Salmonella_ in food producing animals as well as control of imported food is the major reason for the low prevalence (in primary production) and incidence (in humans).ProMED would like confirmation that the isolates from Sweden and Norway are the same. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/108>.]
