Eurosurveillance [summarized, edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22718>Summary Abstract:We measured early 2016/17 season influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H3N2) in Europe using multicentre case control studies at primary care and hospital levels. IVE at primary care level was 44.1 percent, 46.9 percent and 23.4 percent among 0-14, 15-64 and 65 year-olds, and 25.7 percent in the influenza vaccination target group. At hospital level, IVE was 2.5 percent, 7.9 percent, and 2.4 percent among 65, 65-79, and 80 year-olds. As in previous seasons, we observed suboptimal IVE against influenza A(H3N2).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Citation for this article: Kissling E, Rondy M, I-MOVE/I-MOVE+ study team.

Comparing to individuals unvaccinated in the current and 4 prior seasons, effectiveness was 24 percent for current and 3-4 prior doses, 61 percent for current and 1-2 prior doses, 42 percent for only current vaccination, and 58 percent for 3-4 prior doses. This suggests moderate effectiveness for different combinations of vaccination in the current and prior seasons.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Citation for this article: Castilla J, Navascues A, Casado I, Diaz-Gonzalez J, Perez-Garcia A, Fernandino L, Martinez-Baz I, Aguinaga A, Pozo F, Ezpeleta C, Primary Health Care Sentinel Network, Network for Influenza Surveillance in Hospitals of Navarre.
