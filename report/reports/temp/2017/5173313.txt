Lassa feverPlease note that the data reflect the routine reports, that is, all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases1.1. 9 suspected cases of Lassa fever with 7 Laboratory confirmed and 2 deaths (CFR, 22. 22 percent) were reported from 5 LGAs [local government areas] (4 states: Bauchi - 1, Edo - 1, Ondo - 6, Ogun - 1) in week 25, 2017 [week ending 23 Jun 2017] compared with 2 suspected cases from 2 LGAs (2 states) at the same period in 2016.1.2. Laboratory results of the 9 suspected cases were 7 positives (Edo - 1 and Ondo - 6) and 2 pending (Bauchi - 1 and Ogun - 1).1.3. Between weeks 1 and 25 (2017) [1 Jan-23 Jun 2017], 317 suspected Lassa fever cases with 76 laboratory confirmed cases and 52 deaths (CFR, 16.40 percent) from 63 LGAs (22 states) were reported compared with 744 suspected cases with 72 laboratory confirmed cases and 87 deaths (CFR, 11.69 percent) from 126 LGAs (27 states) during the same period in 2016 (Figure 1).1.4. Between weeks 1 and 52 2016 [1 Jan-30 Dec 2016], 921 suspected Lassa fever cases with 109 laboratory confirmed cases and 119 deaths (CFR, 12.92 percent) from 144 LGAs (28 states and FCT [Federal Capital Territory]) were reported compared with 430 suspected cases with 25 laboratory confirmed cases and 40 deaths (CFR, 9.30 percent) from 37 LGAs (14 states and FCT) during the same period in 2015 (Figure 2).1.5. Investigation and active case search ongoing in affected states with coordination of response activities by the NCDC with support from partners.1.5.1. National Lassa Fever Working Group meeting and weekly National Surveillance and Outbreak Response meeting on-going at NCDC to keep abreast of the current Lassa fever situation in the country.1.5.2. Response materials for VHFs [viral haemorrhagic fevers] prepositioned across the country by NCDC at the beginning of the dry season.1.5.3. New VHF guidelines have been developed by the NCDC (Interim National Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Preparedness guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures for Lassa fever management).1.5.4. Ongoing reclassification of reported Lassa fever cases.1.5.5. Ongoing review of the variables for case-based surveillance for VHF.1.5.6. VHF case-based forms completed by affected states are being entered into the new VHF management system. This system allows for the creation of a VHF database for the country.1.5.7. NCDC team sent to Edo State to support Lassa fever data harmonization & Updating of VHF case-based management database.1.5.8. Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment/isolation centres across the states with Ribavirin and necessary supportive management also instituted.1.5.9. Onsite support was earlier provided to Ogun, Nasarawa, Taraba, Ondo, and Borno states by the NCDC and partners.1.5.10. Offsite support provided by NCDC/partners in all affected states1.5.11. NCDC and partners are providing onsite support in Ondo state1.5.12. States are enjoined to intensify surveillance and promote Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in health facilities.Figure 1: Map of Nigeria showing areas affected by Lassa fever, week 1- 25, 2016 & 2017Figure 2: Map of Nigeria showing areas affected by Lassa fever, week 1 - 53, 2015 and week 1 - 52, 2016Table of cases by state, cumulative data weeks 1-25 [1 Jan-23 Jun 2017]:State: Cases / Laboratory confirmed / DeathsAdamawa: 6 / 0 / 2Akwa Ibom 1 / 1 / 0Bauchi: 10 / 3 / 3Cross River: 7 / 0 / 1Ebonyi: 4 / 1 / 1Edo: 123 / 29 / 9Enugu: 1 / 1 / 1FCT: 2 / 0 / 0Gombe: 15 / 0 / 1Jigawa: 1 / 0 / 0Kadun: 1 / 0 / 0Kano: 23 / 2 / 10Katsina: 3 / 0 / 0Kebbi: 1 / 0 / 1Kogi: 3 / 1 / 1Nasarawa: 28 / 6 / 2Ogun: 10 / 1 / 0Ondo: 13 / 6 / 2Plateau: 10 / 5 / 6Rivers: 6 / 1 / 0Taraba: 38 / 12 / 9Yobe: 1 / 0 / 1317 76 52Total: 317 / 76 / 52--Communicated by:Olutayo Olajide BabalobiLecturer and Consultant Epizootiologist(One Health, Participatory Epizootiology and Veterinary ICT Research Group)Department of Veterinary Public Health and Preventive MedicineFaculty of Veterinary MedicineUniversity of IbadanIbadan, Nigeria<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>[Over the 2 weeks prior to 7 Jul 2017, there have been 19 new cases, 12 new confirmed 3 new deaths. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.Images of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Once again, ProMED thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
