G1 [in Portuguese, machine trans., edited]<http://tinyurl.com/y975om2a>The 1st case of death from spotted fever in the city this year [2017] has confirmed this [Tue 29 Aug 2017]. The victim, a 48-year-old housekeeper who lived and worked in a small farm in Praia dos Namorados neighborhood [Americana, SÌ£o Paulo], died on 10 Aug 2017, a day after being admitted to the Dr Waldemar Tebaldi Municipal Hospital.According to the Epidemiological Surveillance of the municipality, the caretaker began to present symptoms such as fever, headache, diarrhea, and muscular pain on 7 Aug 2017, but upon entering the hospital on 9 Aug 2017, ""his clinical condition was already very serious.""Confirmation of the positive case of spotted fever occurred after analysis at the Adolfo Lutz Institute, which identified the DNA of the bacterium [PCR _Rickettsia rickettsii_. - Mod.RNA]The City Hall reported that a staff of the Program for the Prevention and Control of Ticks and Scorpions (PVCE) was at the probable site of the infection and conducted acarological (tick) research at the farm where the caretaker worked and also advised the victim's relatives.The City of Americana has released a list of areas considered at risk for the presence of the tick [_Amblyomma sculptum_ - Mod.RNA], transmitter of spotted fever.[The areas considered at risk in Americana are detailed in the source article at the URL above]--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also known as febre maculosa, SÌ£o Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality.When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (a flat rash with small raised bumps) at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric (small and larger red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin), involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.The early rash of this disease can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/y7etygpj>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63102>.]
