Western Cape health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo thanked all the role-players involved in the outbreak response.The department said when an outbreak was confirmedÛ  the 1st action was to vaccinate all those who were closest to the point of the outbreak.In this caseÛ  these were the learners attending the 3 high schools in Stellenbosch.The 2nd phase was to vaccinate those situated just outside of the initial outbreak but who may be at risk of contracting the illness; these are children between 6 to 59 months who live in the Stellenbosch area. The 3rd measure is to vaccinate children attending primary schools in the affected areas.The department said this process would start next week and included all 88 primary schools in the Drakenstein and Stellenbosch areasÛ  with a total of 52 307 learners to be vaccinated.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the provinces of South Africa can be accessed at <http://www.sa-venues.com/maps/south-africa-provinces.htm>, and the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of South Africa is available at <http://healthmap.org/r/00vd>.******[2] New Zealand (North Island)Date: Thu 16 Feb 2017Source: Stuff [edited]<http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/89498722/child-with-the-measles-seventh-case-for-the-city>A child infected with the measles was at Palmerston North City Library on the morning of 9 Feb [2017] and could have infected people there at that time.A child infected with the measles has visited multiple public areas, potentially infecting others.The child is the 7th confirmed measles case in Palmerston North.
