Standard Digital [edited]<https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001245178/city-to-inspect-hotels-as-tests-confirm-cholera-at-weston>A total of 6 tests carried out on visitors at the Weston hotel last week [week ending 25 Jun 2017] have confirmed there was a cholera outbreak. County health executive Bernard Muia yesterday [Tue 27 Jun 2017] confirmed it was indeed a cholera outbreak and is now spearheading a team of 15 to comb the city for other related incidents.Consequently, the Nairobi County government has now ordered a full evaluation of all food handlers in city eateries and hotels in a bid to curb the cholera outbreak. According to health officials, out of 25 samples collected from the visitors who started experiencing vomiting and diarrhea after consuming food at Weston, 6 were confirmed to have contracted the disease.""We had to get evidence that it was indeed cholera and now that we have, all that is remaining is to get to the root cause or origin of the disease,"" said Muia. Muia said that the 15-man task force formed to probe the issue would give a report within 10 working days. This will in turn enable the health administration to take action on those found responsible for the disease outbreak. ""If the hotel is found to have breached the health regulations, we will act in accordance with the Public Health Act,"" he added.At the same time, the health boss has ordered for the immediate inspection of all food handlers in city hotels and eateries. This, he said, was to ensure that they had valid food handling certificates and the members of staff had undergone the required medical examination twice a year. ""Through the validation exercise, the task force will be looking into possible new cases of the disease across Nairobi which if any will be treated immediately. We are taking preventive and curative measures to ensure that such an incident never happens again,"" said Muia. Dr Muia warned that hotels found not to have a valid food license would be closed immediately as they are putting citizen lives in danger. Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has now been urged to ensure efficient chlorination of water and fix burst pipes, which could lead to the contamination of water. Nairobians in turn are being asked to observe high hygienic standards such as washing hands, drinking treated or boiled water and eating food cooked from a source which is not contaminated.Since the incident last week, 4 cholera treatment centres have been reactivated and the county disease surveillance team put on high alert. They are located in Mukuru Kwa Reuben and Huruma Lion's Health Centre. ""Nairobians should improve their hygiene then we won't have a repeat of such an incident,"" said Muia.[Byline: Josphat Thiong'o]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Despite what seemed to be a relatively short incubation period, it appears that at least some of the cases related to this hotel-associated outbreak are due to _V. cholerae_, although it is not clear what test was used for identification. - Mod.LL]******[2] Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi)Date: Sun 25 Jun 2017 Source: Mediamax, a K24 TV report [edited]<http://www.mediamaxnetwork.co.ke/news/340143/340143/>Two people have tested positive for cholera at the Lions Treatment Centre in Huruma, Nairobi, sparking fears that the cholera outbreak in the city could be spreading fast.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest bulletin that there was a 19 percent decrease in the number of new cases in the 1st week of June 2017, which can be attributed to timely and effective intervention efforts over the past months.The UN which also cites figures from the ministry of health of Somalia reported 1979 AWD/cholera cases and 13 deaths between [12 and 18 Jun 2017]. Of these, 337 cases were reported from Wadajir district in Banadir region. ""A cumulative total of 53 015 cases including 795 deaths have been reported since the cholera outbreak started in January 2017.
