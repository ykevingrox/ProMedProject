This outbreak is a reminder that it is not safe to taste or eat raw dough or batter, regardless of the type of flour used as raw flour can be contaminated with harmful bacteria such as _E. coli_._E. coli_ are bacteria that live naturally in the intestines of cattle, poultry, other animals, and humans. Most _E. coli_ are harmless to humans. However, there are many different strains of _E. coli_, and some varieties can cause serious illness. While most people made ill by _E. coli_ experience a few days of upset stomach and then recover fully, infections can sometimes be life threatening.Investigation Summary---------------------There have been 25 cases of _E. coli_ O121 with a matching genetic fingerprint reported in 4 provinces: British Columbia (12), Saskatchewan (4), Alberta (4) and Newfoundland and Labrador (5). The illness onset dates range from November 2016 to late February 2017. A total of  6 individuals have been hospitalized. These individuals have recovered or are recovering. No deaths have been reported. The majority (54 percent) of the individuals who became ill are male with an average age of 24 years.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued a food recall warning for Robin Hood All Purpose Flour, Original linked to this outbreak.

It should be noted that in 2016, there was a seemingly separate outbreak of EHEC O121 associated with flour from a different brand (General Mills). It would be quite instructive to know if the isolates from these 2 North American outbreaks can be compared. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12>.]
