Results of their study, presented at the CDC's Annual Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Conference, suggest that rural residents are particularly at risk for infection.On 12 January 2010, a devastating earthquake killed more than 200 000 in Haiti. A cholera outbreak soon followed the worst in recent history, sickening approximately 665 000 people and killing more than 8000, according to the CDC. Evidence suggests that UN peacekeepers brought the disease to the island. In 2016, then-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued an apology for his organization's role in the outbreak.In August 2016, the study researchers conducted a 2-stage cluster survey in Artibonite department. They surveyed 416 rural and 293 urban households and evaluated residents' knowledge of cholera, sanitation and use of household water treatment (HWT) products. They also evaluated access to improved water sources, which WHO defines as one protected from outside contamination, and tested water sources for microbiological indicators. The researchers compared their results with those of a 2012 CDC study.They found that 59.1 percent of rural households had access to improved water sources, an increase from 43.1 percent in 2012 (P = .02). In the most recent study, 94 percent of urban households had access to cleaner water. However, 56 out 131 (42.7 percent) improved water sources tested positive for _Escherichia coli_. A 3rd of rural households had disinfected their drinking water because it was at the time of the study, the researchers said. Of those, 46 percent had positive free chlorine residual.Since 2012, there was no change in use of HWT products, nor was there a change in rural access to improved sanitation (P = .09). Open defecation dropped from 50.9 percent to 24.5 percent (P = .0001). Those surveyed demonstrated at least some knowledge of cholera because 80.7 percent identified contaminated water as a source of cholera infection.References:CDC.

Accessed April 27, 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to a 4 Apr 2017 CDC report (<http://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/controlling-cholera-haiti-no-easy-task>), since the emergence of cholera, Haiti has reported about 805 000 suspected cases and nearly 9500 deaths. In 2016 alone, Haiti reported 41 421 suspected cholera cases and 447 cholera deaths. These numbers are substantially higher than what is stated in the post.From data published in the last PAHO report on cholera in the Americas (<file:///C:/Users/sml82/Downloads/2017-feb-23-phe-epi-update-cholera.pdf>) on 24 Feb 2017, by the end of 2013 (more than 3 years before the presentation of this report) there were already 690 575 cases and 8346 fatalities. For the 1st 5 weeks of 2017, PAHO reported 1897 cases and 28 deaths from cholera in the country. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25>.]
