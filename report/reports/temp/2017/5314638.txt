CDC Health Alert Network [edited]<https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00407.asp>Rifampin/Penicillin-Resistant Strain of RB51 _Brucella_ Contracted from Consumption of Raw Milk--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------The Texas Department of State Health Services, with assistance from CDC, is investigating _Brucella_ RB51 exposures and illnesses that may be connected to the purchase and consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas. Symptoms of brucellosis can include: fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, fatigue, muscle & joint pain, and potentially more serious complications (e.g., swelling of heart, liver, or spleen, neurologic symptoms).Background----------A person who drank raw milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas, has been hospitalized with brucellosis. Milk samples from the dairy have tested positive for a _Brucella_ strain called RB51. People who consumed milk or milk products from this dairy from [1 Jun 2017] to [7 Aug 2017] are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). They are advised to consult with their health care providers regarding PEP care and possible diagnostic testing. Please note: the incubation period for brucellosis can range from 5 days to 6 months.Recommendations---------------_Brucella_ strain RB51 is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. A combination of doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 21 days is the recommended first-line PEP regimen for RB51 exposure. There is no serological test available to detect RB51 infection. Blood culture is the recommended diagnostic test for exposed symptomatic individuals. When ordering blood cultures to diagnose brucellosis, please advise the laboratory that blood culture may grow _Brucella_ and that appropriate laboratory (1) precautions should be observed. If brucellosis occurs despite prophylaxis, treatment regimens (2) should be selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility results. Please see the diagram below for information [for diagram, see original URL - Mod.LL] on developing an evaluation and treatment plan for exposed patients. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consult with their health care provider.For More Information--------------------Risks from Unpasteurized Dairy Products:<https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/exposure/unpasteurized-dairy-products.html>Exposure to RB51 through Raw Milk or Milk Products: How to Reduce Risk of Infection:<https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html><https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/symptoms/index.html>Brucellosis and Expecting Mothers:<https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/exposure/expecting-mothers.html>Raw Milk Questions and Answers:<https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-questions-and-answers.html>References----------1.

It is still not stated whether additional cases have been identified and how many potentially exposed individuals are undergoing prophylaxis.The following is a recent review on veterinary _Brucella_ vaccines: Lalsiamthara J and Lee JH: Development and trial of vaccines against _Brucella_. J Vet Sci. 2017;18(Suppl 1): 281-90. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5583415/>Abstract--------""The search for ideal brucellosis vaccines remains active today. Currently, no licensed human or canine anti-brucellosis vaccines are available. In bovines, the most successful vaccine (S19) is only used in calves, as adult vaccination results in orchitis in male, prolonged infection, and possible abortion complications in pregnant female cattle. Another widely deployed vaccine (RB51) has a low protective efficacy. An ideal vaccine should exhibit a safe profile as well as enhance protective efficacy. However, currently available vaccines exhibit one or more major drawbacks. Smooth live attenuated vaccines suffer shortcomings such as residual virulence and serodiagnostic interference. Inactivated vaccines, in general, confer relatively low levels of protection. Recent developments to improve brucellosis vaccines include generation of knockout mutants by targeting genes involved in metabolism, virulence, and the lipopolysaccharide synthesis pathway, as well as generation of DNA vaccines, mucosal vaccines, and live vectored vaccines, have all produced varying degrees of success. Herein, we briefly review the bacteriology, pathogenesis, immunological implications, candidate vaccines, vaccinations, and models related to _Brucella_"".Text extracted from the manuscript (citations available at original URL - Mod.LL):""Interestingly, _Brucella_ organisms are very closely related to plant microbes. It is remarkable how the proto-Brucella may jump between the two kingdoms, from plant to animal. _Brucellae_ are classified under ë±-Proteobacteria phylogenetically, which are related to plant pathogens and symbionts such as _Rhizobium_, _Agrobacterium_, and an animal endosymbiont _Wolbachia_, to intracellular animal parasites such as _Bartonella_ and _Rickettsia_, and to opportunistic and free-living bacteria like _Ochrobactrum_ and _Caulobacter_ [32,69]. Accurate identification of _Brucellae_ and differentiating them from closely related opportunistic _Ochrobactrum_ is important for accurate diagnosis [83]. It is not well understood whether pre-existing anti-_Ochrobactrum_ immunity may hinder successful vaccination against _Brucella_. _Brucellae_ are gram-negative, non-sporulating, capnophilic, facultative intracellular bacteria [28].""The most widely used vaccine for the prevention of brucellosis in cattle is the _B. abortus_ S19 vaccine, which remains the reference vaccine to which other vaccines are compared. It is used as a live vaccine and is normally given to female calves aged between 3 and 6 months as a single subcutaneous dose of 50-80 000 000 000 viable organisms or as a reduced dose of from 300 000 000 to 30 000 000 000 organisms that can be administered subcutaneously to adult cattle. Alternatively, it can be administered to cattle of any age as either 1 or 2 doses of 5 000 000 000 viable organisms, given via the conjunctival route [50]. _B. abortus_ S19 has the normal properties of the biovar 1 strain of _B. abortus_, but it does not require CO2 for growth, does not grow in the presence of benzylpenicillin (3 microg/mL equal 5 IU/mL), thionin blue (2 microg/mL), or i-erythritol (1 mg/mL) (all final concentrations), and presents with high L-glutamate use [50].""_B. abortus_ strain 45/20 is a rough strain that is able to protect guinea pigs and cattle from _Brucella_ infection; however, reversions to the wild smooth type has limited its use as a live vaccine [62,97].""_B. abortus_ strain RB51, a rough attenuated organism, was originally derived from a rifampicin-resistant mutant of _B. abortus_ strain 2308 and has replaced _B. abortus_ S19 strain as a vaccine candidate in some developed countries. Strain RB51 is very stable and has no, or highly reduced, abortifacient characteristics [84]. Protective efficacy and immunity induced by strain RB51 is similar to or better than that induced by strain 19 [24,59]. However, although strain RB51 has an excellent record of stability, it is rifampicin resistant to important antimicrobials used in the treatment of brucellosis; moreover, it is still infectious to humans and the exact nature of its mutations have not been described. Recently, it was reported that RB51 vaccinated cattle in the Greater Yellowstone Area in the USA were still susceptible to brucellosis [76,103]"".Regarding human exposures to the _Brucella abortus_ RB51 vaccine, this 2004 report outlined 26 exposures, none related to milk:Ashford DA, di Pietra J, Lingappa J, et al: Adverse events in humans associated with accidental exposure to the livestock brucellosis vaccine RB51. Vaccine. 2004;22: 3435-3439.Abstract--------""_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on [23 Feb 1996], for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live brucella vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 percent) people, including 3 (12 percent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. A total of 7 cases reported no adverse event associated with accidental exposure. A total of 9 cases reported previous exposure to brucella vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis regimens.""Regarding _Brucella_ vaccine strains in milk, this appears to be uncommon and it is not clear if human transmission of the vaccine strain has occurred from unpasteurized milk:1. Miranda KL, Poester FP, Dorneles EM, et al: _Brucella abortus_ RB51 in milk of vaccinated adult cattle. Acta Trop. 2016 Aug;160: 58-61.Abstract--------""The aim of this study was to evaluate the shedding of _Brucella abortus_ in the milk of cows vaccinated with a full dose of RB51 during lactation. A total of 18 cows, 9 previously vaccinated with S19 as calves and 9 non-vaccinated, were immunized subcutaneously with 1.3A--10(10)CFU of _B. abortus_ RB51, 30-60 days after parturition. Milk samples from all animals were collected daily until day 7, and at weekly interval for the next 9 weeks after vaccination. To evaluate the shedding of _B. abortus_, milk samples were submitted for culture and PCR. No _B. abortus_ was isolated from any sample tested. Only one sample, collected on 1st day after vaccination from a cow previously vaccinated, was faintly positive in the PCR. In conclusion, the public health hazard associated with milk consumption from cows vaccinated with RB51 in post-partum is very low, despite vaccination with the full dose and regardless of previous S19 vaccination.""2. Pacheco WA, Genovez ME, Pozzi CR, et al: Excretion of _Brucella abortus_ vaccine B19 strain during a reproductive cycle in dairy cows. Braz J Microbiol. 2012;: 594-601Abstract--------This paper aimed to determine the excretion period of B19 vaccine strain during a complete reproductive cycle (from estrus synchronization, artificial insemination, pregnancy and until 30 days after parturition) of dairy cows from 3 to 9-years-old that were previously vaccinated from 3 to 8 months. Three groups were monitored with monthly milk and urine collection during 12 months: G1 with 7 cows from 3 to 4-years-old; G2 with 3 cows from 5 to 6-years-old; and G3 with 4 cows from 7 to 9-years-old. Urine and milk samples were submitted to bacteriological culture and urine and PCR reactions for detection of _Brucella spp._ and PCR-multiplex for B19 strain identification. Ring test (RT) was also performed in the milk samples, and serum samples were tested by buffered acidified plate antigen test (BAPA). All animals were serologically negative at BAPA and _Brucella spp._ was not isolated from both urine and milk samples. RT revealed 13/210 (6.2 percent) positive milk samples. PCR reactions detected DNA of _Brucella spp._ in 86/420 (20.5 percent) samples. In urine it was found a significantly higher frequency (35.2 percent; 74/210) than in milk (5.7 percent; 12/210), more frequently from the estrus to 150 days of pregnancy and after parturition (6.7 percent; 10/150), and from 150 days of pregnancy to parturition (3.4 percent; 2/60), and they were all identified as B19 strain. In 3 groups, intermittent excretion of B19 strain was detected mainly in urine samples, which confirmed its multiplication and persistence in cows for until 9 years.- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
