Mod.TY, edited]<http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/index.php/cidadao/principal/agencia-saude/27429-febre-amarela-saude-atualiza-casos-e-obitos>Minas Gerais, EspÌ rito Santo, Bahia, SÌ£o Paulo, GoiÌÁs and Mato Grosso do Sul have suspected cases of the disease. The Distrito Federal investigated and discarded 3 reported cases. As of [Thu 26 Jan 2017], the Ministry of Health registered 550 suspected yellow fever cases. Of this total, 455 cases remain under investigation, 72 were confirmed and 23 discarded. Of the 105 reported deaths, 40 were confirmed and 65 remain under investigation. The cases were registered in Minas Gerais, EspÌ rito Santo, Bahia, SÌ£o Paulo, GoiÌÁs, Mato Grosso do Sul and the Distrito Federal that has now discarded all the reported [3] cases. Minas Gerais continues to be the state with the greatest number of registered cases up to now. In order to guarantee the immunization of the population in the recommended areas for the vaccine, the Ministry of Health increased the strategic stock [of vaccine] with an additional 11.5 million doses. Immediately, Fiocruz/Biomanguinhos will provide 6 million doses to the Ministry of Health. In addition, the Foundation, which serves the agency, has 5.5 million doses that will be delivered per the requests of the Ministry. Since the beginning of the year [2017], the Ministry of Health has sent extra yellow fever vaccine doses to the states that are registering suspected cases of the disease, as well as other areas located in the regions with areas that have reported cases. Of the total, 5.4 million extra doses were sent to 5 states: Minas Gerais (2.9 million), EspÌ rito Santo (1.05 million), Bahia (400 000), Rio de Janeiro (350 000) and SÌ£o Paulo (700 000). This quantity is an addition to the routine doses of the National Immunization Schedule, sent monthly to the states, which totaled 650 000 in January [2017].Distribution of yellow fever cases reported as of 26 Jan [2017]:State/District / Notified / Under investigation / Confirmed / Discarded / No. MunicipalitiesMinas Gerais / 502 / 415 / 68 / 19 / 51EspÌ rito Santo / 33 / 32 / 1 / 0 / 18Bahia / 7 / 6 / 0 / 1 / 3 SÌ£o Paulo / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0 / 3Districto Federal / 3 / 0 / 0 / 3 / 1GoiÌÁs / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1TOTALS / 550 / 455 / 72 / 23 / 78Distribution of yellow fever deaths as of 26 Jan 2017State/District / Notified / Under investigation / Confirmed / Discarded / No. MunicipalitiesMinas Gerais / 98 / 61 / 37 / 0 / 26EspÌ rito Santo / 3 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 2SÌ£o Paulo / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0 / 3GoiÌÁs / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1TOTALS / 105 / 65 / 40 / 0 / 32Routine vaccination is offered in 19 states of the country with the recommendation for immunization. Everyone who lives in these localities must have 2 doses of the vaccine during their lives. Also, it is necessary currently to vaccinate people who are going to travel or who live in the regions that are registering cases of the disease: Eastern Minas Gerais, western EspÌ rito Santo, northeastern Rio de Janeiro and western Bahia. [All of?] EspÌ rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and part of Bahia are not areas recommended for yellow fever vaccination -- it is that the people who live close to the border with the east of Minas Gerais are vaccinated. There is no need to run to health posts, since there are enough doses to serve the regions recommended for vaccination.The Ministry of Health this week sent a team of the SUS National Forces to help with attending the patients suspected of yellow fever in Minas Gerais. In total, there are 10 professionals that are in the state, including physicians, nurses and assistants, providing help for cases of the disease. These professionals add help together with the teams of Surveillance of the Ministry of Health that are in the state since the beginning of the month [January 2017]. [Byline: Camila Bogaz]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[One hopes that this vigorous response of surveillance and vaccination will prevent an outbreak of an _Aedes aegypti_ transmitted urban cycle of transmission that could quickly get out of hand. Apparently, there is enough vaccine available currently to cover the populations in the areas of risk. The report above does not mention if all the suspected and confirmed cases are due to spill-over sylvan (forest) cycle of virus transmission, or if some cases are of urban transmission.In EspÌ rito Santo state, 4 national parks have been closed due to concern about yellow fever risk. The parks are: Pedra Azul, Forno Grande, Mata das Flores and Cachoeira da FumaÌ¤a (<http://tinyurl.com/gq72gc8> in Spanish).A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Brazil can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5649>. - Mod.TY]
