Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the past 2 days since the last ProMED-mail update on [6 Jun 2017], there has been an additional 10 cases/infections identified in Riyadh associated with either household (1 individual) or healthcare (9 individuals - 6 healthcare workers and 3 patients) contact. A total of 8 of these 10 individuals were listed as asymptomatic, most likely identified through know or potential contact tracing activities. The other 2 were symptomatic (cases 3 and 7) and currently listed as in stable condition.Re-assessing reports of laboratory confirmed cases/infections in Riyadh, there were 2 fatal cases, 1 each reported on [6 May and 14 May 2017], followed by 30 additional reports during the period [15 May] through today [8 Jun 2017]. Of note, in the [6 Jun 2017] WHO update (posted in the ProMED-mail update of 6 Jun 2017); the case reported on [14 May 2017] was identified as the index case in the ongoing outbreak. Of these 30 additional laboratory confirmations, 15 involve healthcare workers, 9 involve patients, 2 are household contacts, 3 are still under investigation and 1 case (a fatal case) was listed as a primary case with direct contact with camels.So what is going on in Riyadh? How many healthcare facilities are implicated in this current outbreak (presumably an independent outbreak from the one reported in Wadi Aldawasir back in April 2017 (see prior ProMED-mail posts)? Has there been a change in laboratory techniques for testing of asymptomatic contacts? Has the ""net"" been widened with more individuals being identified for contact testing than previously? Or, has the virus changed with increased transmissibility for secondary (and possibly tertiary or more) transmission chains involving asymptomatic individuals? More information from knowledgeable individuals would be greatly appreciated.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
