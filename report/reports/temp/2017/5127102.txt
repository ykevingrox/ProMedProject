AllAfrica [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201706230166.html>The cholera epidemic that has claimed hundreds of lives throughout Sudan's Nile valley has now spread to North Darfur. Nine people have reportedly died and about 82 others have been infected with cholera over the last 4 days at camp Naivasha in Shangil Tobaya locality, North Darfur.In an interview with Radio Dabanga, a camp sheikh [the ruler of a tribe] said that the disease appeared on [Sun 18 Jun 2017], at the camp and spread very quickly among the displaced. A team from the state health ministry established a camp isolation center and prevented the displaced from leaving and entering the camp. The camp market has also been closed as a precaution.The former director of Nahar Medical and Health Organization working in the area, Abdallah Rasheed, reported that on [Wed 21 Jun 2017], those 47 patients, including 4 children, were suffering from acute watery diarrhea and vomiting -- characteristic symptoms of cholera. He said that on [Wed 21 Jun 2017], a consignment of medicine arrived from the state capital of El Fasher, as well as a campaign for health education and water sources. He said the working group consisted of 6 people, 4 from El Fasher and 2 from Shangil Tobaya along with 10 volunteers.The camp sheikh said that ""the medical team from El Fasher is insufficient and too few to cover the number of patients received daily. The medicine in their possession is insufficient for the number of cases."" He pointed out that the medical team sent an appeal to the displaced persons to immediately move any infected person to the center for treatment. He said they are towing the government line by referring to the disease as 'watery diarrhea'.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - South Sudan (Kapoeta State)Date: Wed 21 Jun 2017Source: Radio Tamazuj [edited]<https://radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/17-new-cholera-cases-recorded-in-kapoeta>A total of 17 new cases of cholera were recorded in Kapoeta Civil Hospital in South Sudan's Kapoeta State since [Sun 18 Jun 2017], a senior health official said. The hospital's medical director Mustapha Lokuru told Radio Tamazuj on [Tue 20 Jun 2017] that they received 17 new cases of cholera in the area, 5 of which have already been discharged. He pointed out that a campaign to create awareness among citizens on cholera is still ongoing in the state.Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated. It is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called _Vibrio cholera_.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera, possible - Kenya (Nairobi) hotel conference guestsDate: Fri 23 Jun 2017Source: Daily Nation [edited]<http://www.nation.co.ke/news/26-people-with-cholera-kept-in-isolation-ward/1056-3984940-14rxxrwz/index.html>Nearly 26 people are in an isolation ward at Nairobi Hospital with cholera after they ate lunch on [Tue 20 Jun 2017], served during a health conference that ended today, [Fri 23 Jun 2017]. Three of those admitted are doctors. One other person is critically ill and undergoing dialysis due to kidney failure following severe dehydration. In total, there are 33 people admitted in various Nairobi hospitals with cholera. Another person who ate at the forum, a UK national who is a doctor, suffered severe bouts of diarrhea and vomiting and is said to have flown back home for treatment.The patients were part of the 500 delegates drawn from different nationalities who were attending the 4th Kenya International Scientific Lung Health Conference at the Weston hotel in Nairobi. ""During the conference, some people developed severe vomiting and diarrhea and general ill health.""This happened almost immediately after a meal on [Tue 20 Jun 2017]. Almost all those who ate seemed to have been affected even those who only came to the conference on [Tue 20 Jun 2017], when it was being opened,"" Dr Joseph Aluoch, who was the chairman of the Conference Organizing Committee, said. He said the symptoms were ""consistent with cholera"".Dr Aluoch said the source of the infection is suspected to have been from a ""packed lunch which contained fish"", which may have been contaminated with the cholera bacterium. Dr Aluoch added: ""As a doctor, it's clear to me the symptoms are consistent with cholera. We don't need to wait for any culture report before we start treating them for cholera..""This differs from the position held by the Health ministry that the diarrhea and vomiting were due to food poisoning and ruled out cholera, which was suspected by most of the delegates who are health practitioners. Instead, the ministry today [Fri 23 Jun 2017] said it would not settle for the cholera diagnosis until it was confirmed in the laboratory.[Byline: Eunice Kilonzo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There remain conflicting reports regarding the number of patients affected and whether the diagnosis of cholera has been confirmed. That ""This happened almost immediately after a meal..."" could suggest that the illness is not cholera as the incubation period for symptoms to occur is generally 2-3 days after exposure. - Mod.LL]******Asia[4] Cholera - Pakistan (Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province)Date: Tue 20 Jun 2017Source: Pakistan Observer [edited]<http://pakobserver.net/16-family-affected-cholera/>A total of 16 members of a family have been affected by cholera in Orsoon area of Chitral. Members of the affected family told this correspondent on telephone that 16 members of the family, including women and children, have been affected due to cholera starting [Mon 19 Jun 2017] night. They said there are no healthcare facilities in their area and that the Pakistan Army personnel have provided them medicines, but their situation is deteriorating further. They wanted the provincial government to make arrangements for their treatment in the hospital.Orsoon is a mountainous area situated near the Afghan border. Due to difficult terrain, vehicles also cannot reach the area easily. Seven of them including one child, 2 female and 5 male persons were carried to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Drosh for treatment where they were admitted but there is no electricity nor fuel in diesel generator at hospital and patients facing hardships.[Byline: Gul Hamaad Farooqi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
