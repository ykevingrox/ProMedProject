WHO Epidemiological Update Yellow Fever [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=38561>Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------Since epidemiological week (EW) 1 to EW 8 of 2017 [1 Jan-17 Feb 2017], Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and the Plurinational State of Bolivia, have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.The following is a situation summary in Brazil.In Brazil, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016 to EW 9 of 2017 [week ending 3 Mar 2017], there were 1500 cases of yellow fever reported (371 confirmed, 163 discarded, and 966 suspected cases remain under investigation), including 241 deaths (127 confirmed, 8 discarded, and 106 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 34 percent among confirmed cases and 11 percent among suspected cases.According to the probable site of infection, 79 percent of the suspected and confirmed cases were reported in the state of Minas Gerais (1057), followed by EspÌ rito Santo (226), SÌ£o Paulo (15), Bahia (7), Tocantins (6), GoiÌÁs (1), and Rio Grande do Norte (1). The confirmed cases are distributed in 3 states: Minas Gerais (288), EspÌ rito Santo (79), and SÌ£o Paulo (4). Figure 1 [map. Geographic distribution of reported human yellow fever cases and yellow fever epizootics, Brazil, 31 Jan-6 Mar 2017] illustrates the municipalities with confirmed cases and cases under investigation, as well as confirmed epizootics, and epizootics under investigation.In the state of Minas Gerais, the downward trend in suspected and confirmed cases continues to decline for the 4th consecutive week. Meanwhile, in the state of EspÌ rito Santo cases have increased from EW 1 to EW 4 of 2017 [1-27 Jan 2017] and it will be necessary to continue to observe the evolution of the epidemic (Figure 2 [graph. Distribution of confirmed yellow fever cases by place of occurrence and epidemiological week of onset of symptoms. Brazil, 6 Feb-6 Mar 2017]).With regard to the number of new cases (confirmed and under investigation) reported between 6 Feb- 6 Mar [2017], there were 137 new cases in EspÌ rito Santo and in Minas Gerais during the same period there were 239 new cases reported.There is possibility of a change in the yellow fever transmission cycle in this current outbreak, however, to date _Aedes aegypti_ has not been reported to have a role in transmission. In the states of EspÌ rito Santo, the confirmed cases in the municipalities of Serra and Aracruz -- both close to large urban areas -- combined with the confirmation of epizootics and notification of suspected cases in the municipality of Vitoria represent a high risk for a change in the transmission cycle.With regard to the confirmed fatal cases, 105 were infected in the state of Minas Gerais, 3 in the state of SÌ£o Paulo, and 19 in the state of EspÌ rito Santo. In decreasing order, the CFR among suspected and confirmed cases by state is 75 percent in SÌ£o Paulo, 36 percent in Minas Gerais, and 24 percent in EspÌ rito Santo.Since the last yellow fever Epidemiological Update 3 [<http://bit.ly/2mLw5Mt>] up to 6 Mar 2017, a total of 9 new epizootics were reported in nonhuman primates (NHP) and are under investigation. No new epizootics have been confirmed during this [current] period. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 968 NHP epizootics were reported, of which 386 were yellow fever confirmed and 8 were discarded.Epizootics in NHP were reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Bahia, GoiÌÁs, EspÌ rito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, ParanÌÁ, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, SÌ£o Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins.To date, there have been no reports of yellow fever cases linked to the current outbreak in Brazil in other countries and/or territories in the Americas. However, the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) reiterates that reports of epizootics, currently under investigation, in states of Brazil bordering other countries -- Mato Grosso do Sul (bordering Bolivia and Paraguay), Santa Catarina (bordering Argentina), Rio Grande do Sul (bordering Uruguay and Argentina), and ParanÌÁ (bordering Argentina and Paraguay) -- represent a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.The Brazil situation report on the yellow fever outbreak is published by the Brazil Ministry of Health and is available on their website at <http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/index.php/o-ministerio/principal/leia-mais-o-ministerio/619- secretaria-svs/l1-svs/27300-febre-amarela-informacao-e-orientacao>.The updated requirements for the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) with proof of vaccination against yellow fever are available at <http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=69&Itemid=40784>.Recommendations---------------Taking into account the dynamics of yellow fever spread observed in the state of EspÌ rito Santo, the occurrence of cases close to large urban areas, as well as the expansion of the vaccination campaign against yellow fever in the entire state of EspÌ rito Santo, the Secretariat of the World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that the state of EspÌ rito Santo in its entirety should be considered at risk of transmission of yellow fever.Accordingly, vaccination against yellow fever is recommended for international travelers visiting any area of the state of EspÌ rito Santo in Brazil.There are no additional changes with respect to other areas of Brazil determined to be at risk for the transmission of yellow fever in 2013 and those that were published by WHO through the Disease Outbreak News.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from ProMED Rapporteurs Marianne Hoppand Kunihiko Iizuka******[2] Rio de Janeiro vaccinationDate: Sun 12 Mar 2017Source: Yahoo News [edited]<https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/34622845/rio-de-janeiro-announces-mass-yellow-fever-vaccination/#page1>Rio de Janeiro said [Sat 11 Mar 2017] it plans to vaccinate the state's entire population against yellow fever in response to an outbreak that has killed at least 113 people around Brazil.Although Rio has not registered any cases, it is close to where the disease has taken hold in neighboring Minas Gerais, EspÌ rito Santo, and SÌ£o Paulo states.The aim is ""to expand the strategy of vaccination as a preventative measure,"" the Rio health department said in a statement.The state government said it's aiming to vaccinate the whole population by the end of the year [2017]. A total of 12 million doses will be required, with 3 million already ordered, the statement said.Brazil's health ministry says that yellow fever, which is carried by mosquitoes, has been confirmed in 352 cases, with another 915 under investigation in an unusually severe outbreak.So far 113 deaths have been confirmed from the disease, with 104 more under investigation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[All reports of yellow fever (YF) human cases so far in the outbreak in Brazil are due to spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle that involves monkeys and forest-dwelling mosquitoes in the _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ genera. No documented cases resulting from the urban human-_Aedes aegypti_-human transmission cycle have been reported. However, there is serious concern on the part of public health officials in Brazil that an urban cycle epidemic might be initiated. Active vaccination campaigns in the affected areas are underway. Brazil has an abundant population of the _Aedes aegypti_ YF virus vector, as indicated by outbreaks of disease from dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, transmitted by that mosquito.There has also has been concern expressed by health officials in the USA that should a major urban YF outbreak occur in Brazil, the virus could be transported via viremic travelers to other countries currently free of YF that have the vector mosquito and unvaccinated populations, and outbreaks initiated there. YF can spread rapidly in countries where these conditions occur if once introduced.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TY]
