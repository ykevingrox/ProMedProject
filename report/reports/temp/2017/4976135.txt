Metropolitain [in French, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://e-metropolitain.fr/2017/04/16/palavas-les-flots-encore-un-cas-de-legionellose/> A new case of legionellosis led to hospitalization at the Montpellier CHU [Centre Hospital Universitaire] of a tenant of the residence of La Nouvelle Vague, on the road to Carnon, east of Palavas-les-Flots. He is out of danger, according to the Regional Health Agency-Occitania.In June [2016], 3 tenants of the residence contracted this acute lung infection, with 1 death and 2 emergency hospitalizations, including a patient who had been in a coma for several days.Surveys of hot water pipes and other appliances that equip the homes of the residence have been under way since June [2016] and have been relaunched after this new case of legionellosis.[Byline: Jean-Marc Aubert]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Surveillance of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in France started in 1987 with a mandatory clinician-based notification system <http://www.q-net.net.au/~legion/Legionnaires_Disease_France.htm>. France also participates in the European LD surveillance network (ELDSNet) related to travel-associated cases. _Legionella_ isolates have been routinely typed in France since 2008 by 3 methods: use of monoclonal antibodies, PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis), and amplification and sequencing of 7 selected genes to identify common-source outbreaks (sequencing can be done directly on pulmonary samples, even if no strain is isolated) to detect case clusters that have a common source and then identify their source of contamination (1).1.
