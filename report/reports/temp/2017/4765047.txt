As for the clinical presentation form, the demarcation line between so-called ""hantavirus pulmonary syndrome"" (HPS) and ""hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome"" (HFRS) is getting more and more blurred, since there is growing evidence of a considerable clinical overlap [2-4], proving once more that these denominations, with a persistent trans-Atlantic dichotomy, are in fact confusing misnomers, particularly for the inexperienced physician, epidemiologist, or medical student. Moreover, a hitherto unknown hantavirus is suspected in India, causing both acute kidney injury (AKI) and ARDS, which can be fatal. Of note, the 2 fatal Indian hantavirus cases were in ELISA and western blot ""Puumala virus (PUUV)-like,"" thus probably cross-reacting with a hitherto unknown hantaviral pathogen, since PUUV is not endemic in India [5].Leptospirosis remains the classic contender, mimicking HFRS almost to perfection, even sometimes concomitant with a hantavirus infection, an often underestimated fact [6].Muju virus (MUJV) is another zoonotic contender. It is one of 4 rodent-borne hantaviruses found in the Republic of Korea. Whereas the other species responsible for HFRS in Korea are Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), and Soochong virus, MUJV has never been shown so far to be pathogenic for humans, although we have known since the early 1990s that MUJV (or rather ""PUUV-like"") human infections have been found in Korea.Indeed, the genome of MUJV, identified originally in the royal vole (_Myodes regulus_) in Korea, was fully sequenced to ascertain its genetic and phylogenetic relationship with PUUV, harbored by the bank vole (_My. Glareolus_), and a PUUV-like virus, named Hokkaido virus (HOKV), in the grey red-backed vole (_My. Rufocanus_) in Japan, so far likewise considered as non-pathogenic. Distinct geographic-specific clustering of MUJV was found in different provinces in Korea, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that MUJV and HOKV share a common ancestry with PUUV [7]. A better understanding of the taxonomic classification and pathogenic potential of MUJV must await its isolation in cell culture, which so far was not successful.References:1. Clement J.
