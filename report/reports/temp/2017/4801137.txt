Hence, we have decided to eradicate the disease by administering vaccines to 1.65 crore [16 500 000] kids in the age group of 9 months to 15 years. Although we have decided to hold vaccination programmes at all health centres, child care centres (Anganwadi), schools and localities, some of the elite schools have refused to cooperate with us.""However, D Shashi Kumar, general secretary of Associated Managements of Private Un-aided English Medium Schools in Karnataka (KAMS), told Bangalore Mirror that all private schools affiliated to the state board will support the vaccination programme.Surrounded by confusion, the private schools across the state had initially expressed reservations, he said, but with the health department officials and doctors clarifying the doubts, the schools have fallen in line and have assured the government that they would promote the programme besides convincing the parents. ""Like the parents, initially, we too had doubts about the programme. In most of our schools generally, parents would have vaccinated their kids on their own, and hence there will not be any requirement of vaccination all over again.The confusion is this: Whether kids who had previously been vaccinated should also be administered the vaccine again? Would the 2nd round of vaccination bear any impact on the health of the kids? All our concerns have been addressed. Considering the well-being of every child, we will also support the programme,"" Shashi Kumar said.""While one in 6 children suffers from fever after a vaccination, only one in 3000 doses may experience seizures. Mild fever, swelling of glands in neck and cheek or serious allergic reactions may take place, in which case the next dose of vaccination is given in closer supervision in the hospital to ensure there are no complications. For fever, we normally administer paracetamol for 2 days,"" Dr Gowda said.Dr K Suresh Gowda, consultant (paediatrics and neonatology) at Rainbow Children's Hospital, said the MR vaccinations may not enhance effects if given a 2nd time, but they will definitely do no harm to the child. ""If we take the example of tsunami-hit Chennai, where there were several orphan children with no records whatsoever, they were vaccinated in hospitals based on their age-groups. Another example is in the West when immigrants arrive, say, from African countries, they are vaccinated according to the age group they fall in. In case it is an additional dose, it will pose no harm at all,"" he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A ProMED HealthMap of India can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>. - Mod.LK]******[2] New Zealand ex SingaporeDate: Fri 27 Jan 2017Source: Stuff [edited]<http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/88853859/Measles-alert-for-Singapore-flight>A public health alert has been issued after a 6-year-old boy with measles landed in Auckland.The boy was a passenger travelling to New Zealand from Singapore on Air New Zealand flight NZ281, which arrived on Wed 25 Jan 2017.The passengers closest to the 6-year-old boy were seated in rows 34 to 49.The Auckland Regional Public Health Service warned that passengers on board the flight may have been exposed to measles, as the boy was infectious while on the flight.""It could be another 5 days before symptoms appear in other passengers, but if anyone seated in those rows knows they don't have immunity to measles, they can be vaccinated, and that could prevent the symptoms developing,"" said Medical Officer of Health Dr David Sinclair.Any passengers on that flight who feel unwell should phone their doctor or call Healthline on 0800 611-116 for advice, he urged.People should not go directly to a doctor's office or to an emergency department, because if they do have measles, they might infect other people, he said.""If you feel unwell, please don't visit your doctor. It is important to call 1st, because measles is highly infectious, and people with measles can infect others in the waiting room,"" Sinclair said.ARPHS have attempted to contact people who may have been exposed, checking on whether they are susceptible to measles infection, offering help including further immunisation or possible isolation to avoid spreading the disease.One in 10 people with measles need hospital treatment, and the most serious cases can result in deafness or swelling of the brain.Sinclair said measles is infectious before the rash appears and is one of the most infectious airborne diseases.Other passengers on the flight could also be infected.""It is very easily transmitted from one person to another, possibly just from walking past the passenger with measles, or while sitting near them in the airport gate lounge.""The time delay from being exposed to measles to developing symptoms is usually 8 to 14 days, but can be up to 21 days, said Sinclair.The typical symptoms of measles are:- The 1st symptoms are a fever, and one or more of a runny nose, cough and sore red eyes.- Then, after a few days a red blotchy rash comes on and lasts up to one week. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.- Children and adults with measles are often very sick.How to protect you and your family against measles:- Make sure your children and family are fully immunised with 2 doses of the vaccine. Immunisation is the best protection against many diseases and complications.- Measles can't be treated once you get it. The only way to prevent the disease is through immunisation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Of 16 countries in the Western Pacific commission area, 7 had reported data showing they had achieved measles elimination. The countries included Australia, Mongolia, South Korea, Cambodia and Japan.Potential barriers to New Zealand achieving measles elimination status included the failure to get to MMR vaccine coverage of 95 per cent, and a significantly lower coverage rate for Maori children.Measles became a notifiable disease in New Zealand in 1996 and the following year, almost 2000 cases were reported.A peak of that size hasn't happened again, but in 2011, there were 596 cases, with 280 cases in 2014. In contrast, the historic low year was 2013 with 8 cases, while the provisional figure for 2015 was 10 cases.In the absence of immunisation, the number of cases would be expected to bounce around with peaks every few years, Baker said. As immunisation coverage rose, the peaks would get further apart, then at a certain immunisation level, the peaks would stop coming.(Excerpted from: <http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/80199506/Measles-cases-bounce-but-NZ-still-aiming-for-eradication>.)A ProMED HealthMap of New Zealand can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>. - Mod.LK]******[3] USA (New Jersey)Date: Fri 27 Jan 2017Source: Press of Atlantic City [edited]<http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/health-experts-warn-of-measles-case-in-hudson-county/article_8eed5192-7c8f-5fd4-8144-bc94d7ec317f.html>An adult man diagnosed with measles, a highly contagious and rare viral infection, may have exposed others to the disease in Hudson County.The state Department of Health issued a public health alert on Fri [27 Jan 2017] that warned that individuals who were at several public places in Jersey City between 16 and 24 Jan 2017 may have been exposed.The man acquired measles while abroad and is now recovering at home, health officials said.A person who may have been exposed could develop symptoms like rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red and watery eyes as late as 14 Feb 2017.Anyone who hasn't been vaccinated or has not had measles is at risk if they are exposed to the virus.""Two doses of measles vaccine is more than 99 percent effective in preventing measles,"" said Dr. Christina Tan, state epidemiologist, in a statement.Locations of potential exposure [can be found in the full article at the URL above]. Department of Health officials said anyone who visited the locations during those dates and times should contact a health provider immediately to discuss potential exposure and risk of developing the illness.Measles can cause serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain) in 20 percent of patients, especially children under 5 and adults older than 20. Measles infection in a pregnant woman can lead to miscarriage, premature birth or a low-birth weight baby.For more information, visit <http://nj.gov/health/cd/measles/index.shtml>.[Byline: Nicole Leonard]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A ProMED HealthMap of New Jersey in the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/232>. - Mod.LK]
