This area in the western Waterberg was historically prone to malaria during favourable transmission years, so this is not totally unexpected. Limited seasonal transmission also occurs in parts of southern Sekhukhune. To date there have been 49 confirmed malaria cases in the area over the past 2 to 3 weeks.There have been a number of initiatives in response to these cases by the malaria control programme in Limpopo. The community has been informed of the signs and symptoms of malaria and recommended to seek early medical attention. Also the health facilities in the area have adequate supplies of malaria diagnostic tests and medication for treatment.A vector control intervention commenced last week [week 6 to 12 March 2017] and about 200 homes, mainly along the Lephalale River, have been sprayed with long-acting insecticides applied to indoor walls. Malaria surveillance teams are permanently placed in Waterberg, to detect and manage malaria appropriately. Over the past few days there have been no malaria cases confirmed in this area and it is likely that this malaria focus is coming under control.The ambient temperatures are starting to decrease in the area. During the summer rain period (September to April) malaria transmission occurs annually in the north-eastern parts of Limpopo bordering on Mozambique and Zimbabwe, far north of KwaZulu-Natal province, bordering on Mozambique and the low lying areas of Mpumalanga Province including the Kruger National Park. High rainfall, ambient temperatures and humidity are likely contributing to an increase in the number of malaria cases in the 2017 malaria season as compared to 2016.Odyssean malaria: Tshwane, Gauteng Province and Swartruggens, North West Province--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) was notified of 2 people with malaria from Doornpoort, a suburb in the northern part of the City of Tshwane, and 2 patients from Swartruggens in the North West Province. None of these people had travelled to a known malaria transmission area. Unfortunately 3 of the patients passed away due to complications of malaria.These incidents are rare, but a few cases of so-called ""Odyssean"" malaria or ""taxi"" or ""suitcase"" malaria are confirmed mainly in Gauteng Province each year and coincide with the seasonal increase in malaria cases in the usual malaria transmission areas from January to April.There is no link between the cases in Tshwane and those in Swartruggens. These cases do not represent an expansion in the malaria transmission areas in South Africa but rather relate to translocation of an infected malaria mosquito from a malaria area.Given that females of certain _Anopheles_ mosquito species are responsible for transmitting malaria parasites, an investigation of the 2 residences and environs in Tshwane and Swartruggens was carried out. No _Anopheles_ mosquito adults or larvae were found. There are _Culex_ mosquitoes breeding in the general area as expected, but _Culex_ mosquitoes never transmit malaria. The evidence available therefore suggests that these cases did not result from local transmission in Tshwane and Swartruggens but from translocation of infected mosquitoes from a malaria risk area in a vehicle or suitcase as a very uncommon event - most mosquitoes would in fact not survive the journey.All healthcare practitioners are encouraged to consider malaria as a differential diagnosis in all patients presenting with unexplained fever (38 C or 100.4 F) and flu-like illness, especially in the presence of a change in the level of consciousness and/ or progressive jaundice even in the absence of a travel history to a malaria-endemic region.--Professor Lucille BlumbergNational Institute for Communicable DiseasesPRF Building, 1 Modderfontein Rd, Sandringham, Johannesburg, 2131<lucilleb@nicd.ac.za> <www.nicd.ac.za>[ProMED thanks Professor Lucille Blumberg from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, for providing this important key information on the situation in Gauteng. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25492>.][See Also:Malaria - South Africa (02): (GT,NW): 20170313.4897685Malaria - South Africa: (GT): 20170310.48919772014----Malaria - South Africa: (VH, MP): 20140202.22498172011----Malaria - South Africa: (LP): 20110104.00412010----Malaria - South Africa: (LP) 20100106.00602006----Malaria - South Africa: DDT 20060617.1686Malaria - South Africa (Gauteng) 20060124.02352001----DDT & malaria control - South Africa 20010103.00192000----DDT & Malaria control - South Africa 20001220.22361999----Malaria, drug resistant - Africa: overview 19990320.04441997----Malaria - South Africa 19970217.0388].................................................ep/ao/dk"
