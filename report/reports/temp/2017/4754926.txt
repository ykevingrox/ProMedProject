Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/argentina-3-hantavirus-cases-confirmed-la-plata-35882/>Three men from La Plata, Buenos Aires Province have contracted the viral disease, [caused by a] hantavirus, according to a Clarin report (computer translated). They are currently hospitalized for their illness. The 3 cases were confirmed by a source from Sanitary Region XI, who detailed that those affected had been working or walking in the rural area of La Plata.Hantaviruses are carried by certain species of rats and mice that shed the virus in their urine, droppings and saliva. The virus can be transmitted to people when nesting materials or dust contaminated by infected rat or mouse urine, droppings and saliva are stirred up, allowing the virus to be breathed in by humans.Early symptoms of [a] hantavirus infection include fatigue, fever and muscle aches that may be accompanied by headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath. If a hantavirus infection is suspected, people should contact their health care provider immediately and mention any potential exposure to rodents, their nests or their waste.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There is no indication of the specific hantavirus involved in these cases or previous ones in Buenos Aires province in 2016, nor is there mention of the specific circumstances under which the men reported above acquired their infections. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 5 years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these recent Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, while these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at <http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg>.A map of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.zonu.com/argentina_maps/Argentina_Regions_Map_2.htm>, and at<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/723>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53505>.]
