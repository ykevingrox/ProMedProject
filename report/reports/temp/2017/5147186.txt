Confirmation tests [have been] processed to find the strain but [no answers are as yet] provided. [Close] contacts with the deceased male were screened and provided chemoprophylaxis for bacterial meningitis and a bunch of cases were admitted to the hospital. The outbreak started following a graduation party that was held by the deceased person.An epidemiological investigation is ongoing these days in Brasov.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project members for their responses.In combination with a clinical picture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination consistent with bacterial meningitis, a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial meningitis caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ can be rapidly made on the basis of a Gram stain of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sediment or by detection of specific antigens in the CSF by a latex agglutination test (LAT) <https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt06-culture-id.html>. The LAT reagent consists of polystyrene latex particles that have been coated with antibodies specific for meningococcus serogroups A, C, Y and W135 antigens. These latex particles agglutinate in the presence of sufficient antigen in the CSF.No further information has become available for this outbreak in Brasov, Romania.Brasov is a city with a population of 253 200 residents in Romania and the administrative centre of Brasov County <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braéªov>.
