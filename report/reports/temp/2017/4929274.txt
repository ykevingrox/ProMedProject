A bone marrow biopsy showed leishmania parasites. The analysis was performed at a university laboratory in Cairo. The patient has not travelled outside Cairo.Another concern is that there are new cases in the Cairo area with many affected patients, [which was learned from talking with colleagues there].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The present report clearly shows that there is a risk of visceral leishmanaisis in Cairo. This is new information and Cairo has previously been regarded as Leishmaniasis free. ProMED-mail will be happy to publish further information if available. The review of the world situation of Leishmanaisis (Alvar J et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671. Supplement 28) write:Leishmania donovani DNA was already found in bone marrow samples taken from ancient Egyptian and Nubian mummies that originate from around 4000 BC. Since 1904, rare cases of VL have been reported in Egypt; some were imported, others were probably autochtonous. A focus of VL was discovered in El Agamy, 25 km west of Alexandria in 1982. The last case there was reported in 2005 and only one more case of VL was reported, in the Suez region in 2008. However, due to a lack of awareness among medical practitioners, VL is suspected to be underreported. Import of cases from Libya and Sudan may occur regularly and go unnoticed.CL has been an increasing problem in Egypt [1]. Known foci are among nomads in North Sinai with 471 reported cases in 2008 [2]. In an active case detection survey 200 new cases were identified, confirming underreporting to a large degree. The reported number of cases is estimated to be 4-5 times lower than the real number of cases. In 2010 (until July only), 133 cases were reported. People at risk are soldiers, laborers, and immunocompromised adults. 1. Postigo JA (2010). Leishmaniasis in the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region.
