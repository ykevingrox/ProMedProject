This comes barely 4 months after another outbreak hit the district's 2 villages in the area of Paramount Chief Lundu, affecting 38 people. The Environmental Health Office for Chikwawa district has confirmed the development, citing poor access to safe water and poor quality of sanitary facilities in villages. There are fears that the cholera outbreak may spread to other areas where communities do not have access to portable water supply as well as toilets.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Malawi can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/malawi.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8665>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Cholera - SudanDate: Tue 22 Aug 2017Source: Radio Dabanga [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201708220596.html>South Darfur------------In 2 months, 42 people have died of cholera in Kalma camp for displaced people in South Darfur. 539 others have been infected.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.""The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).""In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).""References-----------57.
