The last case detected in Angola was on 23 Jun 2016, and DRC's last case was on 12 Jul the same year [2016].More than 30 million people were vaccinated in the 2 countries in emergency vaccination campaigns. This key part of the response included mop up and preventative campaigns in hard to reach areas up until the end of the year to ensure vaccine protection for as many people in all areas of risk as possible. This unprecedented response exhausted the global stockpile of yellow fever vaccines several times.More than 41 000 volunteers and 8000 vaccination teams with more than 56 NGO partners were involved in the mass immunization campaigns. The vaccines used came from a global stockpile co-managed by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF and WHO. In the 1st 6 months of 2016 alone, the partners delivered more than 19 million doses of the vaccine, 3 times the 6 million doses usually put aside for an outbreak. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance financed a significant proportion of the vaccines.The 1st cases in this outbreak were identified on 5 Dec 2015 in Viana, Luanda Province, Angola. The outbreak spread to the entire country and to neighbouring country Democratic Republic of the Congo, where local transmission was established in March 2016.From the start of the outbreak, Angola reported a total of 4306 suspected cases and 376 deaths, of which 884 cases and 121 deaths were laboratory confirmed.In this outbreak, DRC has reported 2987 suspected cases, with 81 laboratory-confirmed cases and 16 deaths.One of the major achievements of the response to this outbreak was the introduction of an innovative dose-sparing strategy using 1/5th of a regular dose of the yellow fever vaccine, a technique approved by WHO's global vaccine expert group to protect as many people as possible from the immediate threat of a major urban outbreak.WHO supported the Ministry of Health in DRC to vaccinate 10.7 million people in the city of Kinshasa using this dose-sparing strategy as a short-term measure that will provide immunity against yellow fever for at least 12 months and likely longer.In addition to supporting mass vaccination campaigns, WHO and partners continue to provide support to Angola and DRC to strengthen disease surveillance, to control the spread of mosquitoes and engage communities so that they can protect themselves.Climate change, the increased mobility of people within and across borders from rural to densely populated urban areas, and the resurgence of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito are increasing the risk of yellow fever epidemics.""Yellow fever outbreaks like the one in Angola and the DRC could become more frequent in many parts of the world unless coordinated measures are taken to protect people most at risk. Therefore, we need to implement a strong preventive approach to vaccinate the population at risk across the region,"" said Dr Ibrahima Soce Fall, WHO Regional Emergency Director.In response, a broad coalition of partners including WHO recently developed a new strategy calling for the ""Elimination of Yellow Fever Epidemics"" (EYE) to strengthen global action and integrate lessons learnt from the outbreak in Angola and DRC.Key components of the EYE strategy include measures to ensure people are vaccinated before an outbreak strikes, increase the number of global vaccine stocks for outbreak response and support for greater preparedness in the most at-risk countries.The Organization's response to the outbreak has been possible thanks to financial support from the Angolan, German and Japanese Governments, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, BioManguinhos, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the WHO International Coordination Group (ICG) Revolving Fund, USAID and the Contingency Fund for Emergencies.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is a relief to post good news about yellow fever (YF) for a change, the end of the YF outbreak 1st in Angola and now in the DRC. The collaboration to bring an end to this outbreak has been remarkable. Many lessons were learned, but many challenges remain. At the local level, can high percentages of the population remain vaccinated over the long term? Can active surveillance be maintained to detect YF cases due to spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle before another urban cycle can triggered? Will contingency plans be continuously updated and teams ready to respond quickly when surveillance identifies the cases early on? Will laboratory support with the necessary trained personnel and reagents be continuously available? All of these measures require training and financing. With a disease such as YF, that may occur only sporadically, is not easy because an integrated detection-response system has to compete with other immediate social demands for resources. As time passes, decision-makers come and go, and institutional memory can fade. One hopes this is not the case in Angola, the DRC and other African countries at risk of YF outbreaks. - Mod.TYHealthMaps:Angola: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>]
