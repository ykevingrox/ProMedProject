Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/namibia-reports-2nd-crimean-congo-hemorrhagic-fever-case-65878/>In a follow-up to the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) reported in Namibia last month [February 2017], a 2nd CCHF case was confirmed last week [week 13 to 19 Mar 2017] in the southwest African country.The 2nd case is a 19 year old male residing in a communal farm in Okongoua village, 250 km [approx. 155 mi] away from Gobabis, where the 1st case originated. The 2 cases have no established epidemiological linkage. The case is still in admission and is expected to be discharged in the coming days. A total of 16 contacts have been systematically identified and monitored for 14 days from date of last contact. No new cases have since emerged.According to the World Health Organization, CCHF was 1st reported in Namibia in 1986, with 3 cases recorded. Subsequent outbreaks have occurred in 1998 (1 case), 2001 (2 cases), 2002 (1 case) and 2010 (3 cases), scattered across 5 regions (Otjozondjupa, Khomas, Omaheke, Karas, and Kavango).The current outbreak has occurred in Gobabis (with a population of 72 306 people) in Omaheke region, which reported its last outbreak in 2001. The fact that the 2 cases in the current outbreak had no epidemiological link could attest to the fact that the disease is prevalent in livestock in Namibia.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is an update to the case reported on Promed in post titled 'Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Namibia (02): (OH) 20170312.4895397. The case is improving under hospital management and should be discharged soon.However, this case has no epidemiological linkage to the 1st case reported earlier this year, which means that this is another sporadic incident. Tick mapping in affected districts can be helpful in developing prevention strategies including vector control and public awareness messages. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25624>.]
