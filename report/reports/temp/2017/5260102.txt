The 2 newly confirmed cases from Jeddah are of interest for the observation that they are still under review for classification. The last time there were 2 cases from the same location reported as ""under review"" within a few days of each other was the beginning of the identified outbreak in Wadi Aldawasir (in Riyadh region) back in March of 2017. Looking for other recently reported cases in Jeddah, on [Wed 2 Aug 2017] there was a 57-year-old expat male reported in critical condition who was reported as a fatality on [Fri 4 Aug 2017], having been classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation. On [Fri 4 Aug 2017] there was the 44-year-old expat female classified as a secondary household contact case (see recovery No. 2 listed above). and now, 12 and 14 days after the 2nd case was reported from Jeddah there are 2 additional cases reported, both under review. An obvious question is whether there is a new healthcare associated cluster of MERS-CoV transmission occurring in Jeddah... perhaps associated with either a renal dialysis unit or another mixed inpatient/outpatient facility?....Maps showing the locations of each of the cases discussed above can be found at the source URLs.

The initial case was a 51-year-old reported on [Wed 2 Aug 2017]. To date, 12 cases have been identified through contact tracing. These cases include 8 health care workers (all asymptomatic) in the hospital where the initial case was treated, one hospital contact (a 70-year-old male) and 3 household contacts. Follow up of health care workers, hospital and household contacts are ongoing.Globally, 2066 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 720 related deaths have been reported to WHO.Public health responseThe Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia evaluates each case and their contacts and implements measures to limit further human-to-human transmission and bring Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks under control. The measures taken by Ministry of Health officials in Saudi Arabia include: - Risk stratification and active tracing for contacts in healthcare and in communities. High risk contacts (e.g. unprotected exposure to a case or engagement in an aerosol generating procedure) are tested by PCR regardless of having symptoms. Health care workers are exempted from work until they are cleared by infection control experts. - Trained hospital epidemiologists have been deployed to sites within 24 hours of identifying an outbreak. - Enforcement of strict adherence to environmental disinfection and terminal cleaning of affected areas. - Enforcement of visual triage for respiratory diseases in emergency department and outpatient departments and ensuring the 24/7 availability of trained nurses for early detection of patients with respiratory symptoms, and proper documentation on triage forms. - Extensive training of all health care workers on case definition for early detection, implementation of isolation precautions, proper selection, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene and environmental cleaning and disinfection. - Ensuring availability of infection prevention supplies including hand sanitizer, PPEs, surface disinfectants, portable HEPA filters and fumigation machines. - Ensuring that all health care workers are fit tested for high efficiency respirators. - Implementing the policy of not allowing health care personnel working in a facility affected by an outbreak to travel or work in Hajj premises or in any healthcare facility until they are medical cleared.WHO risk assessmentMERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.WHO adviceBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[In summary, according to the WHO update, as of [Sat 12 Aug 2017], there have been a total of 2066 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO, including at least 720 related deaths (reported case fatality rate 34.8 percent). In the period covered by the above update (4 Jul - 12 Aug 2017), there were 26 newly confirmed laboratory confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV including 8 asymptomatic infections associated with the outbreak in Dawmet Aljandal (Asir region).In addition to the 6 fatalities among these 26 newly confirmed infections, official recovery reports from the MOH were available for cases no. 1 (on Tue 11 Jul 2017), no. 3 (on Mon 31 Jul 2017), no 5 (on Thu 17 Aug 2017), and no. 9 (Tue 15 Aug 2017).Classifications of the 26 cases reported by the MOH included:A total of 8 primary cases with high risk exposures still under investigation (cases nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 20, 21, and 26)One primary case with no known high risk exposure (case no. 6)Up to 4 primary cases with contact with camels (3 direct contact, one indirect contact -- cases nos. 4, 5, 8 and 12)A total of 8 secondary healthcare associated cases in healthcare workers (cases nos. 10, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, and 25)One secondary healthcare associated case in a patient (case no.19)Up to 4 secondary cases in household contacts (cases nos. 9, 13, 14 and 18)According to the WHO update, case no. 11 had a history of contact with camels that was not known at the time of the MOH report.Interpretation of the details above is that outside of the outbreak in Asir region, the pattern of transmission was primarily sporadic cases, around the country, the majority of whom were classified as primary cases with unidentified high risk exposures (8 out of 13) and the remaining 5 cases had a history of known contact with camels and camel products in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. So the question remains, what is the high risk exposure that is not being identified? .......- Mod.MPP]
