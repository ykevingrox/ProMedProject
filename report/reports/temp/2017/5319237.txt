The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene [edited]<https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.17-0396>AbstractHookworm infection affects 430 million people worldwide, causing iron deficiency, impaired cognitive development, and stunting in children.  Because of the environmental conditions needed for the hookworm life-cycle, this parasite is endemic to resource-limited countries. _Necator americanus_ was endemic in the southern United States before improvement of sewage disposal systems and eradication programs. With continued poverty, poor sanitation, and an environment suitable for the hookworm life-cycle in some regions of the southern United States, a current prevalence study using modern molecular diagnostics is warranted. Lowndes County, Alabama, was chosen as the study site given previous high hookworm burdens, degree of poverty, and use of open-sewage systems. Participants were interviewed, and stool, serum, and soil samples were tested for 9 intestinal parasites using a multiparallel quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We found that, among 24 households, 42.4 percent reported exposure to raw sewage within their home, and from 55 stool samples, 19 (34.5 percent) tested positive for _N. americanus_, 4 (7.3 percent) for _Strongyloides stercoralis_, and one (1.8 percent) for _Entamoeba histolytica_. Stool tested positive for _N. americanus_ contained low levels of parasite DNA (geometric mean 0.0302 fg/åµL). Soil studies detected one (2.9 percent) _Cryptosporidium_ species, and _Toxocara_ serology assay detected one (5.2 percent) positive in this population. Individuals living in this high-risk environment within the United States continue to have stool samples positive for _N. americanus_. Gastrointestinal parasites known to be endemic to developing countries are identifiable in American poverty regions, and areas with lower disease burden are more likely to be identified by using qPCR.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is an important study clearly demonstrating that poverty-related infections with geohelminths like hookworm and _Strongyloides stercoralis_ are also found in industrialized countries. The authors used PCR which is probably much more sensitive (being positive with a low egg count) compared to microscopy. Thus the study demonstrates that disease prevalence may be revisited with modern molecular tools. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/205>.]
