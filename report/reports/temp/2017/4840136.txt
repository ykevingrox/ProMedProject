Diario Futrono, Diario de Valdivia report [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.diariofutrono.cl/noticia/actualidad/2017/02/confirman-quinto-contagio-por-hanta-virus-en-los-rios>An adult woman from Valdivia [Los Rios region] is in serious but stable condition, infected with [a] hantavirus and moved to the hospital in Temuco [Los Lagos region] during last weekend [11-12 Feb 2017]. She is the 5th case of this virus infection so far this year [2017], stated the Health SEREMI [local ministerial unit], Claudio Mendez.The health authority stated that of the 5 cases, 2 have been fatal due to the high mortality that this virus causes and added, ""The 5th case of [a] hantavirus [infection] of an inhabitant of our region has been notified and involves a 41 year old woman who was taken to the hospital in Temuco on [Sat 11 Feb 2017], where she is in serious but stable condition. We are waiting to see how she evolves clinically so our epidemiological surveillance team is in constant contact. Our team went [to the locality] to establish the places where she was, in order to establish a certain perimeter of probable infection and indicate to the families there the measures that they have to adopt.""Given this, the SEREMI reiterated the measures that the people must take to be protected during the summer in dealing with this infection that is endemic in the region. He insisted that they must avoid risky behaviors such as gathering wild fruit or going into brushy areas, as well as adopting measures such as ventilation of storage sheds, sealing up houses to avoid rodent entry, maintaining trash in well sealed [containers], and mowing the lawns.The authority reinforces his call to the community, most of all during the summer period, concerning risky activities that people carry out during the summer in areas where the rodent lives.Recommendations---------------- seal up all the openings where rodents could enter with [rodent-) resistant materials (steel, cement);- eliminate unused materials that could serve as refuges for the rodent;- dispose of trash well, in garbage cans with closed tops;- keep stored food materials in hermetically closed containers;- do not keep leftover food, including that of pets, within the reach of rodents, taking them away immediately and putting these remaining materials correctly in garbage cans with tops;- before entering places that have been closed, it is recommended to ventilate them for 30 minutes, opening doors and windows. After that, spray with a solution of bleach (a table spoon [15mL] per liter of water), to avoid the creation of aerosols;- keep open, clean, and free from elements around the house that can serve as food or refuge for rodents;- clear out weeds and keep grass short in a perimeter of 30 meters [100 ft] around the house. Seven days before doing this eliminate rodents in the perimeter around the house to avoid migration of the rodents into the interior of the area;- as well as the interior of the residence, dispose of outside garbage in well-closed containers. If there is no possibility of [garbage] collection, it is recommended that it be buried daily in areas far away from the house and covered with a least 50 cm [16 in] of dirt and 30 meters [100 ft] from the house;- keep water storage containers protected. If the water is not potable, always boil it; and- keep storage buildings (grain, straw, tools, etc.) at least 30 meters [100 ft] from the house and well ventilated.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the Los Lagos region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the woman acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in her environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13321>. - Mod.TY]
