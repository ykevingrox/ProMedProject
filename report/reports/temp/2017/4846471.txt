MLive [edited]<http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/cdc_finds_first_genetic_link_b.html>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has discovered the 1st genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with legionnaires' disease in Genesee County -- something researchers have sought throughout the Flint water crisis.But instead of closing the book on what caused the outbreak that killed 12 people in 2014 and 2015, the scientific matches instead raise new questions about whether Flint's water system was the source of the outbreak.Molecular testing by the CDC in late 2016 established the connection between a water sample taken from McLaren-Flint hospital and 3 sputum samples from patients who were diagnosed with legionnaires', officials with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS] told MLive-The Flint Journal.DHHS learned of a genetic match between the water and legionnaires' patients only last month [January 2017], and days later, notified McLaren and the Genesee County Health Department that each may be required to turn over additional water samples and other records to the state.But while the state has focused on McLaren since the genetic links were found, other experts say the three matches, including one victim who was never a patient at McLaren, suggest that _Legionella_ thrived throughout the Flint water system, making it the real culprit in legionnaires' deaths and illnesses in 2014 and 2015.A total of 78 people in the county contracted the disease during those 2 years, during parts of which the city used the Flint River as its source of water without treating it to make it less corrosive to lead pipes and plumbing.""The presence of _Legionella_ in Flint was widespread,"" said Dr Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a national expert on the disease. ""The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system.""On [Tue 14 Feb 2017], the state ratcheted up pressure on the hospital, ordering McLaren to turn over information related to its legionnaires' cases and releasing a letter from a hospital contractor that claimed ""the supply water coming from the city of Flint is not contributing to the _Legionella_ issues at McLaren and any issues are likely internal to the hospital system.""Public health officials identified the Flint River as a potential source of a deadly outbreak of legionnaires' disease some 15 months ago. Stout was hired by McLaren to assist the hospital in defending itself against a USD 100-million lawsuit and against state claims that its failings caused what the state calls the ""largest healthcare-associated legionnaires' outbreak known"" in the United States.Amy Pruden, a Virginia Tech university professor and one of 5 authors of a July 2016 peer-reviewed study on _Legionella_ in Flint water [see reference below] said the 3 genetic matches could represent how widespread the bacterium was in city water. Pruden's study found _Legionella_ levels up to 1000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient who's clinical isolates -- or bacteria -- matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there ""suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere.""The state confirmed the CDC testing showed the lack of a connection between one of the 3 patients and McLaren, but the agency has not previously released details of that case.Public health officials from Genesee County, the state of Michigan, and the federal government all worked on a notice to tell the public about a massive _Legionella_ outbreak in the Flint area in 2015 but shelved their plans before delivering the warning.In contrast, MDHHS used the genetic matches between the hospital and the infected patients who stayed at McLaren as one reason for an order issued [14 Feb 2017] that claims McLaren-Flint's water system ""is a nuisance, unsanitary condition, or cause of illness"" in the community.Angela Minicuci, a spokeswoman for MDHHS, said state medical officials were told of the CDC testing, which matched a clinical sample from a November 2016 legionnaires' patient to a water sample taken in August 2016 at McLaren.Clinical samples from 2 other legionnaires' patients, both diagnosed in 2015, ""were also highly related to the McLaren water sample,"" Minicuci said in an email to MLive-The Flint Journal. The CDC declined to answer questions about its testing, the results of which were turned over to DHHS in January [2016], according to Minicuci.Dr Eden Wells, the state's chief medical executive, said DHHS hasn't been able to determine with certainty how the legionnaires' patient never hospitalized at McLaren was exposed to the same bacteria strain found in hospital water, calling it an open ""medical detective case (that) requires a lot of sleuthing. Do we know what the linkage is?"" Wells asked. ""Not at this time.""Among the possible explanations for the genetic match, according to DHHS, are an association that was never identified during the case investigation, such as a visit to McLaren rather than a hospitalization or exposure to the hospital's cooling towers. ""Cooling towers are always high on our list of concerns when trying to identify a potential _Legionella_ exposure source,"" Minicuci said. ""We don't have any indication or environmental samples to show that this strain is elsewhere in the community, though that's not impossible, but we do have two healthcare-associated cases over a 2-year period that match the McLaren sample, as well as this case strain.""Clinical samples from all 3 patients came from the infected sputum --- their infected phlegm -- that's typically collected by a cough into a cup or obtained by a hospital from the throat or lung, after which it is cultured for routine bacteria with a specialized culture for _Legionella_, according to DHHS.Pruden said even though the water sample matching the patient isolates was collected months after Flint discontinued use of the Flint River, the same strain of the bacteria can persist in plumbing even after Flint was switched back to Lake Huron water.The professor said the genetic matches are ""very relevant to the continuing conversation of demonstrating whether or not switching to the Flint River water triggered the countywide spike in legionnaires' and working toward figuring out exactly where and how the patients were likely exposed and infected with the disease. Despite the difference in time, it shows that a strain that is native to McLaren plumbing matched the strains found in patients,"" Pruden said in an email. ""It shows the that strains of _Legionella_ living in Flint tap water matched with strains found in patients. However ... we don't know if this same strain is found widely in other parts of Flint.""Pruden's report on _Legionella_ and Flint last year [2016] studied both single-story homes and businesses in Flint and Flint Township and at Hurley Medical Center and McLaren, both of which are located in areas of the city where water is more likely to be stagnant.DHHS says McLaren was associated with 21 _Legionella_ cases in 2014, 29 in 2015, and 2 in 2016; the vast majority of hospital-related legionnaires' cases; and 10 of 12 deaths from the disease.Although no _Legionella_ was found in Flint Township, which never used Flint River water, the bacterium was found in Flint tap water at various locations, the study says, supporting the theory that interrupted corrosion control in Flint caused a release of iron, nutrients, and depleted chlorine residual into the entire distribution system, driving the abundance of _Legionella_.Minicuci said the Flint water system should have been assumed to have _Legionella_, ""and high-risk facilities should closely monitor the water coming into their facility and take steps to prevent exposures to their vulnerable patients.""Hospitals and large institutional buildings are known to be particularly susceptible to _Legionella_ colonization, according to Pruden's study.McLaren said in a statement [14 Feb 2017] that the state ""provided absolutely no support in 2014 and 2015"" as evidence piled up that _Legionella_ was a problem in Flint water.Not only was the city being run by a state-appointed emergency manager when the decision was made to change water source, special prosecutors also allege that employees from the state Departments of Environmental Quality and DHHS allowed problems with lead and _Legionella_ to occur and continue by failing to do their jobs in accordance with state law.""Now that criminal charges have been made against several state and city employees and additional indictments are possible, the state is taking an aggressive role in retroactively casting blame for cases it knew about -- and did nothing about -- for years,"" McLaren's statement says.""Despite the fact that dozens of legionnaires' disease cases have been reported in patients that have had absolutely no contact with our facilities, and despite the growing consensus among public health and infectious disease specialists that the city's use of the Flint River as a water source is the prime contributor to our community's legionnaires' disease epidemic, the state refuses to broaden its perspective and hold itself and others accountable for the inaction of prior years,"" the hospital's statement says.Public health officials identified the Flint River as a potential source of the city's legionnaires' outbreak as early as 2014. Gov. Rick Snyder also claimed he was left in the dark about the possible connection, and his emergency managers continued to use the river as a source of water until connections between spikes in lead levels and in the blood of Flint children were uncovered late in 2016.[Byline: Ron Fonger]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Reference---------Schwake DO, Garner E, Strom OR, et al: _Legionella_ DNA markers in tap water coincident with a spike in legionnaires' disease in Flint, MI. Environ Sci Technol. Lett. 2016; 3(9): 311-5; <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.estlett.6b00192>The city of Flint, with a population of 102 434 residents, is the largest city and county seat of Genesee County in the US state of Michigan (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesee_County,_Michigan>). Since June 2014, the city has faced a major public health emergency due to lead poisoning and legionnaires' disease, attributed to use of corrosive water from the Flint River. In April 2014, Flint switched its water supply from Lake Huron (via Detroit) to the Flint River without implementing anti-corrosive measures. Failure to use anti-corrosive treatment on the Flint River water is believed to have led to higher lead and iron levels, and increased iron levels are believed to have in turn led to elevated levels of _Legionella_ in the city's water. Flint switched back to less corrosive Lake Huron water in mid-October 2015.Between June 2014 through October 2015, a total of 91 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease was diagnosed in Flint, when only 12 cases would have been expected to have occurred during this period. 50 of the 91 cases were hospitalized within the 2 weeks before they got sick at the McLaren Flint Hospital, which implicates exposure to a water source in the hospital for their illness, because the incubation period for legionnaires' diseases is 2 to 10 days after exposure. McLaren Flint Hospital was associated with 21 _Legionella_ cases in 2014, 29 cases in 2015, and 10 of the 12 deaths in the 2014-15 period (<http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2017/02/14/state-orders-mclaren-fix-conditions-legionella/97906508/>). However, McLaren gets its water from the city of Flint (<http://www.specialpathogenslab.com/news-and-events/?page=2>), which could have contaminated the hospital's water.Legionnaires' disease has been reported in 17 patients in 2016, suggesting that a water source still exists in Flint after switching back to Lake Huron water in mid-October 2015.Sputum cultures were reportedly not obtained from most patients in Flint (<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/legionnaires-outbreak-in-flint-was-met-with-silence.html>), so that the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease in these patients was likely based on a positive urinary antigen test. This test can only detect infection due to one type of _Legionella_, _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1. However, because genotyping requires an isolate, genotyping could not be done on most patients' pathogen in the absence of a culture.The news report above, says that genotyping done by the CDC in late 2016 established a connection between a water sample taken from McLaren-Flint hospital, the site sampled at McLaren not being specified, and sputum samples from 3 patients with legionnaires' disease. However, we are told that 1 of the 3 patients had not been hospitalized at McLaren, but we are not told if this patient's exposure could have been a visitor to McLaren or exposure to aerosol from McLaren's cooling tower. A non-McLaren source for this patient could also be tap water in his home, but we are not told if water from his home was sampled for culture and if genotyping was done on the isolate.More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable source. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/652>.]
