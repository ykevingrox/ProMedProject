Autochthonous Transmission of East/Central/South African Genotype Chikungunya Virus, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(10): 1737-39. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------We isolated East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype chikungunya virus during the 2016 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Genome sequencing revealed unique mutations in the nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4-A481D) and envelope protein 1 (E1-K211T). Moreover, all Brazil East/Central/South isolates shared the exclusive mutations E1-M407L and E2-A103T.[Results and Discussion]------------------------RJ-IB1 and RJ-IB5 mapped within the ECSA genotype with other isolates from northeastern Brazil (Figure --available at the source URL above]). We found no evidence of intergenotypic recombination despite co-circulation of ECSA and Asian strains in Brazil since 2014. The coding region of the consensus genome sequences revealed mutations in 98.3-100.0 percent of the mapped reads. We detected unique mutations in RJ-IB1 and RJ-IB5 that are absent in other CHIKV isolates: NSP4-A481D in the viral RNA polymerase and E1-K211T in an E1 polymorphic site. A K211E mutation in this same E1 site showed increased CHIKV adaptability to _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in a E1-226A background. Nonetheless, the effects of the E1-K211T substitution in Rio de Janeiro isolates are unknown. Furthermore, we detected unique substitutions in RJ-IB1 (E1-N335D) and RJ-IB5 (NSP2-L27I). Both Rio de Janeiro isolates and the ECSA isolate Bahia-08 share a NSP2-P352A substitution, which is not detected in other Brazil ECSA isolates. In contrast, the Brazil ECSA subgroup shares 2 exclusive mutations (E1-M407L and E2-A103T) that are absent in other ECSA strains. RJ-IB1 and RJ-IB5 genomes do not have the vector-adaptive E1-A226V or E2-L210Q substitutions but do have the E1-T98A substitution also present in other ECSA isolates. We also detected minority variants within the viral population, particularly in RJ-IB1, which showed higher genetic diversity than RJ-IB5). Further investigation of plasma-isolated viruses is necessary to confirm the diversity of minority variants.--Communicated by:Roland HÃŒ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[It will be interesting to learn from future studies if any of these mutations persist in Brazil and have a selective advantage that facilitate transmission by vector mosquitoes or producing higher titer or longer lasting viremias in humans. - Mod.TY]
