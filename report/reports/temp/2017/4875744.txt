Thai Visa News [edited]<http://www.buriramtimes.com/minister-public-health-warns-hand-mouth-foot-disease-children/>The ministry of Public Health has warned teachers and parents about the dangers of hand, mouth and foot (HMFD) in young children.Public Health Minister Piyasakol Sakolsattayathorn said that there were a total of 6790 HMFD patients identified from [Sun 1 Jan - Tue 14 Feb 2017], according to the Department of Disease Control (DDC). Most of the patients were small children aged under 5. He has instructed the provincial public health offices nationwide to ask local child development centers and kindergartens to continuously prevent more infections.The best way to prevent the disease is to keep oneself clean and to wash children's hands often, said the Public Health Minister.The hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by a virus. Patients will experience fever and sores in or on their mouth, hands, and feet.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Six thousand seven hundred and ninety cases is a high number, but although severe disease may occur, most notably with EV71 infection in children, severe disease was not noted here. But see discussion in [2].HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults. It usually starts with a fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and a feeling of being unwell (malaise). One or 2 days after the fever starts, painful sores can develop in the mouth, often in the back of the mouth, as small red spots that blister and can become ulcers. A skin rash with red spots, and sometimes with blisters, may also develop over 1 or 2 days on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; it may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks or genital area. Dehydration may occur because blisters in the mouth create pain with swallowing. Some people, especially adults, may show no symptoms at all, but they can still pass the virus to others.

Compared to the same period in 2016 (3999 cases and 6 deaths), the number of cases is greater by 31 percent.HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7 to 10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.Enterovirus 71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over several years. EV 71 is a non-polio enterovirus.Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[HFMD is caused by such non-polio enteroviruses as coxsackie viruses A16, A4, A5, A9, A10, B2 and B5 and enterovirus 71. Its most common causes are coxsackie virus A16 (CAV 16) and enterovirus 71 (EV 71).Infection with EV71 is usually asymptomatic or associated with a mild non-specific illness. More severe presentations do occur, particularly in children. Presentations include exanthems (including HFMD), herpangina, conjunctivitis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, acute respiratory problem and myopericarditis. It should be noted that infection with EV 71 may result in complications without producing clinically-evident HFMD. This occurred in the context of a large outbreak of EV 71 in Bulgaria.EV 71 is transmitted through direct contact with discharge from the nose and throat, saliva, fluid from blisters or the stools of an infected person. Cases are most infectious during the 1st week of acute illness but may continue to shed virus in stool for weeks. The incubation period is 3-5 days. The epidemiological pattern varies by geographical region and climate, but the incidence of infection is higher in the summer and autumn months in temperate climates while remaining prevalent year-round in tropical climates.
