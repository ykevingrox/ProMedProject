The organization also noted that people living and visiting Greece should take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes throughout the country as they can not predict where the next case might occur.The West Nile virus has been recorded in Greece since 2010, following an outbreak where 262 people contracted the virus from mosquitos, resulting in 35 deaths.[Byline: Kerry Kolasa-Sikiaridi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[West Nile virus (WNV) is an RNA virus within the Flaviviridae family, a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex. Mosquitoes of the genus _Culex_ mainly and to a lesser extent _Aedes_ spp. and _Ochlerotatus_ spp. act as vectors, while several bird species act as amplifying hosts. Horses, humans, and other mammals are also enrolled, acting as incidental or dead-end hosts.Infection from WNV has been an important public health issue for many European countries, including Greece, since 2010. WNV circulation has been recorded in several countries across the European continent, both in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean basin Two main WNV genetic lineages have been reported by various research studies. Lineage 1 has been found in Europe, Africa, Middle East, America, Australia, and India, whereas lineage 2 has been initially recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. (<https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/2450682/>).Several studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between environmental factors and the incidence of WNV. The quantification of the virus circulation in mosquitoes can likely provide evidence for the identification of ""at risk"" areas for human transmission. - Mod.UBAMaps of Greece can be seen at <http://www.sailingissues.com/yachting-guide/greece-maps/greece-map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/61929>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
