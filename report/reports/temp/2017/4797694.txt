Classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a healthcare worker.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the 2 days since the last ProMED-mail update on MERS-CoV in KSA, there have been 2 newly confirmed cases reported. Both from Makkah region (one from Jeddah and one from Turaba). This now brings the total number of MERS-CoV cases reported by Saudi Arabia since [Sun1 Jan 2017] to 22, and represents the 7th consecutive day with a new case being reported each day. Notable is the case reported today [Fri 27 Jan 2017] in a healthcare worker in Jeddah. Hopefully this will be a single case in a healthcare worker with a lapse in infection control procedures and is not the debut of a nosocomial outbreak.Returning to the 22 cases reported since the beginning of the year, the geographic breakdown includes 6 cases from Al Qa £Çm region (all 6 from Buraidah), 5 cases from Riyadh region (4 from Riyadh and one from Al Qararah), 5 cases from Makkah region (3 from Jeddah, 1 from Taif and 1 from Turaba), 4 cases from Ash SharqÇyah (Eastern) region (3 from Hufoof and 1 from Jubail), and 1 each from Al Madinah and Najran regions.Five of the 6 cases from Buraidah (Al Qasim region) were definitively confirmed to be part of a nosocomial outbreak involving 2 healthcare centers (see discussion in WHO update below).Maps of the locations of the newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL.

Two (2) deaths among previously reported MERS cases (cases no. 7 and 8 in DON published on [Tue17 Jan 2017]) were also reported.Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document [see link to MERS-CoV cases reported between [Mon 2 and Sun 7 Jan 2017], an excel spreadsheet available for download at source URL]. The 5 cases from Buridah reported are part of a small health care setting outbreak involving 2 hospitals. A Ministry of Health rapid response team has been dispatched and measures to prevent further cases including contact tracing, and strengthening of infection, prevention and control have been put in place. None of the cases reported are health care workers.(Chart from WHO data)Case no.

So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The WHO report confirms the existence of a small, limited nosocomial outbreak in Buraidah (Al Qasim region) in the beginning of this month [January 2017] involving 5 cases. In the original reports from the Saudi MOH, only 2 of the 5 cases were identified as having had contact in the healthcare environment (case No. 2 above, and another case reported on [Tue 10 Jan 2017] not included in the above outbreak).As I've said before, it is safe to say that MERS-CoV is endemic in Saudi Arabia with cases occurring associated with contact with camels, and the occasional healthcare associated transmission, now hopefully limited and small numbers. What remains to be defined are the high risk exposures that have resulted in ""primary"" cases where there is no clear history of exposure to camels, nor is there a clear history of contact with other known MERS-CoV infected individuals. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>.]
