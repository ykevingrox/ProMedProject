MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2017; doi: <http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6623e1>----------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------What is already known about this topic?Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes serious brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly and has been associated with other severe birth defects. Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.What is added by this report?Overall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.What are the implications for public health practice?Current data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real. Pregnant women should avoid exposure whether by mosquito bite in areas of active virus transmission or from unprotected sexual contact with men who have been in those localities. - Mod.TY]******[3] Zika detection in semenDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017 12:12 CDTSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]<https://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6506-zika-virus-successfully-diagnosed-from-semen>Research presented at ASM Microbe 2017 by experts at the Fertility and Cryogenics Lab shows a reliable clinical assay that can detect the Zika virus from semen samples.""This assay can help reduce Zika infection rates and allow couples who are identified at risk due to travel or geographic location plan their pregnancy,"" said lead author Hisham Greiss MD, PhD, HCLD [High-complexity Clinical Laboratory Director] at the Fertility and Cryogenics Lab. A total of 100 semen samples were spiked with a recombinant Accuplex ZIKV (SeraCare Life Sciences) at 5 viral copies per ml and processed in Aptima Urine Transport medium (Hologic Inc.) and tested using Aptimaå¨ ZIKV assay released under the FDA's emergency use authorization on the fully automated Panther system from Hologic, Inc. The samples were also tested for West Nile virus, Chagas and dengue, recombinant dengue virus, recombinant chikungunya virus, human papilloma virus, herpes simplex virus 1, herpes simplex virus 2, _Chlamydia_, and gonorrhea. The experiment was repeated 3 times and in triplicates each time.The assay was found to be 100 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific to ZIKV RNA from semen samples with a limit of detection of 5 viral copies per mL of semen.Zika fever symptoms are often misdiagnosed due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms, so an accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance for management of the disease and to prevent neonatal infections. Zika infection during pregnancy can also cause serious birth defects and is associated with other pregnancy problems.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[A fast, sensitive and specific test for the presence of Zika virus in semen will be useful for testing semen of men who have been in areas of Zika virus transmission and for sperm banks.The abstract for this 4 Jun 2017 presentation at the ASM meeting is available at <http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4358/presentation/2808>.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]******[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmissionDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017Source: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654>ref: GÌ¦ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Background. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competenceMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.Conclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.Author summary--------------Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]******[6] NS1 vaccineDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017Source: American Society for Microbiology [edited]<https://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika>Research presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].In the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. ""A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,"" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.Because the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.An NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes. Therefore, said Guirakhoo, ""a vaccine that can induce effective antibodies to NS1 and disable its function has the potential to reduce growth and transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. This could enhance vaccine effectiveness in endemic areas by blocking the virus transmission from infected individuals to other members of the community.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This approach to NS-1 antigen selection for a vaccine, to avoid the risk of ADE, is interesting. Presumably, the next steps will be to test the vaccine in non-human primates and in vector mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]
