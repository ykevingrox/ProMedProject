Geosentinel Bordeaux Site, Tropical Medicine and Travel Clinics, Bordeaux University Hospital, France. [edited]A 64-year-old French [female] with type 2 diabetes mellitus was referred to our department on [Mon 3 Jul 2017] because she was suffering from protracted diarrhea.Symptoms began on [Sat 10 Jun 2017] as she was just returning from a touristic trip in Cancun (Quintana Roo State, Mexico) where she stayed from [Mon 29 May to Fri 9 Jun 2017] with her husband.She acknowledged having moderate watery diarrhea with abdominal discomfort, bloating, transient vomiting, 5 kg weight [approx. 11.02 pounds] loss and fatigue. Empiric therapy with oral Metronidazole 500 mg 3 times a day for 7 days she received previously failed to improve her symptoms. Of note, a 1st microscopic stool examination failed to identify parasites and no enteropathogenic bacteria was found by culture on selective media.Up to 3 extra stool specimens where sent to the laboratory of clinical parasitology in our hospital.Oocysts of Cyclospora cayetanensis where evidenced by autofluorescence after Bailenger concentration technique.Treatment with Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim 800/160 mg given orally twice a day for 7 days allowed dramatic clinical improvement.Her husband reported bloating since he returned from Mexico and was subsequently found to be infected with Cyclospora cayetanensis too. He received the same therapeutic schedule.This is not the 1st report of Cyclosporiasis in tourists returning from Mexico. But it happens while a huge number of people where affected after a graduation party in the city of Leon (Guanajuato State, Mexico) a few weeks ago.--Dr Alexandre DuvignaudGeosentinel Bordeaux Site co-directorTropical Medicine and Travel ClinicsBordeaux University HospitalFrance<alexandre.duvignaud@chu-bordeaux.fr>Prof Denis MalvyGeosentinel Bordeaux Site directorHead of Tropical Medicine and Travel ClinicsBordeaux University HospitalFrance[_Cyclospora cayetensis_ from Mexico is frequently reported as behind the food-borne outbreaks in the United States and Canada, and has also been reported in travellers from Mexico (see the ProMED reports below). Thus it is not surprising that 2 French travellers return from Mexico with _Cyclospora_ infection. - Mod.EP][The HealthMap/ProMED map of Estado de Quintana Roo, Mexico can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/506>. - Mod.MPP][See Also:Cyclosporiasis - Mexico: (GJ) RFI: 20170708.51599372016----Cyclosporiasis - UK (02): ex Mexico (Riviera Maya) alert: 20160805.4396881Cyclosporiasis - UK: ex Mexico 20160730.43816652015----Cyclosporiasis - UK, Canada: ex Mexico, RFI 20151101.3759380Cyclosporiasis - USA (05): ex Mexico 20150827.3606898Cyclosporiasis - USA (04): ex Mexico 20150813.3576519].................................................mpp/ep/ec/mpp"
