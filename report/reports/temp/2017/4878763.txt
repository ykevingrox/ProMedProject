The HK illnesses are similar to those reported in the link below;<http://www.jnursinghomeresearch.com/442-legionnaires-disease-in-nursing-homes-and-long-term-care-facilities-an-emerging-catastrophe.html>And the HK facilities are listed as sheltered workshops, which may have similar living and working conditions. <http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201206/20/P201206200290.htm>Affiliation: ENSYMA Engineering--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMed thanks the contributor for his input. The submitter has suggested Legionnaires' disease as a possible cause, which is a pneumonic illness, and not an upper respiratory tract infection (URI). However, in the same scenario, Pontiac fever could possibly present as a URI. Pontiac fever is a flu-like illness caused by the bacterium _Legionella pneumophila_ contracted by breathing mist that comes from a water source (such as air conditioning cooling towers, whirlpool spas, showers) contaminated with the bacteria. The incubation period is short, from a few hours to 2 days, before the onset of fever and muscle aches. Persons with Pontiac fever do not have pneumonia. They generally recover in 2 to 5 days without treatment. Pontiac fever is so-named because of an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan. It is a milder form of legionellosis than Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by the same bacterium.As no further data on laboratory results of the cases has become available thus far, a number of differential diagnoses could be hypothesized based on the setting and epidemiological course. - Mod.UBALegionellosis is bacterial respiratory disease caused by _Legionella_ species. Clinically legionellosis can present as either Legionnaires' disease (LD) or Pontiac fever (PF). LD presents as a flu-like illness (fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, and malaise) with cough, and physical signs and radiologic evidence of pneumonia, whereas PF presents, as a flu-like illness without pneumonia. The attack rate for LD is less than 5 percent, whereas that of PF is over 90 percent and the incubation period of LD is 2-10 days after exposure versus 1-3 days after exposure for PF. LD is more severe - hospitalization is commonly required and the case-fatality rate is about 30 percent for hospitalized patients, whereas PF rarely requires hospitalization and has no fatalities (<https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html>). Outbreaks that involve cases of both LD and PF have been described.The diagnosis of PF is usually made on the basis of an outbreak associated with common, aerosolized, environmental source containing _Legionella_, a high attack rate, short incubation period, a short-duration, nonfatal, nonpneumonic illness characterized by malaise, myalgia, and fever, and development of antibodies to the isolated _Legionella_ species in a significant fraction of affected people. Legionella urinary antigen assay only detects legionellosis due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, but is variably positive in PF outbreaks associated with _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/44/2/229/330131/Urine-Antigen-Tests-Positive-for-Pontiac-Fever>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.][See Also:Undiagnosed respiratory disease: China (Hong Kong) RFI 20170303.4868980].................................................ml/uba/ml/ec/ml"
