Cape Cod Times [edited]<http://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20170929/vibrio-cases-close-katama-bay-to-oystering>Katama Bay [Massachusetts] will be closed to oyster harvesting for 14 days because of 3 confirmed cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ linked to the consumption of raw oysters collected from the area earlier in September 2017, according to the state Department of Public Health. 2 of the 3 cases were linked to people eating oysters harvested on a single day, a statement from the department says. The closure started Friday morning, 29 Sep 2017, and the bay is expected to reopen to oystering at sunrise 13 Oct 2017._Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills, usually within 24 hours of ingestion, and the symptoms typically last 3 days, according to the department. In rare cases, it also can cause severe illness or even death in people with compromised immune systems.The precautionary closure is mandated under the US Food and Drug Administration and National Shellfish Sanitation Program's Model Ordinance.[Byline: Ethan Genter]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 28 Sep 2017 8:00 PM EDTSource: Cape Cod Times [edited]<http://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20170928/study-warmer-ocean-raises-threat-of-vibrio-bacteria>The waters off Cape Cod [Massachusetts] and north to Canada are warming faster than 99 percent of the world's ocean, according to a 2016 study by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries scientist Vincent Saba.One of the consequences: the marine bacteria _Vibrio_, responsible for 80 000 cases of foodborne illness, wound infections, and 300 deaths annually in the USA, could expand geographically and its growing season could lengthen as ocean temperatures in the Northeast increase by 5.4 to 7 degrees by 2100, according to a newly released study co-authored by Saba. ""I suspect that there is a higher probability of the _Vibrio_ species occurring,"" Saba said, although salinity can inhibit bacterial population growth.The study, published in the recent American Geophysical Union journal GeoHealth, was co-authored by Saba, Barbara Muhling at the Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate in California, and three other contributors. Although the study concentrated on the Chesapeake Bay, Saba believed it would apply to northern waters as well.The majority of illnesses are caused by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, which is rarely fatal but causes diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Eating raw oysters is the most common way to contract it. Until recently, there were very few, if any, cases in the Northeast as the region's cold water was thought to inhibit the kind of explosive growth that could result in illness. Scientists initially believed _V. parahaemolyticus_ needed water temperatures greater than [80 deg F/26.7 deg C] to multiply rapidly.Those temperatures are rarely seen for any sustained period in Massachusetts, but a strain of _V. parahaemolyticus_, thought to have originated in the Pacific Northwest moved into Massachusetts waters over the past decade and enjoys water temperatures 10 deg cooler. It now accounts for 80 percent of cases, said Christopher Schillaci, _V. parahaemolyticus_ program director for the state Division of Marine Fisheries.Additionally, the region's cold water defense is being undercut by the weakening of a major Atlantic Ocean current that brings warmer water north and returns colder water to the south. Water temperature data appears to show the Gulf Stream bulging in toward the land, carrying warmer, saltier water with it.Researchers hope to apply the fine scale model employed in the Chesapeake that showed substantial increases in population and growing season, to northern waters. But state shellfish officials said a _Vibrio_ management plan put into effect 5 years ago is flexible enough to address environmental changes like temperature increases. ""We have a plan to account for these extreme temperatures,"" Schillaci said.After the state saw a handful of confirmed illnesses in 2011, the Division of Marine Fisheries and state Department of Public Health developed a plan with a goal of chilling oysters quickly to halt bacterial growth. It initially required that oysters be chilled with ice within a couple of hours of harvest and reach an internal temperature of 50 deg C (122 deg F) within 10 hours. That 2 hour time period was reduced to one hour when the number of cases continued to rise in succeeding years. There was a 50 percent reduction in the number of cases from 2015 to 2016 and this year's [2017] caseload appears to be similar, he said, cautioning that a year's worth of data does not constitute a trend.Schillaci also pointed out that the models in Saba's study are not accurate enough to predict anything more than an overall increase in _Vibrio_ populations for the Northeast. There are 43 species of _Vibrio_ bacteria, and only 3 are of concern. Only 1 percent of the strains within those species are responsible for human illnesses and each prefers specific environmental conditions to thrive, Schillaci said. Models are not specific enough to say which strain benefits from which temperature and salinity changes within each growing area and whether those will be ones causing illness, he said.Consumers should understand that the state and growers have taken steps to protect their health, he said. ""These studies are great to keep our eyes open, to think ahead, and address these problems,"" said Wellfleet Shellfish Constable Nancy Civetta. ""One thing I know about working with fishermen is that they are adaptable. Right now they are doing an amazing job at icing and lower temperatures quickly. They will do whatever they need to do to bring healthy oysters to market because it's their livelihood.""[Byline: Doug Fraser]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) report published in GeoHealth: Muhling, BA, Jacobs J, Stock CA, Gaitan CF, Saba VS: Projections of the future occurrence, distribution, and seasonality of three _Vibrio_ species in the Chesapeake Bay under a high-emission climate change scenario, GeoHealth, 1, doi:10.1002/2017GH000089 can be accessed at <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GH000089/full>.Eating locally acquired raw shellfish only during months containing an ""r"" in its name may decrease infection transmission during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the Northern Hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming is truly occurring, this pathogen and others are occurring in areas previously not seeing it and with shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore.The state of Massachusetts can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63222>.
