Zika Virus Disease in the Americas: A Storm in the Making.AbstractMore than 700 000 cases of Zika virus (ZIKAV) disease have been officially reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) from 48 countries and territories of the Americas. The response led by the PAHO and partners suggests major lessons of this outbreak. A seemingly innocuous pathogen became the new villain, causing fear, economic losses and, most importantly, debilitating birth defects and neurological problems, reaffirming the well-known war principle of never to underestimate one's opponent. The ZIKAV tested public health capacities under the International Health Regulations, highlighting the need for continued investment in health security. Last but not least, the lack of appropriate tools was another reminder of the pressing need for innovative solutions to persistent problems. Latin America and the Caribbean have approximately 500 million persons living in areas at risk for transmission of ZIKAV. The fight against ZIKAV is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the Americas, the expansion of dengue fever over the past 4 decades, then the recent documented appearance of chikungunya virus and now Zika virus have rung the alarm bells for several decades up to the present time. For whom and for what will the alarm bells ring next time? One hopes that in the aftermath of the Zika virus outbreak, an effective system of surveillance, timely epidemiological field work, all supported by laboratories, will remain in place. Institution memory and political commitment tends to fade in the absence of a crisis. Perhaps this time things will be different and sustainable. - Mod.TY]******[3] Sexual transmission, monkeysDate: August 2017 [ahead of print]Source: Emerg Infect Dis. 23 (8) https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2308170036 DOI: 10.3201/eid2308.170036 [edited]<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/8/17-0036_article#suggestedcitation>Haddow AD, Nalca A, Rossi FD, Miller LJ, Wiley MR, Perez-Sautu U, et al. High infection rates for adult macaques after intravaginal or intrarectal inoculation with Zika virus.AbstractUnprotected sexual intercourse between persons residing in or traveling from regions with Zika virus transmission is a risk factor for infection. To model risk for infection after sexual intercourse, we inoculated rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with Zika virus by intravaginal or intrarectal routes. In macaques inoculated intravaginally, we detected viremia and virus RNA in 50 percent of macaques, followed by seroconversion. In macaques inoculated intrarectally, we detected viremia, virus RNA, or both, in 100 percent of both species, followed by seroconversion. The magnitude and duration of infectious virus in blood of macaques suggest humans infected with Zika virus through sexual transmission will likely generate viremias sufficient to infect competent mosquito vectors. Our results indicate that transmission of Zika virus by sexual intercourse might serve as a virus maintenance mechanism in the absence of mosquito-to-human transmission and could increase the probability of establishment and spread of Zika virus in regions where this virus is not present.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As the authors point out, in an environment where active mosquito transmission of Zika virus is occurring, it is difficult to determine what proportion of cases is due to sexual transmission and what proportion to mosquito transmission. It seems certain that the incidence of sexual Zika virus transmission is underestimated. - Mod.TY]******[4] No dengue antibody ADE with Zika virusDate: Fri 23 Jun 2017 [ahead of print]Source: Nature Communications doi:10.1038/ncomms15674 [edited]<https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15674#auth-1>Petraleigh Pantoja, Erick X. PÌ©rez-GuzmÌÁn, Idia V. RodrÌ guez, Laura J. White et al. Zika virus pathogenesis in rhesus macaques is unaffected by pre-existing immunity to dengue virus.Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging virus that has recently spread into dengue virus (DENV) endemic regions and cross-reactive antibodies (Abs) could potentially affect ZIKV pathogenesis. Using DENV-immune serum, it has been shown in vitro that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection can occur. Here we study the effects of pre-existing DENV immunity on ZIKV infection in vivo. We infect 2 cohorts of rhesus macaques with ZIKV; one cohort has been exposed to DENV 2.8 years earlier and a 2nd control cohort is naÌøve to flaviviral infection. Our results, while confirming ADE in vitro, suggest that pre-existing DENV immunity does not result in more severe ZIKV disease. Rather our results show a reduction in the number of days of ZIKV viremia compared to naÌøve macaques and that the previous exposure to DENV may result in modulation of the immune response without resulting in enhancement of ZIKV pathogenesis.DiscussionIt would be interesting to know whether ADE predisposes utero infection and congenital malformations. Although that is not the focus of this study, our results provide valuable clues that the pre-existence of a long-term immune response to DENV neither enhances the peak of ZIKV viremia nor impairs the course of its infection. In addition, we show that the pre-existing immunity to DENV tends to modulate the innate, humoral and T-cell immune responses. Because fetal abnormalities have been associated with prolonged ZIKV viremia, and more recently, higher viremia has been linked to invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) in macaques, results from our work may suggest that pregnant women with previous exposure to DENV may have limited ZIKV viremia and less tendency to have invasion of CNS. These inferences invigorate the need for further direct and in-depth investigations. Our results reinforce the value of NHP model to understand the complex serological interaction among flaviviruses and to support the design of effective flavivirus vaccines.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It would be interesting to have follow up studies with pregnant monkeys to confirm the author's suggestions that viremia would be suppressed and risk of infection of the placenta and fetus reduced. - Mod.TY]******[5] Zika virus tropismDate: Fri 23 Jun 2017Source: Acta Neuropathologica CommunicationsNeuroscience of Disease20175:50 DOI: 10.1186/s40478-017-0450-8 [edited]<https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-017-0450-8>Stephanie L. Cumberworth,  Jennifer A. Barrie,, Madeleine E. Cunningham, Daniely Paulino Gomes de Figueiredo, et al. Zika virus tropism and interactions in myelinating neural cell cultures: CNS cells and myelin are preferentially affected.AbstractThe recent global outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been linked to severe neurological disorders affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS and CNS, respectively). The pathobiology underlying these diverse clinical phenotypes are the subject of intense research; however, even the principal neural cell types vulnerable to productive Zika infection remain poorly characterized. Here we used CNS and PNS myelinating cultures from wild type and Ifnar1 knockout mice to examine neuronal and glial tropism and short-term consequences of direct infection with a Brazilian variant of ZIKV. Cell cultures were infected pre-or post-myelination for various intervals, then stained with cell-type and ZIKV-specific antibodies. In bypassing systemic immunity using ex vivo culture, and the type I interferon response in Ifnar1 deficient cells, we were able to evaluate the intrinsic infectivity of neural cells. Through systematic quantification of ZIKV infected cells in myelinating cultures, we found that ZIKV infection is enhanced in the absence of the type I interferon responses and that CNS cells are considerably more susceptible to infection than PNS cells. In particular, we demonstrate that CNS axons and myelinating oligodendrocytes are especially vulnerable to injury. These results have implications for understanding the pathobiology of neurological symptoms associated with ZIKV infection. Furthermore, we provide a quantifiable ex vivo infection model that can be used for fundamental and therapeutic studies on viral neuroinvasion and its consequences.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Advances in the pathophysiology of Zika virus infection at the celular level are providing model systems that can lead to effective therapeutics.

Accuracy of Zika virus disease case definition during simultaneous Dengue and Chikungunya epidemics.AbstractBackgroundZika is a new disease in the American continent and its surveillance is of utmost importance, especially because of its ability to cause neurological manifestations as Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome and serious congenital malformations through vertical transmission. The detection of suspected cases by the surveillance system depends on the case definition adopted. As the laboratory diagnosis of Zika infection still relies on the use of expensive and complex molecular techniques with low sensitivity due to a narrow window of detection, most suspected cases are not confirmed by laboratory tests, mainly reserved for pregnant women and newborns. In this context, an accurate definition of a suspected Zika case is crucial in order for the surveillance system to gauge the magnitude of an epidemic.MethodologyWe evaluated the accuracy of various Zika case definitions in a scenario where dengue and chikungunya viruses co-circulate. Signs and symptoms that best discriminated PCR confirmed Zika from other laboratory confirmed febrile or exanthematic diseases were identified to propose and test predictive models for Zika infection based on these clinical features.Results and discussionOur derived score prediction model had the best performance because it demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity, 86.6 percent and 78.3 percent, respectively. This Zika case definition also had the highest values for auROC (0Û¢903) and R ^2 (0Û¢417), and the lowest Brier score 0Û¢096.ConclusionsIn areas where multiple arboviruses circulate, the presence of rash with pruritus or conjunctival hyperemia, without any other general clinical manifestations such as fever, petechia or anorexia is the best Zika case definition.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This study was based on 659 participating subjects, of whom 138 were PCR positive for Zika virus, 113 for dengue viruses and 45 for chikungunya virus.  The remaining cases were classified as other febrile illnesses. It will be interesting to see if the Zika virus infection case definition holds up over time with a larger series of cases due to infection by the 3 viruses. - Mod.TY][A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52913>.]
