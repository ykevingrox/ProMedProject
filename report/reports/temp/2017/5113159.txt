WHO Surveillance and monitoring, influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update - 291 (based on data up to 28 May 2017)--------------------------------------------------------Summary-------In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity started to increase slowly but remained low in general. Influenza activity in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere continued to decrease. Worldwide, influenza B viruses were predominant.- In temperate South America, influenza like illness (ILI) levels increased over the prior weeks and crossed the seasonal threshold in Chile and Paraguay. Influenza activity also increased in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominant.- In Southern Africa influenza activity remained low and below the seasonal threshold.- In Oceania, influenza activity remained low in Australia and New Zealand with influenza A and B viruses co-circulating.- In tropical South America, influenza activity remained low in most of the region, with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses predominating.- In the Caribbean and Central America countries, respiratory virus activity remained low.- In East Asia, influenza activity was low in general, except in China where detections of all seasonal influenza subtypes continued to be reported.- In Southern Asia, low levels of influenza activity continued to be reported.- In Western Asia, influenza activity was low in general.- In South East Asia, influenza activity increased slightly in recent weeks, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region.- In Western Africa, few influenza detections were reported in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. In Eastern Africa, increased influenza activity was reported in Madagascar and the Republic of Mauritius, with influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominant, respectively.- In Northern Africa, no influenza detections were reported.- In Europe, influenza activity was low in general. In Northern and Eastern Europe, low levels of influenza B virus detections were reported. No influenza virus detections were reported in South West Europe.- In Central Asia, available reports on respiratory illness indicators indicated low activity.- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease overall.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 75 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 15 May 2017 to 28 May 2017 (data as of 9 Jun 2017 3:31:42 PM UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 69 469 specimens during that time period; 5598 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2798 (50 percent) were typed as influenza A and 2800 (50 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 897 (40.1 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1339 (59.9 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 216 (38.7 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 342 (61.3 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In most parts of Northern hemisphere, influenza activity is low or at inter-seasonal levels. In the southern hemisphere, a slight increase in influenza activity has been reported with elevated ILI activity in temperate South America and East Africa. However, individual reports of increased activity have been received from Asia, including Taiwan (influenza A/H3N2 and parainfluenza infections, -- see PRO/SOAS Influenza (40): Taiwan, situation update 20170615.5102472), and some reports from India (influenza A/H1N1 Pdm09- PRO/SOAS Influenza (39): India (Rajasthan) H1N1, fatal 20170603.5076902). No novel influenza viruses were reported. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8854>.]
