The 1st cholera outbreak reported in 2017 was in Tana River County. The outbreak started on 10 Oct 2016 and was controlled by April 2017.A 2nd wave of cholera outbreaks started in Garissa County on 2 Apr 2017 and was reported later in 9 other counties including Nairobi, Murang'a, Vihiga, Mombasa, Turkana, Kericho, Nakuru, Kiambu, and Narok. The outbreak is being reported in the general population and in refugee camps. In Garissa County, the outbreak is affecting mainly Dadaab refugee camps and cases and deaths are being reported from Hagadera, Dagahaleh, and IFO2 camps. In Turkana county, the disease is also affecting Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps.In addition to the outbreak reported in the general population, there have been 2 point source cholera outbreaks in Nairobi County. One occurred among participants attending a conference in a Nairobi hotel on 22 Jun 2017. A total of 146 patients associated with this outbreak have been treated in different hospitals in Nairobi. A 2nd outbreak occurred at the China Trade Fair held at the KICC Tsavo Ball between 10 and 12 Jul 2017. A total of 136 cases were reported and one death.Currently, the outbreak is active in 2 counties, namely Garissa and Nairobi. As of 17 Jul 2017, a total of 1216 suspected cases including 14 deaths (case fatality rate: 1.2 percent) have been reported since 1 Jan 2017. In the week ending 16 Jul 2017, a total of 38 cases with no deaths were reported.A total of 124 cases tested positive for _Vibrio cholera_ in the reference laboratory. In the week ending 25 Jun 2017, 18 samples out of 25 tested positive for _Vibrio cholera_ Ogawa by culture at the National Public Health Laboratory in Nairobi.The main causative factors of the current outbreak include the high population density that is conducive to the propagation and spread of the disease, mass gatherings (a wedding party held in Karen and in a hotel during an international conference), low access to safe water and proper sanitation and the massive population movements in country and with neighboring countries.Since December 2014, the Republic of Kenya has been experiencing continuous large outbreaks of cholera, with a cumulative total of 17 597 cases reported (10 568 cases reported in 2015 and 6448 in 2016).Public health response----------------------The country has activated the national task force to coordinate the response to the outbreak. Since January 2017, WHO and partners are providing technical support to the country for the control of the outbreak. The country will develop a response plan with focus on the preparedness interventions to avert further spread of the outbreak. The WHO country office will repurpose their staff members and experts deployed in Nairobi for the management of the post El NiÌ±o effects in the Horn of Africa to support the quick control of this outbreak. WHO will also support the five most at risk counties with disease surveillance and response coordination. Partners on the ground are committed to provide support to the ongoing response efforts including support to primary health care and social mobilization by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).WHO risk assessment-------------------Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of bacterium _Vibrio cholera_ present in faecally contaminated water or food. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is always considered a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the exposure frequency, population exposed and the context.Cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Republic of Kenya every year with large cyclical epidemics every 5 to 7 years.The risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at national and regional levels and moderate at global level. The outbreak occurred in the context of a sub-regional drought, conflicts and insecurity in the Horn of Africa. In addition, the outbreak is affecting the densely populated capital city Nairobi, and 2 large refugee camps (Kakuma and Dadaab) with massive population movements within country and between neighbouring countries. Previous large outbreaks in the Republic of Kenya have originated from similar settings, and the risk for propagation of cholera within the affected area as well as to other parts of the country is high. The country has identified a limited capacity for response and low access to safe water. There is an opportunity to implement early preparedness and response measures to contain the outbreak and prevent spread.The current outbreaks linked to mass gathering activities poses additional risk of food safety as well as the need to conduct sanitary inspection in restaurants and hotels.WHO recommendations-------------------WHO recommends improving the readiness of counties and health facilities to early detect and respond to the cholera outbreak as well as the reinforcement of coordination and multisectoral approaches. In addition, hygiene practices in households, restaurant, hotels, refugee camps and health facilities should be improved and food safety interventions should be strengthened.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Republic of Kenya based on the information available on the current outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp******[2] Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi)Date: Fri 21 Jul 2017 00:00 GMT+3Source: Standard Digital [edited]<https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001248466/12-new-cases-reported-as-cholera-spreads-in-nairobi>Another 12 cases of cholera have been reported in Nairobi as the outbreak continues to give national and county government health officials sleepless nights. 6 of the latest victims have been admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and the others at a newly opened centre at Mukuru Kwa Reuben slums. The 6 are in addition to the 67 people who had been admitted to KNH earlier, according to the Ministry of Health. And it emerged yesterday [20 Jul 2017] that Jacaranda Hotel in Nairobi was ordered closed after its staff tested positive for cholera.Nairobi health executive Bernard Muiya said a number of employees had cholera and it was not as a result of outside catering. ""Several workers at the hotel tested positive for cholera and that is why we ordered it closed down,"" he said. Close to 400 cases of cholera have so far been reported in Nairobi. Governor Evans Kidero also ordered the closure of an educational centre in Mukuru kwa Rueben slums which was said to have been hard-hit by the outbreak. This was after sewage filled the school compound after pipes burst.The situation has been worsened by unlicensed food vendors and an acute shortage of water that has hit many parts of the capital. While the food safety department is a devolved function, under the office of public health in counties, the national government has had to step in after its senior officials were affected. ""The reason the Ministry of Health has joined the war against cholera is because the disease has hit us. It has yet to make sense to us because we do not expect high-end hotels to be hit by the disease,"" said a top official from Afya House.Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu has blamed the outbreak of cholera on food handlers and water shortage. ""Food handlers must be re-examined within the next 21 days and this is not negotiable,"" Dr Mailu said. The county government, which is expected to handle food inspection and licensing of vendors, says it does not have the capacity. The county has to take samples to other laboratories for testing as it facility at City Hall Annex lacks that capacity. ""We have had to outsource laboratory services to test samples because there is a major backlog at our facility,"" said an officer at City Hall who did not wish to be named. Afya House is also helping the county government to test some of the samples as officials rush to beat the epidemic. ""The Ministry of Health, together with the Public Health Laboratory, are supporting the county in microbiological testing of food,"" said the Deputy Director of Public Health at the ministry, James Mwitari.Mailu noted that shortage of water was playing a major role in the spread of the disease, adding that a task force would be established to look into ways of stabilizing supply. ""When people start getting water from bowsers, carts, and other containers, then there is the risk of contamination. The disease spreads through water meaning, once a central water source is contaminated, everyone who relies on it is likely to get the disease,"" said Mailu.The Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has claimed that it loses up to 200 000 cubic meters of water to cartels and burst pipes, leading to the massive shortage of the commodity in the city. In the case of Jacaranda Hotel, the sales manager, Liz Tapawa, claimed that the hotel's kitchens and food handling areas had been inspected on and declared safe. She said public health officials said they were satisfied with the hotel's sanitation and that there was no cause for alarm.[Byline: Nasibo Kabale, Mercy Odhiambo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi): trade forumDate Fri 14 Jul 2017 3:00 PM EATSource: The Star [edited]<http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/07/14/css-rotich-adan-mohamed-admitted-after-reports-of-cholera-outbreak_c1597290>Cabinet Secretaries [CSs] of the Treasury and Industrialization are among at least 70 patients admitted at Nairobi hospitals with what may be cholera. The 2 are at Nairobi Hospital where doctors are observing them. A highly-placed source at the hospital said that the Treasury secretary was rushed there at midday on [Fri 14 Jul 2017], after reporting he had diarrhea. He and his personal assistant did not answer calls for comment on the report.A cholera outbreak was reported at the KICC [Kenyatta International Convention Centre] in Nairobi, reports indicating majority of those attending a trade forum, including the CSs, got infected. Also admitted at Nairobi Hospital is an NTV journalist who was covering the expo that kicked off on [Wed 12 Jul 2017].Kenyatta National Hospital spokesman Simon Ithai told The Star several people are admitted there with the disease but could not confirm where the cases were initially reported. ""We are working on a detailed report to know the origin of the cases,"" he said.A similar case was reported at Weston Hotel in Nairobi in June 2017. Sick doctors posted on social media laboratory results showing they tested positive for cholera. They possibly contracted the disease at the hotel where they had been attending a week-long health conference.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Kenya can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/kck73tk> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3991>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[4] Cholera - South SudanDate: Thu 20 Jul 2017Source: Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/20/c_136459555.htm>The WHO said [Thu 20 Jul 2017], it is working with South Sudan's health ministry and partners to scale up use of oral cholera vaccines and strengthen strategies for improving access to patient care, surveillance, and social mobilization to combat outbreaks.WHO said in a statement on [Thu 20 Jul 2017], that it has received 500 000 doses of oral cholera vaccine (OVC) for a planned campaign scheduled to take place from 28 Jul to 3 Aug 2017 in 4 selected counties with high active transmission. The UN health agency said a total of 17 785 cholera cases including 320 deaths have been reported from 24 counties in South Sudan since the outbreak was reported in June 2016. The agency added that it is helping South Sudan implement the integrated approach for cholera control, which seeks to harness strategies for improving access to patient care, surveillance, social mobilization, water and sanitation among others.Joseph Wamala, WHO epidemiologist, said cholera is endemic in South Sudan and historically, outbreaks have occurred along major commercial routes and rivers in the dry season as well as during the rainy season, adding that a successful vaccination campaign would scale down further outbreaks. ""South Sudan has suffered from several major cholera outbreaks in the last 4 years. Following other successful oral cholera vaccine campaigns, WHO and partners can make a real difference in controlling the outbreak in Tonj and Kapoeta states and in other parts of the country,"" said Wamala.The UN health agency said with some 6 million people in South Sudan facing starvation, there is possibility of the cholera outbreak spreading further across the East African nation, adding that it has scaled up collaboration with partners to abate the situation. It added that drought has also led to the drying of water points in some regions leading to the population using contaminated water from the remaining few unprotected points leading to repeated outbreaks of water-borne diseases including cholera. It said WHO and partners have been responding across the country, particularly in places facing famine, food insecurity and disease outbreaks. According to WHO, many countries and partners have introduced OCVs [oral cholera vaccines] as part of their cholera control programs in endemic and epidemic settings.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of South Sudan can be seen at <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/28_States_of_South_Sudan.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[5] Cholera - SudanDate: Wed 19 Jul 2017Source: AllAfrica, Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201707200158.html>On [Mon 17 Jul 2017], in Khartoum the Health Minister Bahar Idris Abugarda announced the spread of 'watery diarrhea' in 12 states and confirmed the death of 4 people and infection of 186 others during the past week. Reports of deaths and infections continue to reach this station from across Sudan.South Darfur------------In the last 10 days, 10 people have died and 26 others have been infected with cholera at camp El Salam in Nyala, capital of South Darfur. One of the Sheikhs of the camp told Radio Dabanga that the epidemic appeared at Madarin village and moved to Yebeldiyat village near the camp on [8 Jul 2017]. He pointed to the emergence of cases at camp El Salam on [12 Jul 2017], and said that on [Tue 18 Jul 2017], the camp isolation centre received 2 cases, bringing the total number of cases during the past 10 days to 26 cases. 10 people died.Red Sea state-------------Tokar hospital in the Red Sea state has recorded 13 new cases of cholera during the past 3 days. Journalist Osman Hashim told Radio Dabanga that the cases of cholera were concentrated in the Kurit district of Tokar. He pointed to the poor health care at Tokar Hospital and other state hospitals.West Kordofan schools closed----------------------------Schools in 3 localities in West Kordofan state have remained closed because parents have refused to allow their children to go to school for fear of cholera. A parent told Radio Dabanga that the schools in Abu Zabad, Sunut, and El Dabker have still been closed despite the announcement by the Ministry of Education that the study had started in all localities of the state since 2 Jul 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from Google Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[6] Cholera - SudanDate: Tue 18 Jul 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb , Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-situation-el-dindir-worsens-six-dead-south-darfur>Sennar state------------The area of El Dindir in Sennar state recorded 31 deaths by cholera this week. In a collaborative report doctors found that the local health centres are too ill-equipped to effectively treat all infected people. The population in El Dindir, amounting to more than 193 000 people in 88 villages in the southeastern state, are under threat from contracting the infectious disease, according to a new report by the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors.There have been 45 people who died from cholera and 280 cases of infection in the hospitals and health centres in the locality. ""These numbers will rise in the poor conditions of the health centres,"" the report, published on [Mon 17 Jul 2017], reads. ""The buildings are ill-equipped and lacking cadres and aides.""An increase in the number of cases in the past days coincided with a poor drinking water supply, the doctors said, in particular with regard to the rainy season in the summer months. The area is known for high rainfall during these months. The most recent deadly cholera victims were reported in El Tamrab village on [Mon 17 Jul 2017], from a total of 31 people who died from cholera.An activist in El Dindir reported to Radio Dabanga that the hospitalized cases at one of the medical isolation centres have amounted to 13 people. He called for the provision of awareness about hygienic environments, in light of the government's inaction. The Sudanese authorities and humanitarian relief organizations in the country refuse to make any reference to the disease being cholera.Darfur camps------------In Darfur's Zamzam camp for displaced people 3 new cases of cholera were recorded. Reports from El Salam camp south of Nyala in South Darfur also reported cases of cholera and deaths: 6 people died last week [week of 10 Jul 2017]. There were 17 cases of infection in total, volunteers said. The volunteer warned of increased rates of infection in El Salam camp and the surrounding villages when the rainy season peaks in South Darfur. Starting mid-June 2017, torrential rains swept through camps, leaving the streets flooded and numbers of families homeless.Cholera is a fast-developing, highly contagious infection that can spread in areas short of clean drinking water and with poor sanitation. In September 2016 Radio Dabanga received the 1st reports about cholera cases, in Blue Nile state. Since then, the disease spread in eastern Sudan, and later to the Northern State and central Sudan's El Gezira. In April 2017, sources in White Nile state reported a rapid spread of cholera. The disease then spread to North Kordofan, and fully hit Khartoum in May 2017, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan said in June 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of the Sudan can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Sudan> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96>.The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
