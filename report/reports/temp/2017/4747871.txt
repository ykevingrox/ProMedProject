However, mongoose rabies is a serious problem on the island of Grenada. In the late 1960s, Dr Chris Everard, a UK Medical Research Council staff member worked on rabies and the ecology of the mongoose in Grenada. He has written several papers, one of which was titled ""Ten Years of Rabies Surveillance in Grenada, 1968-1977"" in the ""Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organisation, 13 (4): 342-352 from which you can get other references. There is another good paper on ""The Biology of the Mongoose in the Caribbean"" by David Nellis and C.O.R Everard in ""Studies on the fauna of Curacao and other Caribbean Islands"" vol. LXIV: 162 p.Dr Everard died last year.Sent by: lisha Tikasingh--Merritt CliftonEditorAnimals 24-7POB 101, Greenbank, WA 98253USA<Animals24.7@frontier.com><http://www.Animals24-7.org>[In 1979-80 I was doing zoonotic research in the Caribbean and had the pleasure and privilege of knowing Chris Everard, based in Barbados, and a man fascinated by rabies and mongooses.
