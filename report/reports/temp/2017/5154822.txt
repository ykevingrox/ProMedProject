Emerging Infectious Diseases [in press] [edited]<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/8/17-0048_article>Human Infection with Burkholderia thailandensis, China, 2013------------------------------------------------------------_Burkholderia thailandensis_ is closely related to _B. pseudomallei_, the causative agent of melioidosis (1). _B. thailandensis_ shares most virulence factors and extensive genomic similarity with _B. pseudomallei_ but can be distinguished by its ability to assimilate arabinose and different rRNA sequences (2,3). Little is known about _B. thailandensis_ infection in humans. Two case reports described soft tissue infection and pneumonia with sepsis in Thailand and the USA (4,5). We describe a clinical investigation of human infection with _B. thailandensis_ in Chongqing, China.In October 2013, a 67-year-old man in Chongqing was hospitalized with a 13-day history of fever, productive cough with white sputum, and shortness of breath. Symptoms had not improved after antimicrobial drug treatment at a local clinic. The patient denied contact with any sick persons and any environmental exposure. Empirical treatment with meropenem was used to prompt resolution of the patient's symptoms before culture results were received. During the 6-day treatment course, the patient was transferred to Chongqing Infectious Disease Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, his general condition worsened, and his family wished to have him close to home. He was discharged and died 2 days later.Laboratory evaluations of blood samples performed at the time of the patient's admission showed a leukocyte count of 20 720/microL with a markedly elevated 91.5 percent neutrophils, aspartate aminotransferase level of 75.5 U/L (reference range 15.0-40.0 U/L), alanine aminotransferase level of 85.0 U/L (reference range 9.0-50.0 U/L), interleukin-6 level of 352.1 pg/mL (reference range 0-7 pg/mL), and procalcitonin level of 24.37 ng/mL (reference range 0-0.25 ng/mL). A computed tomography scan of the patient's chest showed a thick-walled cavitary lesion at the posterior segment of the right upper lobe measuring 7.9 X 6.1 cm and multiple nodules in both lung fields (Figure 1 - for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL).On day 6 of the patient's hospitalization, we observed via microscopy that the positive blood culture contained many gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria (Figure 2, panel A). The colonies were smooth and glossy, with silver pigmentation, on sheep blood agar (Figure 2, panel B). The VITEK 2 COMPACT system (bioMerieux, Marcy L'Epermiltoile, France) identified the isolated strain as _B. pseudomallei_ (97 percent probability; bionumber 0003451513500211). The API 20NE system (bioMerieux) also identified the isolated strain as _B. pseudomallei_ (50.5 percent probability; index 1157577). However, the biochemical profiles of the API 20NE system, including arabinose assimilation, identified the isolated strain as _B. thailandensis_, based on the mode of artificial interpretation. We analyzed the 16S rDNA sequence of strain BPM with nucleotide BLAST (<https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi>) and found a 100 percent similarity with _B. thailandensis_ (GenBank accession nos. CP000085.1 and CP000086.1).These results indicate that commercially available phenotypic assays are not ideal for the identification of _B. thailandensis_, which has not yet been incorporated into the databases of identification systems (6,7). Moreover, the arabinose assimilation proved to be an effective, simple, and accurate method for differentiating _B. thailandensis_ from _B. pseudomallei_. When _B. pseudomallei_ is presumptively identified, arabinose assimilation should be emphasized in clinical laboratories.We compared the virulence of the isolated strain with _B. thailandensis_ E264 (strain ATCC 700388) in BALB/c mice. _B. thailandensis_ E264 is an environmental isolate from northeast Thailand. The clinically isolated _B. thailandensis_ from this study was defined as strain BPM. Groups of 5 mice were inoculated with a 7 log10 CFU of each isolate and observed for a period of 7 days after infection. A total of 4 fifths of the mice infected with strain BPM died within 1 week of challenge. _B. thailandensis_ could be isolated from the bloodstream of mice at the time of death. In contrast, all mice with _B. thailandensis_ E264 infection survived over a 1-week monitoring period (Figure, panel A). The histologic findings were notable for early dissemination to the liver and lung (Figure, panel B). We observed multiple large, necrotizing foci in the livers of mice infected with strain BPM and alveolar-based neutrophilic inflammation in the strain BPM infection group. In addition, the inflammatory infiltrate and lung hyperemia were raised in the BPM-infected mice. This finding is consistent with the clinical case in our study, which appeared as pneumonia and sepsis. Overall, these experiments confirm that strain BPM is a virulent pathogen.We performed comparative genomics to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of strain BPM. The BPM strain and _B. thailandensis_ species share a large proportion of virulence factors. When compared with the reference genome sequences of _B. thailandensis_ E264, _B. thailandensis_ 2002721723, and _B. thailandensis_ E444, the specific virulence factors of VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system, HSI-I, and WcbR were indicated in strain BPM (Table) (8-10). These specific virulence factors may represent a transition toward a new virulent form.In conclusion, when considering _B. pseudomallei_ infection, clinicians should also consider the possibility of _B. thailandensis_ infection. _B. thailandensis_ is not identified with use of commercially available phenotypic assays and may be mistaken for _B. pseudomallei_. In the future, deep analysis of the complete genome would be helpful in understanding the evolution of _B. thailandensis_ and its adaptation to the environment.References----------1.

As has been the case with _Elizabethkingia anophelis_ which caused an outbreak over the winter of 2015-2016 primarily in southeast Wisconsin in the USA which is quite difficult to distinguish from _E. meningoseptica_, _B. thailandensis_ is readily misidentified as _B. pseudomallei_ so the number of cases, especially in areas where melioidosis is classically endemic, may be undercounted.Kespichayawattana W, Intachote P, Utaisincharoen P, Sirisinha S: Virulent _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is more efficient than avirulent _Burkholderia thailandensis_ in invasion of and adherence to cultured human epithelial cells. Microb Pathog. 2004;36: 287-292.Abstract--------""_Burkholderia pseudomallei_, a causative agent of melioidosis, is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacillus that is closely related to its avirulent counterpart, _Burkholderia thailandensis_. However, pathogenic mechanisms and virulence factors of _B. pseudomallei_ remain elusive. In the present study, we compared the invasiveness, adherence, and replication of _B. pseudomallei_ and _B. thailandensis_ in human respiratory epithelial cells A549. Invasion was determined after 4 h of coculturing using antibiotic protection assay. Adherence was demonstrated by coculturing the cells with fluorescein-labeled bacteria for 1 h and the number of positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The results obtained with this in vitro study demonstrated that compared with its avirulent counterpart, _B. pseudomallei_ is significantly more efficient (P<0.01) in invasion, adherence and inducing cellular damage, as represented by plaque formation.""Wongprompitak P, Sirisinha S, Chaiyaroj SC: Differential gene expression profiles of lung epithelial cells exposed to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and _Burkholderia thailandensis_ during the initial phase of infection. Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol. 2009: 59-70.Abstract--------""_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is the causative agent of melioidosis, and its infection usually affects patients' lungs. The organism is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacillus commonly found in soil and water in endemic tropical regions. Another closely related _Burkholderia_ species found in soil and water is _B. thailandensis_. This bacterium is a non-pathogenic environmental saprophyte. _B. pseudomallei_ is considerably more efficient than _B. thailandensis_ in host cell invasion and adherence. A previous study by our group demonstrated that after successfully invading cells, there was no difference in the ability to survive and to replicate between both _Burkholderia_ species in cultured A549 human lung epithelial cells. In this study, Human Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify the difference in gene expression profiles of A549 cells after a 2-h exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ and _B. thailandensis_. A total of 280 of 22 283 genes were expressed at higher levels in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells than in the _B. thailandensis_-infected cells, while 280 genes were expressed at lower levels in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells. Approximately 9 percent of these genes were involved in immune response and apoptosis. Those genes were further selected for gene expression analysis using reverse transcription PCR and/or real-time RT-PCR. The results of RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR are in accordance with data from the microarray data in that bcl2 gene expression in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells was 2-fold higher than the level in the _B. thailandensis_-infected cells even though no apoptosis was seen in the infected cells. The levels of E-selectin, ICAM-1, IL-11, IRF-1, IL-6, IL-1beta and LIF genes expression in the _B. pseudomallei_-infected cells were 1.5-5 times lower than in the _B. thailandensis_-infected cells. However, both species stimulated the same level of IL-8 production from the tested epithelial cell line, and no difference in the ratio of adherent polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to infected A549 cells of both species was observed. Taken together, our results suggest that _B. pseudomallei_ manipulates host response in favor of its survival in the host cell, which may explain the more virulent characteristics of _B. pseudomallei_ when compared with _B. thailandensis_."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
