FOX40 [edited]<http://fox40.com/2017/07/30/young-boy-hospitalized-after-swim-in-nevada-county-lake/>The family of a boy who was hospitalized for _Escherichia coli_ [infection] after swimming in a popular Northern California lake is speaking out. According to the Nevada County Public Health Department, 5 children have gotten sick -- 3 of them testing positive for _E. coli_. The county says all of them had been swimming at Lake Wildwood Beach near Grass Valley.The family of one boy spoke with FOX40 on [Sun 30 Jul 2017]. ""He started coming down with symptoms earlier this week, around Monday or Tuesday [24-25 Jul 2017]. Real upset stomach, digestive issues, blood in his stool,"" said the boy's aunt. The aunt said her sister, the boy's mother, took him to Lake Wildwood Beach last week [week of 17 Jul 2017] and they went swimming near the clubhouse -- a place the Nevada County Public Health Department believes exposed the boy and 4 others to _E. coli_. ""He was taken to Sierra Nevada Tue 25 Jul 2017, admitted to ICU [intensive care unit] shortly afterwards and was then was admitted to UC [University of California] Davis 29 Jul 2017 because he tested positive for _E. coli_ and it is now affecting his kidneys,"" the aunt said.The health department says 5 children became very ill, and 3 have now tested positive for _E. coli_. The aunt says her nephew knows at least one of the other sick boys, and she believes some adults are also being treated. ""They are friends, know each other. So they very well might have been there the same day. But, yeah, the mother's also pregnant, who is also affected, and her son,"" she said.The health department has closed down the beach after water tested there had high levels of fecal coliforms -- bacteria that can cause serious illness. There are wastewater treatment plants near the lake, but the county public works department said it didn't find any leaks and the system appears to be working normally. Lake Wildwood is a gated community. When FOX40 tried to speak with the administrative offices, a guard at the gate told us to check back [Mon 31 Jul 2017].FOX40 didn't see any swimmers at the lake [Sun 30 Jul 2017], but many people were boating and some were fishing.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9656>. Nevada county in central California can be seen on the map at <http://geology.com/county-map/california-county-map.gif>.Although it is not specifically stated, a cluster of illness blamed on an _E. coli_ with the development of kidney disease certainly suggests that enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is at work here, either the prototypic serotype O157:H7 or one of the other Shiga toxin-producing strains.EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food, the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock or wild animals or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.Swimming-associated transmission is illustrated in the following references:1.
