The report was received through an online/telephone system for reporting food service-associated illness complaints. Members of the 5 households in the party reported that their only shared exposure was the restaurant meal. CCPH ordered closure of the restaurant kitchen on 13 Jul 2016, and began an investigation to identify the source of diarrheal illness and implement additional control measures.CCPH defined a probable case of restaurant-associated illness as diarrhea lasting >2 days in any restaurant guest or staff member with illness onset from 1 Jul 2016 to 23 Jul 2016. After _Campylobacter jejuni_ was cultured from stool specimens submitted by 3 ill members of the dining party, a confirmed case was defined as culture evidence of _C. jejuni_ infection in any restaurant guest or staff member with onset of diarrheal illness during the same period. A total of 5 cases (3 confirmed and 2 probable) were identified, 4 in restaurant guests and one in a food worker; patient age ranged from 27-46 years; 3 patients were female.CCPH conducted a case-control study involving 28 menu items, using 14 non-ill dining companions and restaurant staff members as controls. Consumption of 2 menu items, chicken liver mousse (odds ratio [OR] = 36.1, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.58-828.9), and grilled romaine hearts (OR = 18, 95 percent CI = 1.19-271.5) were associated with case status. Because of the higher odds ratio of chicken liver mousse and previous _Campylobacter_ outbreaks associated with chicken livers (1,2), the investigation focused on the mousse.During an inspection on 15 Jul 2017, the sous-chef solely responsible for preparing the chicken liver mousse demonstrated preparation to the CCPH food safety inspector, who observed that the sous-chef used the appearance of the livers alone to determine whether they were fully cooked. Final internal cook temperature of the largest liver measured by the inspector was <130 degrees F (54 degrees C), below the minimum 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) internal temperature deemed necessary by the FDA to eliminate food safety hazards (3). Because raw chicken parts are not required to be free of _Campylobacter_ (4), and the bacteria might be present on the surface of 77 percent of retail chicken livers (5), CCPH immediately addressed undercooking of the livers.One patient stool specimen isolate was available for typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The PFGE pattern from this isolate was indistinguishable from those obtained from 2 chicken liver samples collected in a 2014 campylobacteriosis outbreak in Oregon (1). Chicken livers associated with both the 2014 outbreak and with this outbreak were supplied by the same company. Chicken livers from the lot served at the restaurant on the day of the implicated meal were no longer available; therefore, the U.S. Department of Agriculture could not pursue testing of chicken liver samples.Among published _C. jejuni_ outbreaks associated with undercooked chicken livers, this outbreak report is the 2nd from the Pacific Northwest (1), and the 1st in the USA initially reported through an illness complaint system. Because CCPH does not actively investigate _Campylobacter_ cases in persons aged >5 years, and because _Campylobacter_ PFGE is not routinely conducted in Washington, this outbreak would have likely gone undetected if not for the illness complaint system, demonstrating the value of illness complaint investigations to identify outbreaks and mitigate public health risks.

A query of PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, led to the identification of one additional case each from New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont that had been reported in the preceding 6 months. An investigation led by VDH found that all 6 patients had been exposed to raw or lightly cooked chicken livers that had been produced at the same Vermont poultry establishment (establishment A). Livers collected from this establishment yielded the outbreak strain of _C. jejuni_. In response, establishment A voluntarily ceased the sale of chicken livers on [9 Nov 2012]. A food safety assessment conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) found no major violations at the establishment. This is the 1st reported multistate outbreak of campylobacteriosis associated with chicken liver in the United States. Public health professionals, members of the food industry, and consumers should be aware that chicken livers often are contaminated with _Campylobacter_ and that fully cooking products made with chicken liver is the only way to prepare them so they are safe to eat."" Recently ProMED posted a cluster of similar cases from the UK (Campylobacteriosis - UK (03): (England) chicken liver pate Archive Number: 20170912.5311662). Interestingly, a UK report in the CDC Emerging Infectious Diseases journal in 2016 reported that many professional cooks prefer to prepare their chicken livers somewhat undercooked which increased the risk of campylobacteriosis:Jones AK, Rigby D, Burton M, et al: Restaurant cooking trends and increased risk for Campylobacter infection. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016;22: 1208-15. Available at:<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918174/>.Abstract--------""In the UK, outbreaks of _Campylobacter_ infection are increasingly attributed to undercooked chicken livers, yet many recipes, including those of top chefs, advocate short cooking times and serving livers pink. During 2015, we studied preferences of chefs and the public in the UK and investigated the link between liver rareness and survival of _Campylobacter_. We used photographs to assess chefs' ability to identify chicken livers meeting safe cooking guidelines. To investigate the microbiological safety of livers chefs preferred to serve, we modeled _Campylobacter_ survival in infected chicken livers cooked to various temperatures. Most chefs correctly identified safely cooked livers but overestimated the public's preference for rareness and thus preferred to serve them more rare. We estimated that 19-52 percent of livers served commercially in the United Kingdom fail to reach 70 C [approx160 F] and that predicted _Campylobacter_ survival rates are 48-98 percent. These findings indicate that cooking trends are linked to increasing _Campylobacter_ infections.""Perhaps alternative ways of cooking the chicken livers using a Bain Marie technique as reported here would be a better procedure:Hutchison M, Harrison D, Richardson I and Tchorzewska M: A method for the preparation of chicken liver pate that reliably destroys Campylobacters. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2015;12: 4652-69. Available at:<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454932/>.Abstract--------""This study devised a protocol for the manufacture of commercial quantities of chicken liver pate that reliably destroyed campylobacters. A literature search identified 40 pate manufacture recipes. Recipes stages with a potential to be antimicrobial were assembled to form a new protocol that included washing with organic acid, freeze-thaw and flambe in alcohol. Naturally-contaminated, high-risk livers were obtained from clearance flocks at slaughter and the effect of each stage of the protocol on _Campylobacter_ populations was determined. Organic acid washing changed the color of the liver surfaces. However, there were no significant differences between liver surface color changes when a range of concentrations of lactic acid and ethanoic acid washes were compared by reflective spectrophotometry. A 5 percent (w/v) acid wash reduced numbers of indigenous campylobacters by around 1.5 log 10 CFU/g for both acids. The use of a Bain Marie was found to more reproducibly apply heat compared with pan-frying. Antimicrobial recipe stages reduced the numbers of campylobacters, but not significantly if thermal processing was ineffective. Cooking to 63 C [approx. 145 F] was confirmed to be a critical control point for campylobacters cooked in a Bain Marie. Organoleptic and sensory assessment of pate determined an overall preference for pate made from frozen livers.""For those who are ""muggles"" of the food world, a Bain Marie (pronounced ""bahn ma ree"") is, in cooking, a receptacle containing warm water at a controlled temperature into which other containers are placed to warm or cook the food in them. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>.]
