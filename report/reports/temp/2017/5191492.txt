The virus is highly contagious and causes symptoms like stomachaches, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. It's the most common cause of food-borne illnesses in the USA with more than 21 million cases annually. Cases of norovirus stemming from restaurants can often involve a worker who failed to wash his or her hands after going to the bathroom.Chipotle has dealt with norovirus cases in the past.

About one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (<http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html>). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it's about one in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries, like the United States and Nicaragua. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus.Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season, but may also be associated with the birth rate. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/247>.]
