The Record [edited]<http://www.therecord.com/news-story/7200186-small-increase-in-mumps-cases-in-waterloo-region/>A total of 3 confirmed cases of the mumps have been reported in Waterloo Region (Ontario province) so far this year [2017], mirroring a widespread bump in the virus's activity.""It's definitely something people should be aware of, but the risk is pretty low because most of our population is immunized,"" said Kristy Wright, manager of infectious diseases for Region of Waterloo Public Health. ""There's no need to panic. We're quite used to having this cyclical activity with mumps."" There's been increased mumps activity across Ontario, as well as Canada and the United States.""It is circulating. There is sporadic activity,"" Wright said.In Guelph, there are 3 confirmed cases among university aged people linked to a keg party held in mid-January [2017]. Two more suspected cases are being followed.Toronto Public Health is investigating a mumps outbreak in the city. There were 43 confirmed cases by [Wed 15 Mar2017].Wright said people should check their immunization records to ensure they've received 2 mumps vaccines, which is needed for optimal protection. The 1st dose is given around the 1st birthday, and the 2nd between 4 and 6. Some people only received 1 dose as a child. They can get a 2nd dose now.Those most affected by the recent spike in mumps activity are people 17 -- 35 years old. It's thought the longer the time from the 2nd dose, the more susceptible a person may be.""We do see some waning effect, especially as you get older,"" Wright said.The virus is spread through droplets and requires close contact. That can include sharing drinks, kissing, and coughing or sneezing within 1 meter.""It tends to be a very social age group,"" Wright said. ""That might contribute to spread among that age group.""Symptoms include fever, headache, and swelling in the salivary glands, Wright said. ""There are a lot of people who just have respiratory symptoms.""Complications such as meningitis are possible but rare, and most people are better in about a week.Mumps activity goes in cycles and, fortunately, large outbreaks are rare because of high immunization rates, Wright said. Last year [2016], there was one case in the region. ""And in other years we have none at all,"" she said.The virus has a long incubation period, upwards of 25 days before symptoms appear.""You can be contagious but not show any symptoms,"" said Chuck Ferguson, spokesperson for the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. He said the department is watching to see if anyone in contact with the current cases develops mumps to know if it's spreading in the community and who is at risk.[Byline: Johanna Weidner]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap showing the location of Ontario Province, Canada, can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>]******[3] Canada (Ontario, Toronto)Date: Thu 23 Mar 2017 3:18PM EDTSource: CTV News Toronto [edited]<http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/mumps-outbreak-in-toronto-grows-to-62-cases-1.3338044>An outbreak of the mumps is continuing to spread in the city of Toronto as the number of confirmed cases has grown to 62.In a news release issued [Thu 23 Mar 2017], Toronto Public Health said that most of the cases are among people between the ages of 18 and 35 years old. As well, 5 of these cases have been linked to elementary and high schools in Toronto, either among staff or students.""All of the cases related to Toronto school settings acquired the mumps from close contact with a known individual who already had the mumps and not from the school setting,"" Toronto Public Health said in the news release.Ryerson University confirmed 2 cases of the mumps on campus earlier this week [week of 19 March 2017]. The other schools affected include King Edward Public School, Hodgson Senior Public School and Forest Hill Collegiate.Toronto Public Health said the initial outbreak began in February [2017] when the number of cases hovered around 14, but that number has grown ever since. Originally, the outbreak was linked to bars and restaurants in the city's west-end, particularly between Queen Street and King Street from Spadina Avenue to Dufferin Street.In Thursday's news release, Toronto Public Health said that broader community spread of the mumps is now occurring in Toronto.The mumps is a viral infection which is typically found in saliva and respiratory droplets. It is spread through coughing, sneezing and coming into contact with a person's saliva by sharing drinks or utensils, food or water bottles, or by kissing.Furthermore, a major factor contributing to outbreaks of this infection is being in a crowded environment or being in close quarters consistently with a person who has the mumps.Symptoms for the virus include fever, swelling of one or more salivary glands, loss of appetite, tiredness, and headache.In more severe cases, mumps can produce an infection in the brain, painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, pancreatitis or hearing loss.Toronto Public Health is urging residents of the city to call their doctor to ensure they are properly immunized. Those born between 1970 and 1992, in particular, should check their records as they may have only received 1 of the 2 necessary doses as a child.[Byline: Kayla Goodfield]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] USA (Illinois)Date: Wed 22 Mar 2017 5:15 AMSource: Daily Herald [edited]<http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20170322/news/170329654/>Station Middle School now has 3 confirmed cases of the mumps, making it the 2nd Barrington Area Unit School District 220 school to have an outbreak of the disease, district officials said [Tue 21 Mar 2017]. At Barrington High, the number of confirmed mumps cases increased to 6, and Superintendent Brian Harris said it could eventually go to as high as 10.""I wouldn't be surprised,"" said Harris at the board of education meeting at Barrington High [Tue 21 Mar 2017] night. ""Ten reported cases out of approximately 3500 people who are in and out of this building every day is still well below the public health information that talks about the effectiveness of vaccines.""According to the CDC (Centers for disease Control and Prevention), the mumps component of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses.The district has been getting updates on the slow spread of the disease via daily 3 p.m. conference calls with the Lake County Health Department.""I do believe our school community has responded appropriately and diligently in all regards,"" Harris said. ""I do believe that is part of the reason why we've seen so many reporting, I think parents and students are following up as we asked.""The Lake County Health Department updates their website daily with the latest number of confirmed, probable and suspected mumps cases.On [Mon 13 Mar 2017], the health department held a vaccination clinic for Barrington High School staff and students who were not up to date with their MMR vaccinations. Harris said 85 staff members took advantage of the opportunity. He said students likely didn't take advantage because more than 99 percent of them have received 2 MMR vaccines already. Adults born after 1957 and before 1989 were only required to get one MMR vaccine, so Harris said the staff members used the clinic to get a 2nd dose.Harris said there will be a similar clinic offered to staff and students and Station Middle School in the coming weeks.When new confirmed cases trickle in, it means the districts small number of students who are unvaccinated for religious or medical reasons have to spend more and more time away from the student population. The district has been helping those students continue their education from home in a variety of ways, including having access to coursework through their school-issued laptops. Harris said they are also inviting the students to come in and receive one-on-one instruction after school for things like tests and time learning in the lab. The schools are thoroughly cleaned each night to health department specifications.Mumps is a serious contagious disease. Common symptoms are fever, headache and muscle aches, though up to half of people who get it have mild or no symptoms.[Byline: Doug T.

Last week [week of 12 March] the agency reported 5 cases, and Marysville schools sent home an advisory letter to parents to watch for symptoms and to isolate potential cases. Health officials urge people who think they have symptoms to stay home and to contact a physician.Symptoms include a few days of fever, headache, muscle ache, fatigue and loss of appetite followed by swollen salivary glands.Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued a [Thu 9 Mar 2017] letter to the Kansas USA Wrestling organization, which is a community of youth wrestling events, to notify them that mumps transmission has been documented at several wrestling tournaments in Kansas.KDHE ""has not identified all of the sources of these mumps infections,"" the letter says. ""This means that additional, yet-to-be-identified kids or adults may still spread the disease at other wrestling events.""People who suspect they have mumps should stay home from work, school and any social or athletic activities including wresting tournaments and practices, health officials said in the letter.Mumps outbreaks have been documented in several Kansas counties this winter. Some surrounding states have also had a number of cases, according to KDHE.Mumps is caused by a virus and spreads through close contact with an infected person. Mumps can occasionally cause complications, including inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, meningitis, encephalitis and deafness. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks.In addition to staying isolated when a person has mumps, the spread of virus can be prevented by: - Washing hands often with soap and water. - Covering mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and putting used tissue in the trash can. If no tissue is available, a person can cough or sneeze into the upper sleeve or elbow, not the hands. - Avoiding sharing drinks or eating utensils. - Disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, such as toys, doorknobs, tables, counters.After the introduction of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, mumps became less common in the United States, KDHE reports. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease.Some people who receive 2 doses of MMR can still get mumps, especially when they have prolonged, close contact with someone who has the disease. If a vaccinated person does get mumps, he or she will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person. Therefore the best way to reduce the chance of getting the disease is by being vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.[Byline: Sarah Kessinger]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap of Kansas, United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/219>]******[6] USA (Washington, Seattle)Date: Thu 23 Mar 2017 7:18 pmSource: Seattle Times [edited]<http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/mumps-outbreak-spreads-to-uw-greek-system/>Washington's mumps outbreak, the worst this decade, has spread to the fraternities and sororities at the University of Washington.Those cases were concentrated in the Greek system, according to an email from the UW Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases, and ""we anticipate the number of cases among UW students will increase more broadly as the outbreak continues in King County and across Washington state.""The UW advised those infected, or with symptoms, to stay home.Statewide, 664 cases of mumps have been reported since October [2016], according to the state Department of Health (DOH). That far surpasses the 53 cases in 2007, the previous high this decade. The last time the state saw such high numbers was 1977, David Johnson of DOH said.The mumps virus can cause fever, headache, swelling of the cheeks and jaw, muscle aches and testicular pain and swelling. In rare cases, mumps can lead to more serious complications, such as sterility. Most people recover from mumps in a few weeks.It is spread, particularly in crowded environments, through coughing, sneezing, kissing and other close contact, such as sharing food, drinks and cigarettes.Colleges have been hot spots for mumps outbreaks in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Health officials say getting vaccinated is the best defense against mumps.The recommended dose of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, varies by age. For children ages 1 to 5, it's 1 dose, Johnson said. The same goes for adults 20 to 59 years old. For those 5 to 19 years old, 2 doses are recommended.Most people born before 1957, when mumps was more widespread, probably were infected and have natural immunity.[Byline: Bob Young]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[7] Analysis: USA (Arkansas) outbreakDate: Wed 22 Mar 2017 7:35 PM ETSource: NPR Shots [edited]<http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/22/520842043/social-media-math-and-the-mystery-of-a-mumps-outbreak>In August 2016, an outbreak of mumps began in Arkansas. Since then, there have been nearly 3000 cases of the disease across 33 counties in the state.As a public health practitioner, I wondered: Why did this outbreak take off?My team at HealthMap, a computational epidemiology lab based out of Boston Children's Hospital, began by rounding up as much data as we could.We quickly discovered that the Arkansas Department of Health was releasing semi-regular PDF reports on the outbreak. The reports broke down cases by county, age and school district (many of the people who have contracted mumps in the Arkansas outbreak are children). But there were no historical archives that could give us a sense of how the outbreak had grown over time.So we turned to a tool called the HealthMap Digital Surveillance System, which collects social media reports and news about public health issues around the world and turns them into usable epidemiological data. (For example, this blog previously reported on how we used our surveillance system to collect Google search and participatory public health data to track and predict flu outbreaks.)From the HealthMap data about the mumps outbreak, we were able to estimate the total number of cases that had occurred since August 2016.At that point, we had all the information we needed to tackle a more difficult question: What could the data tell us about vaccination in communities affected by the outbreak?Before we get to our answer to that question, let's talk about mumps.Mumps, like measles and rubella, is extremely contagious. Because of this, the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine is given in 2 doses. Even with both doses, the vaccine is imperfect. One out of every 10 individuals who receives it remains susceptible to the mumps virus. In the event of a mumps outbreak, some people who get sick will be people who were vaccinated; how many depends on what percentage of the people in the affected community are vaccinated.For a disease as contagious as mumps, a two-dose community-level vaccination rate as high as 96 percent may be necessary to prevent active transmission of the virus, maintaining so-called herd immunity. When the vaccination rate drops, herd immunity breaks down and outbreaks can take off.The Arkansas Department of Health doesn't generally report high-resolution vaccination statistics to the public. But it has been collecting self-reported data on vaccination from individuals who were diagnosed with mumps during this particular outbreak. In the department's latest report, an average of about 70 percent of people who got mumps said they had received both doses of the mumps vaccine.However, studies have shown that self-reported vaccination rates are typically 1.5 to 2 times greater than actual vaccination rates. This means that the true two-dose vaccination rate among mumps cases in Arkansas was probably closer to 35 percent to 46 percent.But what about vaccination rates in the larger communities that these cases came from?After pairing our surveillance data with mathematical modeling methods, we estimated that the average two-dose vaccination rate in communities affected by the outbreak was likely no higher than 89 percent and may have been as low as 70 percent, well below that ideal rate of 96 percent.Our complete methodology can be found in a study published [Thu 23 Mar 2017] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases (see reference below).As vaccine hesitancy gains ground in the United States, we place ourselves at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, mumps and rubella. While these childhood illnesses aren't fatal to most people, those who are most susceptible to serious adverse effects, such as children under the age of 1 and cancer patients, are often those who can't be vaccinated.And this is why herd immunity is so important. When we vaccinate, we protect not only ourselves but the most vulnerable members of our communities, too.[Byline: Maimuna Majumder]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>
