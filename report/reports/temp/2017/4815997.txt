Global Times [edited]<http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1031333.shtml>The Brazilian government announced [Fri 3 Feb 2017] that the number of confirmed deaths caused by a yellow fever outbreak has reached 60, while 87 more suspicious deaths are being investigated.In a statement, the Health Ministry said that 53 of the deaths had come in the state of Minas Gerais, where the outbreak started before spreading to other states. In Espirito Santo 4 people have died and 3 more in the state of Sao Paulo.Since the start of the outbreak, 150 deaths were potentially attributed of yellow fever, 60 of which have been confirmed, 87 are still under investigation and 3 have been eliminated.In total, 921 people have been suspected of being infected, 804 of which happened in Minas Gerais. 702 are being investigated, 161 have been confirmed and 58 have been ruled out.The rise in the number of cases forced the government to dispatch over 8 million doses of vaccine to at-risk states to try and contain the crisis.The disease is carried by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which is also a vector for dengue, chikungunya and the Zika virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Fortunately, none of the reports from the outbreak have indicated that these are cases of urban, _Aedes aegypti_ transmitted yellow fever (YF). They are spill-over of sylvan (forest) YF transmitted among monkeys by _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ species of mosquitoes. One hopes that the initiation of the YF vaccination campaigns in the affected areas will bring this outbreak to an end.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4517>. - Mod.TY]******[2] PAHO/WHODate: Thu 2 Feb 2017Source: PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update Yellow Fever [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=37953&lang=en>Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------In 2017, as of 2 Feb [2017] yellow fever cases have been confirmed in Brazil, whereas Colombia and Peru have only reported probable cases.In Brazil, between [Thu 1 Dec 2016 and Thu 2 Feb 2017], 901 cases of yellow fever were reported (151 confirmed, 42 discarded, and 708 suspected cases remain under investigation),including 143 deaths (54 confirmed, 3 discarded, and 86 under investigation). The overall case fatality rate (CFR) is 16 percent, with 36 percent CFR among confirmed cases and 12 percent CFR among suspected cases.According to the probable site of infection, the suspected and confirmed cases are distributed in 5 states: Bahia (10 cases), Espirito Santo (67), Minas Gerais (802), SÌ£o Paulo (7), and Tocantins (4). The case fatality rate of suspected and confirmed cases in the state of Espirito Santo is 12 percent, in Minas Gerais is 16 percent, and in SÌ£o Paulo is 43 percent [Note: the number of cases is small in SÌ£o Paulo].The confirmed cases are distributed in 3 states: Espirito Santo (13 cases), Minas Gerais (134), and SÌ£o Paulo (4). Of the confirmed cases, 50 percent were men between 31 and 50 years of age. With regard to the confirmed deaths, 48 occurred in the state of Minas Gerais, 3 in the state of SÌ£o Paulo and 3 in the state of Espirito Santo.Figure 1.

To date, 259 of them were yellow fever confirmed.Epizootics in NHP were reported in the states of Roraima (bordering Venezuela), Tocantins, GoiÌÁs, Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espirito Santo, SÌ£o Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul (bordering Argentina), Rio Grande do Norte, ParanÌÁ (bordering Argentina and Paraguay), and the Federal District (Figure3). The occurrence of epizootics in Roraima (bordering Venezuela) as well as in Mato Grosso do Sul and ParanÌÁ (bordering Argentina and Paraguay) represent a risk of circulation of the virus tothe bordering countries, especially in areas where they share the same ecosystem.Figure 3. Distribution of yellow fever epizootics, Brazil, 1 Dec 2016 - 2 Feb 2017(Source: Brazil Ministry of Health)In response to this situation, public health authorities at the federal, state and municipal levels are implementing various activities, including the distribution of 7.8 million vaccines to the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, SÌ£o Paulo, Bahia, and Rio de Janeiro. At this moment, there is no evidence that _Aedes aegypti_ is implicated in the transmission of ongoing outbreaks. However, the potential risk of re-urbanization cannot be ruled out.Recommendations---------------The Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/ WHO) recommends Member States continue efforts to detect, confirm, and appropriately treat cases of yellow fever in a timely manner and in a context of circulation of various arboviruses. Member States are encouraged to keep health care personnel up-to-date and trained to detect and treat cases especially in well-known areas of virus circulation.The most important yellow fever prevention measure is vaccination. Preventive vaccination can be carried out through systematic immunization in childhood or through unique mass campaigns to increase vaccination coverage in risk areas and also through vaccination of those traveling to at-risk areas.The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 - 100 percent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 percent immunity after 30 days. A single dose is sufficient to confer immunity and protection for life, without the need for booster doses. Severe side effects are extremely rare.Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines, it is recommended that national authorities conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in risk areas in order to focus the distribution of vaccines. In addition, it is recommended to keep a stock of vaccines at a national level to respond to possible outbreaks.PAHO/WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to countries with ongoing outbreaks of yellow fever.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The geographically scattered cases illustrate the wide-spread distribution of yellow fever virus around Brazil with risk of cases in other parts of tropical South America. One hopes that countries neighboring Brazil are insuring that their residents are immunized against YF, as should be visitors to all these areas before traveling.Readers interested in seeing the graphs, map and references in the above report are urged to access its URL. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
