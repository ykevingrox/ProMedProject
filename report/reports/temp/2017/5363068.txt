This was stated by the Health Director of the ASL of Taranto, Stefano Rossi. ""The immigrants who are hospitalized in the Hospital of Moscati Hospital in Taranto and who have been diagnosed with malaria after lab tests, have been in Italy for 2 months now. The incubation time of malaria ranges from 15 days to a month, so it follows that the disease was contracted here,"" Rossi continued.The patients are all of Moroccan nationality: they worked throughout the summer as agricultural laborers in a town of Ginosa called Pantano. ""Since malaria is contracted through mosquitoes, it is obvious that an assessment of the working conditions of these migrants should be made. It is clear that the disease has contracted here and they have not brought it here from where they came from. The assessment assumes that mosquitoes have been caught and sent to the Istituto Zooprofilatica Institute for further analysis,"" said the Health Director of Asl Tarantina. The 4 immigrants had symptoms of the disease a few days ago, but only today [Tue 3 Oct 2017], after some analysis carried out in collaboration with the Bari Police Department, was there a confirmation that it was malaria.The 4 patients have been diagnosed with _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria. They have been farm workers in Italy for several years and reside in the Ginosa countryside (2 live in the same housing) and are between 21 and 37 years old. The Health Director of Asl Tarantina explains in a note that ""all 4 cases would have been fatal without treatment. The symptoms were vomiting and diarrhea, and in some cases headache and abdominal pain; all had low platelets and splenomegaly."" The situation, he adds, is ""fully under the control of the local Health Care Company and there are no health or social concerns. At present, 3 of the 4 patients are completely out of the danger, while one is confused and still needs supportive therapy.""[Byline: Claudio del Frate]--Communicated by:Pasquale UrbanoFormerly: Dept of Public Health, University of Florence<pasquale.urbano@unifi.it>[ProMED thanks Pasquale Urbano for alerting us to these cases.The patients visited Morocco approximately 2 months before the diagnosis of _P.falciparum_ malaria. However, Morocco has not reported autochthonous malaria since 2007 (World Malaria Report 2016, p.48 <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/252038/1/9789241511711-eng.pdf>) which excludes that they were infected in Morocco.It is stated in the text that the incubation period is around 2 weeks, which is correct for non-immune persons. For individuals living in highly malaria endemic areas, clinical immunity develops and parasitemia can be asymptomatic for several years. However, coming from Morocco these people most probably did not have preexisting immunity and therefore it must be assumed that they were infected proximately 2 weeks before the symptoms developed.There are 2 possibilities:I. Airport malaria where mosquitoes infected with malaria enter a plane and exit the plane at its destination biting the closest human being. Thus the distance from an international airport and the farm where the 4 workers work is essential. The flight range of mosquitoes are usually within a 1 km (approx. 0.6 mi) but can be more depending on the wind.II. Infection of the local mosquitoes by a gametocyte carrier. Individuals from highly endemic areas can be asymptomatic carriers of malaria and can infect the local mosquitoes. The temperature has to be in average over 20 deg C (68 deg F) for the falciparum gametocytes to develop into sporozoites, and that was the case (see data at <https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/taranto/214970/september-weather/214970>).Thus the investigation must look for potential individuals from tropical Africa present in the area up to 1 months before the patients developed symptoms. The _Anopheles_ in Southern Italy could be _An. maculipennis atroparvus_ or _An. labranchaiae_, both of which can transmit _P. falciparum_ (Shute PG & Mayron M. A study of human malaria oocysts as an aid to species diagnosis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 1952; 46:275-92). Thus the investigation needs to be extended to identifying individuals from malaria endemic areas living near the farm in the month of September [2017]. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46219>.]
