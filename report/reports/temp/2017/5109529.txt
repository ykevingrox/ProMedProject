Mod.AB, edited]<http://www.reflexiondz.net/RELIZANE-Une-vache-atteinte-de-rage-seme-la-panique-a-Zedairia_a47537.html>A cow reported to be rabid in the Zedairia area of Relizane province caused panic among residents of Zedairia hamlet. Indeed, the information was conveyed via 'vox populi', indicating the presence of a rabid cow belonging to a breeder resident in the vicinity of a dense forest. According to preliminary information, the animal was bitten by another animal that would have carried the virus, presumably a dog or a wild animal wandering around the area.Immediately alerted, the municipal health services, supported by a veterinarian, quickly began an investigation to locate the origin of the contamination of the affected cow. In addition, a medical investigation was launched in the suspect areas, the inhabitable areas of the municipality and throughout its immediate surroundings.--Communicated by:ProMED-MENApromed-mena@promedmail.org[This case of bovine rabies appeared in a cow raised near a dense forest, that would have been bitten by a domestic or wild carnivore that remains to be determined through the undertaken investigation. Other cases of animal rabies could be discovered during this investigation. - Mod.ABMaps of Algeria can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Algeria.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2034>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] India: nationwide human cases compiled, 2014-2016Date: Wed 14 Jun 2017 05.07 PM ISTSource: Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/16-succumbed-to-rabies-in-gujarat-in-2014-16/articleshow/59144755.cms>Rabies claimed 16 lives in Gujarat between 2014 and 2016 as the state ranked 5th among 29 states and 7 union territories including national capital territory of Delhi. As per the figures given by the Union Health Ministry, India has reported 324 fatalities due to animal bite. Gujarat reported 7 deaths in 2014 and 8 in 2015, respectively. The figures came down in 2016 when the state reported only 1 death due to rabies. With 146 deaths, West Bengal reported highest number of deaths due to rabies followed by Delhi (39), Jharkhand (34) and Madhya Pradesh (23).Meanwhile Kerala reported 14 deaths followed by Odisha (12), Uttarakhand (6), Assam (5) and Bihar (5). Sources in the Gujarat health department said that the deaths must have occurred due to dog bites in various parts of the state. Ahmedabad city has also been facing the everlasting problems of stray dog menace as it reports an average of 600 cases of dog bites in every week. In wake of the rise in dog bites, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials decided to set a target of 1000 dog sterilizations a month for each of the 4 agencies working for the civic body.[Byline: Ashish Chauhan]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the report above, ""As per the figures given by the Union Health Ministry, India has reported 324 fatalities due to animal bite"". Is this figure related to the year 2014, as may be assumed by the structure of the text? otherwise?India's human rabies statistics have been subject to discussions in the past, and are certainly in need of elucidation. The official annual number of human fatalities has been counted in 3-figure numbers, while 5-figure numbers are generally cited by international organisations. Subscribers are referred to the 2015 thread of discussions on the matter in several ProMED-mail's postings in a 2015 thread (see postings listed below), Mod.MHJ's comment, at the time, is applicable: ""Patently, we have a definition difference for a case of human rabies in a situation where public health records are not as rigorous as one might hope for, though the pathology is sound. But I think we can agree that if canine rabies were properly controlled in India, as it has been in many countries, it would cease to be a public health problem or even a veterinary problem. This is long, long overdue.""For further reading and several references related to India's rabies statistics, subscribers are specifically referred to 20151028.3748032 and to the review paper in Ref 1.Reference----------Taylor LH, Nel LH.

On [25 Mar 2017], he developed full-blown rabies infection and died 5 days later.""Apart from the scratch he suffered in 2006, the man had not come in contact with any animal bite. Besides, he did not have any associated illness and physiological condition,"" a state health official said.The jawan, originally from Maharashtra's Aurangabad district, developed rabies symptoms on [17 Mar 2017]. Initially, he took Ayurvedic treatment from doctor in his village. As his condition worsened, he was admitted to the Military Hospital in Aurangabad on [23 Mar 2017]. He was referred to Command Hospital in Pune on [24 Mar 2017] where he was admitted in the isolation ward with a history of abnormal behaviour, fever, and possible hydrophobia (fear of water).The death has revived the debate on rabies' average incubation period, which is generally believed to be is 30-60 days in humans.Experts said that although it is rare to have a long incubation period, medical literature suggests that although there have been cases where the infection has developed even after 14 to 19 years. They suggested that people should not ignore casual licks, scratches, or bites from an unvaccinated pet. Besides, they should immunise their pet against rabies every year.[Byline: Umesh Isalkar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>The report does not mention laboratory confirmation of the fatal rabies case described. In case laboratory confirmed, the patient's anamnesis deserves to be thoroughly studied, relatives/acquaintances preferably involved, to exclude possible exposure to rabies during the past year. An 11-year incubation period for rabies is highly exceptional, to say the least.The following commentary by Mod.DK, published in response to a human case in Nepal said to had undergone a 53 year incubation period (see 20151115.3791390), is applicable here: ""Such incubation period is so long that a healthy bit of skepticism seems appropriate. At a minimum, we need 2 additional pieces of evidence: 1) viral isolation as a proof of diagnosis; and 2) genetic evaluation of the virus to determine its origin, such as dog or bat, etc. Even if it is of dog origin, a minor exposure over such a long duration could have been forgotten such as petting a dog with saliva on its fur."" - Mod.AS
