The number of patients who arrived that day reached 84, including 24 patients that were attended at a hospital in Essalud.The local emergency and observation offices of the Ministry of Health were saturated by the number of patients who arrived from dawn until the afternoon. They had severe stomach pains, cramps, fever, vomiting and diarrhea. The most serious patients were a pregnant woman and several children who could not tolerate the pain. To the surprise of the director of the hospital, Antonio Llamosas Ampuero, the patients reported that they attended a barbeque organized by a family in the sector of the Dehesa, where 200 dishes were sold.This activity was organized by the family to buy medicines and materials to save the father's limbs, which were damaged in an accident. He is hospitalized at Honorio Delgado Hospital. They said they bought the poultry meat on [Fri 7 Apr 2017] and kept it to prepare the meals on [Sat 8 Apr 2017].Laboratory doctors indicated that the people who consumed the chicken were infected by the bacterium _Salmonella_, which directly affected the digestive system and caused the loss of fluid, fever, body aches and vomiting. Another 24 patients were also treated at the Samuel Pastor de la Pampa hospital in Essalud, with the same symptoms. They also ate the chicken. Officials are investigating whether the family had a freezer and whether the necessary care and precautions were taken.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed@promedmail.org>[No doubt that undercooked poultry or poor kitchen hygiene can cause a substantial outbreak of salmonellosis. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4955>.]
