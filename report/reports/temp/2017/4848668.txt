New Era [edited]<https://www.newera.com.na/2017/02/17/22-leprosy-cases-reported/>Namibia recorded about 22 leprosy cases between January and November last year [2016], of which 7 were from Oshana. Four new cases were detected in pregnant women in Omusati between June 2016 and February 2017. Between 1994 and 2014, 226 cases were recorded, with many of the cases recorded in 2010 and 2013. This revelation came at the 5th commemoration of World Leprosy Day held at Ongwediva on Thursday [16 Feb 2017].Despite the number of leprosy cases detected, many patients are not diagnosed in a timely manner, speakers at the event attested. Equally, some patients frequent the hospital for up to 4 years without receiving the correct diagnosis, and health workers instead treat them for diabetes and hypertension amongst other diseases. Daniel Drake, a doctor from Omusati Region appealed to health workers to perform skin biopsies on patients who showed leprosy symptoms to ensure timely diagnoses and avoid deformities.A person transmits leprosy when he or she comes into contact with another person who then goes untreated for over a year. It is transmitted through nose and mouth droplets.Also speaking at the event, a leprosy patient, LK, appealed to health authorities to make leprosy medication accessible at clinics to cut the vast distances people have to travel to procure such medicines from the hospital. LK like many other patients has been going to the hospital for about 3 years, but remained undiagnosed. ""I 1st went to the Onandjokwe hospital in 2013, but I was only given medicine and was sent home. And for years, I would go to the hospital where health workers would prescribe medicine, until 2016 when a doctor decided to take a skin biopsy,"" LK said. LK experienced tiredness, excessive sweating while sleeping, and limb stiffness.Oshana Health Director Johanna Haimene said the national TB and Leprosy programme, which set strategies to fight the 2 diseases, is busy finalizing the 3rd midterm strategic plan, and leprosy is a priority. ""Yes, we can beat leprosy as a country, and our latest statistics show that,"" Haimene said. Haimene represented the Minister of Health and Social Services at the event.The Governor of Oshana Region, Clemens Kashuupulwa, said that although we had made progress in the fight against leprosy, the country needed to enhance prevention and care strategies. ""Therefore, as citizens and multi-sectoral stakeholders, we need to develop and implement prevention strategies and interventions that yield high impact and are cost effective,"" Kashuupulwa said. He further called on the community to end the stigmatisation and exclusion of leprosy patients from social life. ""Leprosy can be defeated, and those who have been cured of it can go back to living a normal life,"" Kashuupulwa added.They commemorated the event under the theme ""I am loved, I have hope, but I need your help.""[Byline: Nuusita Ashipala]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[WHO collects information from national leprosy programs annually about the prevalence of leprosy (i.e., the number of patients on treatment at a particular point of time, usually 31 December), new cases detected, and treatment completion. In 2015, 136 countries submitted annual leprosy statistics. No reports were received from 92 countries or territories, including Namibia, in 2015. Reports from Namibia were also not received by WHO in 2012-2014. Namibia reported a prevalence of 4, 42, 39 cases and an incidence of 4, 42, 6 new cases in 2009, 2010, 2011, respectively (<http://www.who.int/wer/2010/wer8535.pdf?ua=1>, <http://www.who.int/wer/2011/wer8636.pdf?ua=1>, <http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8734.pdf?ua=1>). None of the new cases were children in any of these years; leprosy in children would indicate ongoing transmission in the community. Most likely the differences in incidence from year to year represent variability recognizing the disease by clinicians, reporting, or case finding.According to WHO (<http://www.aho.afro.who.int/profiles_information/index.php/Namibia:Analytical_summary_-_Neglected_tropical_diseases>): ""Despite Namibia having reached the leprosy elimination target of less than one case per 10 000 inhabitants nationally, there are still pockets of the disease, particularly in Caprivi and Kavango regions. Following a WHO-supported assessment in 2009, 4 new cases were identified, adding to the 22 cases reported in 2007 and 2008.""Namibia (formerly German South-West Africa), is a country in southern Africa, bordered on the west by the Atlantic Ocean (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia>).
