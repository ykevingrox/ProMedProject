But with the potential for 8 cases in students, KDHE decided this week [week of Sun 22 Apr 2017] to declare an outbreak. Baugher said health department personnel are tracking the cases to find connections among patients and try to find the source.The disease was 1st found in a high school student, but most of the recent victims are from middle-school age students at Meadow View Grade School. Baugher said a 4 month old infant [had been] admitted to Labette Health with pertussis. A family member who attends Labette County High School and had been exposed to the disease was in the presence of the infant. The infant was born with respiratory issues and was too young to be fully vaccinated.Testing continues for suspected cases, but results have been slow to come back. Baugher said her department worked with KDHE, where cultures are tested, and arranged to reduce that delay for those who get the pertussis test at the hospital's lab. Baugher said the tests had been returning in 5 to 6 days. ""If they take a 5-day treatment they're already done with the treatment before we know what caused it,"" Baugher said. Because of the outbreak, KDHE has agreed to test cultures immediately when the hospital lab calls ahead. ""As soon as they get it they test it, so we have a much shorter turn-around time. So we cut it about in half.""Baugher said as soon as the health department is able to connect the cases, KDHE will quit testing. At that point, if a patient presents at a doctor's office with symptoms, he or she is given a 5-day dose of antibiotic. ""Right now they still want to test because we don't quite have the connections,"" Baugher said.[byline: Ray Nolting]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Labette County, with a population of 21 607 residents, is located in the south eastern portion of the US state of Kansas; its most populous city is Parsons (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labette_County,_Kansas>).

The disease has moved through several schools in Grant County this week [week of Sun 22 Apr 2017]. As the number of cases grows, so does concern. Those in charge of running Grant County schools are putting the word out to parents Friday night [28 April 2017] about pertussis.As of mid-afternoon Friday [28 Apr 2017, presumably. - Mod.SH], there were 25 cases in Grant County, according to the Northern Kentucky Health Department. ""The vast majority are in Grant County schools,"" said Emily Wherle, a spokeswoman for the health department. Most of the 19 cases in 4 of the 6 Grant County schools were concentrated in the high school.Grant County counted 5 cases of whooping cough during all of 2016. As of March 23 this year [2017], there were 5 times that number. There are 3800 students in the district.As of [Fri 28 Apr 2017], the state health department had not labeled the increased instances of whooping cough an outbreak. The operative phrase was ""a spike in cases"". Howe said there is information on the school district's website. ""We'd like to see this wrapped up and out of our district and out of our community as soon as possible,"" said Howe.Free vaccines are available for those who meet certain criteria.

This year [2017] 79 cases of whooping cough were confirmed during the month of April in the Northern NSW Local Health District, according to statistics from the NSW Department of Health. In 2016 this number was 77, in 2015 it was 8, just 3 in 2014 and 4 cases in 2013.From the figures the current spike was no surprise to the North Coast Public Health Unit, which anticipated a threat of the infection, acting director of public health, Greg Bell, said: ""Months April-May hold a real threat but last year [2016] cases dropped off as quickly as they rose,"" Mr Bell said.The North Coast Public Health Unit is asking parents to immunize their children against preventable diseases after a spike in cases of the potentially deadly whooping cough disease. Bell said there had been 37 whooping cough notifications on the North Coast in the past week [week of Sun 23 Apr 2017], more than double that in the previous week [week of Sun 16 Apr 2017].Mr Bell said the North Coast experienced a similar spike in whooping cough cases leading into winter last year [2016]. He said persistent low vaccination levels in some parts of Northern NSW was worrying, given that free vaccination is available to all parents. Whooping cough vaccination is valuable in preventing severe infection in infants and toddlers, and if unvaccinated children are infected they are at high risk of severe disease. ""It must be remembered that prior to the NSW Government introducing free antenatal whooping cough vaccinations in 2015, 4 infants had died in the preceding 6 years,"" Mr Bell said. ""All pregnant women are urged to have the free whooping cough vaccine during their 3rd trimester, preferably at 28 weeks, to provide optimal protection to their infants.""Positive health interventions, such as vaccination, in the 1st 5 years of a child's life are vitally important in laying the foundation for a healthy and fulfilling life.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Northern Rivers is one of 14 regions of the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW); it is located in the northern portion of NSW, on the border with the state of Queensland to the north and the Pacific Coast to the east; at its most northern point, Northern Rivers is 102 km (63 mi) south east of Brisbane, the Queensland capital (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers>).
