Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Poliovirus Weekly UpdateAs of: 21-Jun-2017, World Health OrganizationNew wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 6Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37New cVDPV cases reported this week: 15Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 21Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5 Headlines- In Syria, 15 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week [week of 11-17 Jun 2017], bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases in the country to 17. Up to 16 of the 17 cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir-Al-Zour governorate, and one case is from Raqua district, Raqua governorate. All cases had onset of paralysis between [3 Mar 2017 and 23 May 2017]. - The 14th report of the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB ) has been published, following the group's meeting in May [2017]. Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Syria - 15 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were isolated from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, and 4 new cVDPV2 isolated from healthy community contacts. Pakistan - one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) isolated from an environmental sample. See country-specific sections below for more details.Afghanistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 4. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [16 Apr 2017] from Nawzad district, Hilmand province. - With most of Afghanistan polio-free, efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen operations, in close coordination with Pakistan, to address remaining low-level transmission in the common reservoir area of the Quetta-Kandahar corridor.- Afghanistan is carrying out a programme review focusing on the implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan and making necessary adjustments for the second half of 2017.- Polio eradication teams from East and South East Afghanistan and neighbouring FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan met in Kabul on [24-25 May 2017] to review the current coordination mechanisms and agree on additional measures to further improve implementation in the WPV common reservoirs. Core teams from the National Emergency Operation Centres Afghanistan and Pakistan also met to discuss next steps on further improving the vaccination strategies for high risk mobile populations. Pakistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 2. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [13 Feb 2017], from Diamir district, Gilgit Baltistan.- One new WPV1 isolate from an environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on [5 Jun 2017] from Karachi Gadap, Sindh. - The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan.- The National Polio Management Team met on [8-9 Jun 2017] to review implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan during the low transmission season, and to agree on essential adjustments to the plan for the second half of 2017. Nigeria- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week [week of 11-17 Jun 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country.- The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighboring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger.- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa- No new cases were reported in the past week [week of 11-17 Jun 2017]. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is affected by 2 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), in Haut Lomami province (2 cases, with onset of paralysis on [8 Mar 2017 and 20 Feb 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [2 May 2017]). - Outbreak response plans are currently being finalized, with supplementary immunization activities using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.- The 1st mOPV2 campaign is planned for [27-29 Jul 2017], targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 years in the 2 affected provinces. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighboring countries. - DR Congo is also affected by an Ebola outbreak, in Bas Uele province in the north of the country. Coordination among both outbreak response teams will be necessary and teams are already working on this. Syrian Arab Republic- In Syria, 15 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week [week of 11-17 Jun 2017], bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases to 17. Up to 16 of the 17 cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir-Al-Zour governorate, and one case is from Raqua district, Raqua governorate. All cases had onset of paralysis between [3 Mar 2017 and 23 May 2017]. Additionally, 4 cVDPV2s were also isolated from healthy community contacts, all from Mayadeen (collected in [April and May 2017]).- Of a total of 65 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases detected in Deir-Al-Zour since the start of 2017, 16 have now tested positive for cVDPV2 (with the 17th case from Raqua), 22 have tested negative, 5 are pending for final laboratory results and 22 specimens are en route to a laboratory for processing. - Confirmation of these latest cases is not unexpected at this time and does not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Although access to Deir-Al-Zour is compromised due to insecurity, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, 2 campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using the bivalent oral polio vaccine ([bOPV]). However, only limited coverage was possible through these campaigns.

As with previous reports, the above report has good news and not so good news. The good news is encouraging. First there have been no additional cases of WPV1 anywhere in the world, especially in the 3 remaining endemic countries since mid-April 2017. Second, no additional cVDPV cases have been reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The not so good news starts with the ongoing outbreak of cVDPV2 in areas of civil unrest in Syria - Deir al Zour and Raqqa. The number of confirmed cases is now at 17, plus an additional 4 asymptomatic contacts were found to be infected. As mentioned yesterday, the identification of a case in a 2nd province is also of concern. A second cause for concern is the continued isolation of WPV1 in environmental samples in Pakistan, the most recent having been collect during the 1st week of June 2017 in Sindh, confirming that the WPV1 is still circulating in Pakistan. Third, we have learned from an EpiCore surveillance project member that both WPV1 and cVDPV2 have been isolated from environmental samples in Nigeria although I do not have information on dates of most recent isolation of both virus types in Nigeria.So, a current interpretation of the overall situation is that eradication of polio (including WPV1 and cVDPV is near but potentially far as we have seen how the virus(es) can circulate ""silently"" for prolonged periods of time, especially in areas with civil unrest, where the health infrastructure has been virtually dismantled permitting accumulations of ever enlarging pockets of susceptibles that can sustain circulation of the virus (both WPV and cVDPV) when introduced.For those who are interested in reading an update on the status of poliovirus type 2 containment, there is an article in today's MMWR: Previsani N, Singh H, St. Pierre J, et al.
