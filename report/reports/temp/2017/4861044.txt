The Standard [edited]<http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=85301>An eastern Chinese city joined others across the country in banning live poultry sales amid fears over the deadly H7N9 strain of bird flu.The ban is effective for 2 weeks starting today [Wed 22 Feb 2017] in Nanchang, capital of eastern Jiangxi Province. All poultry markets in the city, will be disinfected.The Nanchang Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the public do not need to panic. Jiangxi reported 28 human H7N9 cases, with 7 deaths, from January to mid-February, according to provincial health authorities.Authorities in Kunming, capital of southwestern Yunnan Province, on [Tue 21 Feb 2017] announced that the city will ban the sale and culling of live poultry in downtown areas starting in March [2017]. Earlier this month [February 2017], the H7N9 virus claimed the lives of a 23-year-old woman and her 3-year-old daughter in Kunming.Since January [2017], at least 270 H7N9 human infections have been reported in China, with at least 87 fatalities. Most cases were around the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas. So far, live poultry sales have also been suspended in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Suzhou, several cities in Hunan and Sichuan provinces and the whole of Zhejiang province.The bans have greatly reduced the number of new infections in many regions, said Ni Daxin, deputy director of the emergency response center at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Ni suggested replacing live poultry with frozen birds to reduce the risk of infection. H7N9 was 1st reported in humans in China in March 2013. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Previous studies have shown that live poultry markets (LPMs) are potential locations for virus transmission through human-poultry contact. Yi He et al reported in that the closure of LPMs after epidemiological and laboratory investigations proved timely and effective in the control of human infection with this novel virus, reducing the number of avian influenza A/H7N9 cases. The study concluded that long-term effectiveness of the LPM closures remains to be determined. [<https://wwwnc. cdc.gov/eid/article/20/9/pdfs/13-1243.pdf>]. In the short term, LPM closure should be rapidly implemented in areas where the virus is identified in live poultry or people. However, evidence regarding the effect of such closures on avian influenza virus activity within the market environment is limited and impact of long term closures is largely undetermined.Offeddu et al identified and reviewed a total of 16 publications in this regard in December 2016 [<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771415300112>].They concluded that AIV-circulation can be significantly reduced in the LPM-environment and among market-birds through;(i) temporary LPM closure,(ii) periodic rest days,(iii) market depopulation overnight and,(iv) improved hygiene and disinfection.Overall, the findings indicated that the length of stay of poultry in the market is a critical control point to interrupt the AIV-replication cycle within LPMs. In addition, temporary LPM closure was associated with a significant reduction of the incidence of zoonotic influenza. The interpretation of these findings is limited by variations in the implementation of interventions. In addition, some of the included studies were of ecologic nature or lacked an inferential framework, which might have led to considerable confounding and bias. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/343>.]
