BBC News [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-41070002>About 150 people have been treated in hospital and hundreds more affected by an unknown gas which hit the East Sussex coast.Birling Gap beach was evacuated on [Sun 207 Aug 2017] after people reported breathing difficulties, stinging eyes, and vomiting when a ""mist"" appeared.Sussex Police said on Monday morning [28 Aug 2017] the gas cloud appeared to have cleared.Agencies are investigating the cause and have not ruled out either on-shore or off-shore locations.The advice to keep windows and doors shut in affected areas has now been withdrawn.In the past, chemicals have drifted across from European industrial units, but Sussex Police said: ""Weather models suggest that an onshore source in northern France is very unlikely.""The Coastguard said it was working with its French counterparts and looking into vessels that were in the area at the time.East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it was ""extremely unlikely"" the substance involved was chlorine.Beaches in the area were open as normal on [Mon 28 Aug 2017] and thousands were expected to flock to the coast as temperatures reach up to 25 deg C (75 deg F).Victim JH, 28, who lives close to Birling Gap beach, said people had begun arriving at the beach on [28 Aug 2017] although ""it's maybe a bit less busy than usual."" He said he returned from holiday with his girlfriend at about 16:30 BST on [Sun 27 Aug 2017] and immediately began to suffer.He said: ""We got home, threw open the windows to air the house and quickly developed stingy eyes. At one point I couldn't see for about 5 minutes.""Bob Jefferey, of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Eastbourne Division said: ""Whatever it was, it smelled like burnt plastic. It hung about and didn't move yesterday because there was no wind.""The 1st reports on [Sun 207 Aug 2017] came in from Birling Gap, between Eastbourne and Seaford, just before 17:00 BST where people reported having irritated eyes.The plume of gas moved eastwards along the coast as far as Bexhill, police said.Coastguard rescue teams from Birling Gap, Eastbourne, Bexhill, and Newhaven raced to help clear the busy beaches as visitors feared they had been struck by a chlorine leak.Victim RP, from East Peckham, Kent, was on the beach at the time when what appeared to be a sea mist rolled in from the west.He described it as a colourless, odourless, mist that was ""seriously painful on the eyes.""Victim KC, who was at the Birling Gap beach with his family, said it emptied within 10 minutes after people began to feel unwell. ""It was definitely out of the ordinary considering it was a nice, clear, sunny day 10 minutes beforehand,"" he added. ""It was stupidly busy and it was a boiling hot day. It emptied in about 10 minutes, which was quite staggering considering the amount of people who were there.""Long queues built up at Eastbourne General District Hospital well into the evening, with approximately 150 people being treated, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said. ""Initially, patients were dealt with as a precaution with a full decontamination treatment, but it became clear that this was not necessary, following clinical advice,"" a spokesman said.Members of the public alerted emergency services, which triggered callouts to the UK Coastguard, Sussex Police, South Eastern Ambulance Service, and East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, who said they were treating it as a ""chemical incident.""[...]Police said it was believed that this was an ""isolated incident and is not expected to recur.""Eastbourne councillor Kathy Ballard said: ""We need to find out the cause, where did this come from, and to make sure that steps are taken so that it does not happen again. ""I have not heard of it happening before in this area.""--Communicated by:Sabine ZentisCastleview English LonghornsGut LaachD-52385 NideggenGermany<http://www.cvlonghorns.de><cvlonghorns@aol.com>andProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 30 Aug 2017 9:41 AM BSTSource: The Sun [edited]<https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4351510/beachy-head-chemical-leak-space-east-sussex-birling-gap/>Experts studied satellite images yesterday [29 Aug 2017] in a bid to solve the mystery over the ""chemical mist"" that engulfed Beachy Head over the Bank Holiday [28 Aug 2017] weekend.One picture appeared to show a plume more than 2 miles [3.2 km] long approaching the Birling Gap after coming off a boat.Previously experts said the bizarre gas cloud, which left 150 people in hospital with stinging eyes and noses, breathing difficulties, and being sick, may have been caused by a ""toxic algal bloom.""But boffins from the Plymouth Marine Lab tweeted yesterday [29 Aug 2017] that the images showed there was ""no algal unusual activity to suggest harmful bloom caused Birling Gap haze.""Holidaymakers and locals were hit as they enjoyed the Bank Holiday weekend sunshine on [Sun 27 Aug 2017].It was quickly ruled out that it came from the UK mainland due to onshore winds.It was then feared it had come from chemical industries in Dieppe or Le Havre, northern France -- but this was also discounted due to weather patterns.Henry Prout of Newhaven RNLI [Royal National Lifeboat Institution] said: ""The gas could have come from a container dropped at sea many, many years ago whose seal has finally broken.""Or it could have come from a vessel doing a chemical clean, which is prohibited in maritime law.""Whatever the cause it is going to be extremely difficult to identify the source.""[...]In January 2013 a foul-smelling gas cloud prompted thousands of calls to the emergency services in Sussex, Kent, Surrey and Hampshire after drifting across the English Channel. The accidental discharge of mercaptan came from a factory in Rouen, France.In 2008, there was also a panic when agricultural waste blew over from France.[Byline: Liam Kelly]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The 2nd article above has some good photos of some of the things discussed. There is clearly no evidence of a toxic bloom, but there is a mysterious white cloud emanating from a central point. I could understand how it could be a ship, but a container at the bottom of the ocean? I cannot rule it out but it seems much more unlikely.Burning eyes and nose could be chlorine, but that often comes with difficulty breathing and possibly burning of the skin. While the hospital notes originally it was decontaminating people, it became clear this was not necessary. It appears these people were treated and released. Perhaps a little oxygen and some eye wash? We have scant details to speculate on the type of gas or mist seeming to affect these individuals.The source may or may not be found but I would bet they will be checking the point of the cloud believed to be a ship.If this beach had only young people on it one might think it was a psychosomatic situation but this was a beach full of families and people of all ages. Good to know all those affected seem to have recovered. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63071>.].................................................tg/mj/dk"
