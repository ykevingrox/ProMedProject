Do we know what strain(s) of meningococcal disease the Taiwan cases had? Were they all the same? If the organisms are distinguishable, we would not consider this an outbreak but, rather, a cluster.2. Much of the evidence on which chemoprophylaxis policies are based is now rather old. At the time, it was far more common for students to live in ""dormitories"", with 2 or more students sharing a bedroom. Now -- at least in the UK -- this is extremely unusual: most student accommodation has only one student (or couple) per bedroom - no sharing with a relative stranger. A high proportion even have en-suite bathroom facilities. Is that the same in USA? Perhaps the Taiwanese military provides less comfortable lodgings!3. What is the basis for the moderator's comment that ""The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage."" I'm particularly interested in the comment that the ""serogroup B vaccine will only cover..."". Since the so-called serogroup B vaccines do not use the polysaccharide capsule ABCWY antigens, but rather antigens from different part of the organism, they are independent of the ABCWY antigens, and the group B vaccines can be expected to be effective against meningococci independent of the ABCWY classification.4. Experience with these new so-called serogroup B vaccines remains limited. At present we do not have evidence to clarify the extent of ""herd immunity"" they will provide, but we have some evidence to suggest that they prevent disease (invasion), but not colonization (infection), and are therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on herd immunity.5. The rationale for chemoprophylaxis based on the hypothesis that a more-than-usually virulent strain has evolved, with the argument going as follows:a. Meningococcal carriage is common - in some studies, over a 3rd of 1rst-year university students will be carrying the organism after 2-3 months at university (a combination of the carriage rates in this age-group, and the social-mixing effect of starting at university, presumably).b. People [who] become ill with invasive meningococcal disease almost invariably get sick within 5 days of acquiring the organism. If somebody has been colonized for 7 days or more, they are extremely unlikely to get sick with it.c. Some strains -- like the C strain that caused outbreaks in teenagers in the UK in the 90s -- are considerably more virulent, with very little asymptomatic carriage. (The virulence genes are unrelated to the capsular phenotype, and capsular switching, maintaining the same virulence factors, is possible and appears to have happened with the increase in W serogroup disease in the UK, for example.[1])d. For the less virulent strains at least...e. When somebody becomes ill, it could be because of individual factors (the case was unusually susceptible -- for underlying reasons, such as inherited complement deficiencies, or because of an unfortunate timing eg recent viral infection); or because of pathogen associated factors -- the organism had evolved to become more than usually virulent.f. Given the high carriage rates, there's little point in chemoprophylaxis for normally virulent organisms.g. So chemoprophylaxis is based on the hypothesis that the case may have acquired their infection from a healthy carrier of a more virulent organism. The purpose is to eliminate carriage of this organism. The contacts targeted are therefore those from whom the case is most likely to have acquired their infection. (There is very little evidence of benefit for treating other people exposed to the case.)h. There is also a hypothesis -- supported, I believe, by some evidence -- that healthy carriers of meningococci and related organisms (such as _N. lactamica_) can benefit from ""competitive inhibition"". This means that the presence of the organism they are carrying reduces their chances of acquiring a new, potentially more virulent strain - see b. above.i. For this reason, extending chemoprophylaxis to people other than those from whom the case acquired their infection might do more harm than good (by increasing people's susceptibility to new infections).1.

Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing of _Neisseria meningitidis_. Studies that tested in an in vitro bactericidal assay against serogroup C, W and Y meningococci using sera collected in the UK, Germany, France and Brazil from individuals immunized with one of the B serogroup vaccines found that sera from was bactericidal ""in a range from 45 per cent to 90 per cent"" (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755123/#R11>), the preliminary data having been presented in poster sessions.However, on the basis of what we know for sure at present, ""experts from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"" (<http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_meningococcal_b.asp>), say that meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines ""provide no protection against serogroup B disease, and meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (MenB) provide no protection against serogroup A, C, W, or Y disease. For protection against all 5 serogroups of meningococcus, it is necessary to receive MenACWY or MPSV4 and MenB."" And the CDC's recommendations (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mening-serogroup.html>) clearly state, ""Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. Other meningococcal vaccines are recommended to help protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.""In regard to antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, its rationale for close contacts of cases of meningococcal disease is based on the high attack rate of secondary meningococcal disease among these contacts, which has been estimated to be 500-800 times greater than for the general population (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046263.htm>). Because the attack rate for close contacts is highest during the 1st few days after onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible. - Mod.ML][See Also:Meningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan: fatal, military base 20170801.5218924].................................................ml/ec/sh"
