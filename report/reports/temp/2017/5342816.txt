In a reader survey several years ago, respondents mentioned as advantages of the site that it had an easy navigation structure, focused on content, and that it was robust with good response times. Respondents also flagged that while they were, overall, happy with Eurosurveillance and its content, they missed some important features that several other journals offered.We have been developing a new website that, while preserving the advantages of the old site, will respond better to our readers' needs and interests. This week will be the last time that we will send the Table of Contents (TOC) containing links to articles published on the old website, and we are glad to announce the imminent launch of a new website in the afternoon of [Mon 25 Sep 2017].The ""new"" Eurosurveillance will offer social bookmarking, a more refined search, article-level metrics, a citation export feature, and the opportunity to download PowerPoints for figures and tables for all users. In addition, everyone who registers via the new website will be able to set up and save content searches and specific alerts, including citation alerts and saved search alerts, so that authors can be automatically notified when their work is cited or users receive an alert when a paper covering a topic of particular interest to them is published. These are but a few of the new, useful features.The new website will remain both open access and free of article processing charges.****It is important to note that in order to follow European Union data protection rules, current subscribers to the weekly TOC will automatically be unsubscribed from Eurosurveillance and all collected personal data will be destroyed. Everyone who wishes to benefit from the new features and to receive the weekly TOC is invited to say hello to the new website and visit it at <http://www.eurosurveillance.org> to register and subscribe once it is launched****We look forward to receiving your feedback <eurosurveillance@ecdc.europa.eu> and hope our readers and authors will like the new Eurosurveillance.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We are posting this announcement as a reminder to those who have subscribed to Eurosurveillance in the past (and for those who haven't but should subscribe to this excellent weekly report) to renew subscriptions now that the new website has been launched.We wish good luck to our colleagues at Eurosurveillance. - Mod.MPP].................................................mpp/msp/ml"
