Khmer Times [edited]<http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/35382/hand--foot--mouth-disease-alert/>The Health Ministry's Communicable Disease Control (CDC) department has urged people to be cautious of the spread of hand, food and mouth disease (HFMD) and asked that infants or children displaying symptoms be brought to seek medical treatment immediately.Ministry spokesperson and director of the CDC Ly Sovann said yesterday [12 Feb 2017] that hospitals have been seeing a rise in HFMD cases and appealed to all parents to be vigilant in identifying the symptoms so that children can be given treatment immediately.""Especially for children with dangerous symptoms, they have to be sent to the Children's Specialized Hospital immediately. Dangerous symptoms include vomiting as well as arm and foot convulsions or weakness,"" he said.Mr. Sovann also recommended that people regularly wash their hands with either soap or an alcohol-based solution such as hand sanitizer, especially after touching blisters or ulcers, before preparing or eating food, before feeding infants or children, after using the toilet and after changing a baby's diaper.He also asked that parents keep their children away from sick or symptomatic children, to provide nutritious meals for their children, to provide clean drinking water and to use separate utensils when feeding each child.According to the CDC, HFMD is an infectious disease which commonly affects infants and children under the age of 10. Symptoms include fever, painful mouth ulcers as well as blisters and a rash on the palms and soles of the feet.""While HFMD is a mild ailment, with most patients being able to recover within 7-10 days without treatment, there are also rare cases where the disease can develop serious complications affecting the nerve and respiratory systems.""The child then needs to be sent to the nearest hospital immediately,"" Mr. Sovann said.The virus is spread by direct contact with respiratory fluids such as saliva, sputum, mucus, fluid from blisters and the stool of patients.In 2012, dozens of children were infected with a deadly strain of HFMD which killed 52, Time magazine quoted the World Health Organization and the Health Ministry as saying.The epidemic that spread in April 2012 landed 62 children in hospital as medical practitioners struggled to identify the EV-71 strain, previously unrecognized in Cambodia.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Viet NamDate: Thu 16 Feb 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/vietnam-issues-hand-foot-mouth-disease-warning-76944/>After reporting about 50 000 hand, foot and mouth disease cases in 2016, Vietnamese health officials with the General Department of Preventive Medicine are warning the public to take protective measures as more than 2100 cases have been seen in 57 localities so far in 2017.A local media report does note that the total number of cases is still 38.6 percent lower than in the same period last year [2016], with most cases reported in south.HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7-10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.Enterovirus 71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over several years. EV-71 is a non-polio enterovirus. Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of Cambodia and Viet Nam can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/145>.]******[3] UK (Essex)Date: Fri 17 Feb 2017Source: Essex Live [edited]<http://www.essexlive.news/hand-foot-and-mouth-in-essex-what-to-expect/story-30144000-detail/story.html>Parents are on alert over an outbreak of the highly contagious hand, foot and mouth disease. Cases have been reported across Essex, with parents in Brentwood this week announcing appearances of the virus.The infectious disease causes mouth ulcers and spots on the hands and feet and is most common in young children, particularly those under 10. It can, however, also affect older children and adults.The symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease usually develop between 3-5 days after being exposed to the infection.The 1st symptoms may include a high temperature, usually around 38-39 C [100-102 F], a general sense of feeling unwell, loss of appetite, coughing, abdominal pain and a sore throat and mouth.The infection is not related to foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs.The disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7-10 days. Doctors say children can be normally looked after at home.[Byline: Piers Meyler]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the UK (Essex) can be found at <http://www.propertysurveying.co.uk/ESSEX/images/essex-map.jpg>.]******[4] USA (California)Date: Wed 14 Feb 2017Source: KESQ-TV [edited]<http://www.kesq.com/news/hfm-disease-hits-local-elementary-school/334018574>There were recently 4 confirmed cases of hand, foot and mouth disease at an elementary school [Palm Springs Unified School District] in Desert Hot Springs.Parents with children in kindergarten and 1st grade were sent a letter warning them about possible exposure to the disease.One doctor said that while it sounds terrible, the name is scarier than the illness.""The virus is called Coxsackie. It's within the same family [as] chicken pox [see comment below]. It's not necessarily, though, as significant of a disease,"" pediatrician Ernesto Millan said.Millan said the disease causes painful blisters on the inside of the mouth, hands and feet.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it can be spread through saliva, blister fluid and feces. That is why doctors recommend people wash their hands often.""If you live with the person, there's not much you can do other than [wash your hands], you know, just keeping it from spreading to someone else and of course, like you tell all the kids, cover your cough,"" Millan said.Millan said it's usually seen in children under 6 and lasts about 10 days. It's a virus, and doctors can only treat the symptoms, such as fever, rash, and blisters.""We offer Tylenol for significant fever of 102 F [39 C] and higher. We provide and encourage oral and liquid intakes to make sure they are not getting dehydrated,"" Dr. Millan said.Millan said a child is no longer contagious even if a rash remains once symptoms like fever and pain from the blisters are relieved.He says students can return to school after those symptoms have cleared-up.Prevention Tips:- Wash any clothing and bed linens used by someone carrying the virus.- Avoid using shared items in the home.- Wash hands regularly and frequently to prevent the spread of the virus.- Throw away all toothbrushes used in the home by family members and replace with new ones.More information can be found on the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention's website.[Byline: Zarina Khairzada]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap showing the location of California in the USA can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]******[5] RFI: Dominican Republic (La Altagracia)Date: Fri 17 Feb 2017Source: Online Submission/Direct Communication [edited][The following information was received from a ProMED-mail subscriber who wishes to remain anonymous.]At least one child was reportedly infected with hand, foot, and mouth (HFM) disease while vacationing in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Subsequently, 2 additional family members also developed HFM lesions on their return to Canada. There are reportedly no other outbreaks in the travelers' local area.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Hand, foot, and mouth disease is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which affects cattle, sheep, and swine. However, the 2 diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Humans can contract the animal disease (FMDV) although this is rare, and animals do not typically get the human disease under normal circumstances.Large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease are not common in the United States. However, in some countries in Asia, outbreaks are large and occur often. Thousands of people may get infected. Some people, particularly young children, may have severe disease requiring hospitalization or even causing death. Travelers to these countries can protect themselves by practicing personal hygiene tips (CDC). - Mod.LK][Any additional information on these cases or other cases in the Dominican Republic would be appreciated, as HFM may not be known to many international travelers despite its frequent occurrence in daycare facilities in North America. It's unknown if the travelers were infected via exposure to other infected travelers, or the local populace, or if others were also exposed at the same time.In reference to item 4 (HFMD in California) the statement that Coxsackie ""is within the same family [as] chickenpox"" is incorrect. Coxsackie viruses are in the Picornaviridae family while chickenpox (Varicella zoster) is part of the herpesviridae family. - Mod.JH]A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/145>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32276>.]
