She had lived and worked in the park for 10 years.Her daughter, who is a registered nurse, said the cause of death is listed as respiratory failure, but she feels it was brought on by the tick-borne virus. She died on 23 Jun [2017] after spending 24 days in Barnes Hospital, St. Louis.Despite testing positive for the virus twice at Barnes [hospital], the family is still awaiting official confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that the Bourbon virus lead to her death.""We haven't heard anything from anybody,"" the daughter said. ""When she went into the hospital on 31 May [2017], she didn't have any lung problems. Then she died because she couldn't breathe."" She added that her mother was active and didn't have any other health problems before being bitten by a tick around Memorial Day weekend.""This came out of nowhere,"" she said. ""I was at her house on Mother's Day; 2 weeks later, she was in the hospital, and we were wondering if we were going to lose our mom.""The daughter said 2 seed ticks were removed from her mother's hip shortly after the Memorial Day weekend. Shortly after, the mother became ill and visited her primary care doctor in Sullivan, who diagnosed her with a urinary tract infection and prescribed antibiotics.""Two or 3 days later, she wasn't feeling any better,"" the daughter said. ""They ran her blood and found her platelets and white blood cell count was low and sent her straight to Barnes [hospital] on 31 May [2017],"" where she was immediately admitted and told the doctors she had been bitten by a tick.""The infectious disease doctors told us they were going to run everything,"" the daughter said. ""She developed a light rash, mostly on her extremities at 1st, then it got much worse."" The doctors at 1st thought her mother had Rocky Mountain spotted fever or Heartland virus, and they were going to send some of her blood to the CDC for further testing.[On ""11 Jun [2017], the results came back, and she tested positive for Bourbon virus,"" the daughter said. ""They told us they didn't know much about the virus and were learning off the internet just like we were. They told us it basically attacks your organs.""Soon after, the patient began to have complications with her bone marrow, liver, lungs, and the rash became so bad she couldn't talk, eat or even swallow. She had abnormal enzymes and was diagnosed with pneumonia, and, just before she died, doctors began treating her for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threatening immunodeficiency related to white blood cell irregularities.A 2nd test for Bourbon virus came back positive [on] 22 Jun [2017], just hours before she died.On Mon 26 Jun 2017, staff from the CDC and county health department began a systematic effort to trap and collect ticks at Meramec State Park. Following the collection process, the agencies began testing the ticks for any kind of tick-borne illness [pathogen].The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) is expected to release the tick testing results when they are received from the CDC.Meramec State Park and all of its facilities remain open for regular operations.This is only the 5th confirmed case of Bourbon virus [infection] since it was 1st discovered in 2014.[Byline: Monte Miller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report provides additional details for this case that was originally published on 30 Jun 2017 (see Bourbon virus - USA: (MO) tick-borne case 20170703.5147985). Mod.LK provided an informative comment and reference citation in that post: ""Bourbon virus is a member of the _Thogotovirus_ genus of enveloped RNA viruses, one of 7 genera in the virus family _Orthomyxoviridae_. Their single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome has 6 or 7 segments. Several related viruses have been identified in hard tick species; while it is unknown how Bourbon virus is transmitted, it is also assumed to be tick-borne because of seasonality of the disease and association with tick bites.As of 27 Jun 2017, a limited number of Bourbon virus disease cases have been identified in the Midwest and southern United States. Some people who have been infected later died. At this time, it is not known whether the virus might be found in other areas of the United States.There is no information provided on the status of this newest patient and what [her] symptoms were [these now are presented above]. In general, the symptoms have been non-specific, including fever, tiredness, rash, headache, other body aches, nausea, and vomiting. They also had low blood counts for cells that fight infection and help prevent bleeding. Bourbon virus should be included in the differential diagnoses when a patient presents with history of a tick bite and fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, and who does not respond to antibiotics.Reference: Kosoy OI, Lambert AJ, Pastula DM et al.
