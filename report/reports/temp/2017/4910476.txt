According to EWARN [Early Warning and Response Network], there have been 121 cases in the past 2 months, compared to 50 cases in the past 2 years.Several areas throughout Syria remain under heavy siege.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The situation in Syria is heartbreaking. The world community must take a stand to put an end to such willful destruction of life.

In addition, most other Australian states have reported cases in Bali travellers in the past fortnight.Bali is a popular travel destination for Western Australians because of proximity, and it is a frequent source of imported measles cases -- with over 20 separate importations since 2013. However, the number of cases reported in WA and other Australian states ,at present indicates that measles transmission must currently be high in Bali.Clinicians in other countries should consider the diagnosis in travellers from Bali with fever/rash illnesses, along with other diseases common there, including dengue fever. It would also be prudent to recommend MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine to persons planning to travel to Bali, if there is doubt as to whether they have had 2 prior doses of measles vaccine.Dr Gary DowseMedical EpidemiologistCommunicable Disease ControlDirectorate Public Health DivisionDepartment of Health (Western Australia)<Gary.Dowse@health.wa.gov.au>[ProMED thanks Dr Dowse for submitting this warning. We recently reported on imported measles cases in Australian travelers returning to New South Wales from Bali (see ProMED-mail Measles update (12) 20170314.4900920).

That child also had not been vaccinated against MMR before leaving for China last October [2016], according to the agency.The CDC suggested that infants aged under 1 year and unvaccinated against MMR should not be taken to areas affected by measles.Measles is rampant in several countries in the region, including China, Indonesia, and Thailand, as well as in the African country of Guinea.The CDC has issued a level 1 (watch) travel notice for measles for 10 countries -- China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Kazakhstan, Romania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.The CDC's 3-tier travel advisory system is watch, alert, and warning, in order of severity.On [Wed 15 Mar 2017], CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said that vaccination is the best way to prevent measles infection.Lo described the disease as highly contagious, noting that 5 percent to 10 percent of those infected will suffer from complications, such as tympanitis, pneumonia, and encephalitis.[Byline: Chen Wei-ting, Elizabeth Hsu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Taiwan can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>. - Mod.LK]******[4] South Africa (Johannesburg): alertDate: Thu 16 Mar 2017Source: YOU.co.za, News24 Wire report [edited]<http://www.you.co.za/supermom/measles-in-johannesburg-make-sure-your-child-is-vaccinated/>The City of Johannesburg on [Wed 15 Mar 2017] urged parents and caregivers to ensure that their children are vaccinated after a high alert for measles was issued.""Parents and community members can help [avoid an outbreak of measles] by ensuring that all children are immunised against measles at the correct ages,"" mayoral committee member for health Mpho Phalatse said in a statement.""Any child who is suspected to be suffering from measles should be taken to the nearest health facility for examination and investigation.""The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) issued a health alert in late January [2017] following a measles outbreak in Stellenbosch, Western Cape.The City of Johannesburg said 9 cases of measles have been reported in the city thus far.Those at the highest risk of contracting measles are unvaccinated young children and pregnant women, the city said.Phalatse said according to the World Health Organisation measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children, even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available.""During 2000-2015, measles vaccination prevented 20.3 million deaths worldwide,"" Phalatse said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The NICD says a total of 37 cases of measles have been reported since the beginning of the year (2017).It's understood the organisation is working with the Health Department to ensure the outbreak remains under control.From <http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/17/nicd-warns-measles-in-sa-is-extremely-dangerous>Maps of South Africa can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/south_africa_prov_map2.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2321>. - Mod LK]*****[5] ItalyDate: Thu 16 Mar 2017 18:38 CETSource: ANSA [edited]<http://www.ansa.it/english/news/science_tecnology/2017/03/16/230-measles-rise_a4af5cb0-04c7-4dc7-ac36-0290ec62fb33.html>The health ministry said [Thu 16 Mar 2017] that there has been a worrying increase in the number of measles cases registered so far this year. It said there have been 700 cases since the start of the year, a rise of 230 percent on the 200 registered in the same period last year [2016].There were 844 cases in the whole of 2016. The ministry said the majority of cases were reported on Piedmont, Lazio, Lombardy, Tuscany. Most of them involved people aged between 15 and 39. Ex-premier Matteo Renzi said the data showed that doubts about vaccines, which have contributed to a reduction in coverage rates in Italy in recent years, must be dismissed. ""Have you seen the health ministry data on measures? Crazy!""Renzi, who is standing to be re-elected leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) next month [April 2017], said on his Facebook page. ""A 230 percent increase registered in the 1st few months of 2017. I say this as a parent first and then a politician: you don't joke about vaccines. No more controversy, let's take science seriously. And let's put the health of our children at the centre, not propaganda.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[According to ministry data, only 85.3 percent of Italian 2-year-olds had been vaccinated in 2015, well short of the 95 percent threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to contain outbreaks.Although it usually only triggers relatively mild symptoms, measles can cause fatal complications. In Italy's last major epidemic there were 18 000 registered cases and 15 deaths.Italy was one of the countries where discredited claims of a link between the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination and autism had a significant impact on public perceptions of the safety of the jab.That was partly because a local court in Rimini awarded damages to the family of a young boy with autism in 2012 on the grounds that his condition had most likely been caused by the MMR vaccination. The ruling was overturned on appeal 3 years later.The notion of an MMR-autism link was first suggested by a British researcher, Andrew Wakefield, in a 1998 paper for medical journal the Lancet that was subsequently found to have been falsified.The paper was withdrawn in 2010 and Wakefield was barred from practising medicine. Numerous major studies since have found no evidence of a link.Excerpted from Medical Press <https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-03-measles-cases-triple-italy-parents.html>.Maps of Italy can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_admin_06.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>. - Mod.LK]
