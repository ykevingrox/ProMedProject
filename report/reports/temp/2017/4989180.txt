""New cases have continued to be reported in new locations across the country during the dry season,"" OCHA said in its latest report released in Juba.According to the UN, there are concerns that the outbreak will intensify and spread during the upcoming rainy season due to continued conflict, displacement and inadequate access to clean water and sanitation.The UN said response is underway in Jonglei Health and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) teams are responding to new and suspected cholera cases in Duk, Ayod and Fangak in Jonglei, amid the longest running outbreak since South Sudan became an independent nation in July 2011.Health experts say some cases of the cholera across the country remain unconfirmed due to a critical lack of the laboratory equipment needed to obtain a diagnosis, which humanitarian organizations are working to address.[Byline: editor, Mu Xuequan]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Diarrhea - Myanmar (Rakhine State)Date: Sat 22 Apr 2017, 7:26 PMSource: Eleven Myanmar [edited]<http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/local/8967>Children in 10 villages in Ann Township in Rakhine State are reportedly being affected by diarrhea and given treatment.

As reported in Africa (currently in the Horn of Africa) periods of flooding and drought increase the risk of outbreaks. As demonstrated in Haiti the introduction of cholera into a country with a destroyed sanitary system and no underlying immunity can cause a major epidemic. In the classical endemic areas such as the Indian subcontinent and other areas in Asia, rainy reasons often accentuate the number of cases. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6638>.]
