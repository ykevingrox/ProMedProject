The report said that 15 residents ate meat from carabao that had died due to anthrax.<http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/603787/news/regions/15-abra-residents-rushed-to-hospital-after-eating-meat-from-sick-carabao>Health authorities in the province of Abra in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) of northern Luzon were alerting the public to be aware of a potential outbreak of anthrax, which officials had already linked to the consumption of carabao meat in January 2013<https://news.abrenian.com/2013/01/25/carabao-meat-linked-to-possible-anthrax-outbreak-in-lagangilang/>Carabao is the national animal of the Philippines.Anthrax is a zoonotic disease transmitted from the infected animals by direct contact, inhalation and ingestion.ProMED-MBDS would highly appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources on the cause of the human anthrax in Philippines.Maps of the Philippines can be seen at<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Labelled_map_of_the_Philippines_-_Provinces_and_Regions.png>and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/38718>. - Mod.TTMFifty three anthrax cases from just one bovine are exceptional. At most it is usually only half that number, and as a rule of thumb I expect around 10 cases per carcass, though many more may be taken in for observation and prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Like my fellow moderator I would appreciate any clarifying information and especially if other animals were involved. Our previous report [Fri 17 Mar 2017 Anthrax - Philippines: (AB) human, bovine, susp 20170317.4908090] involved a single dead carabao/buffalo. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42724>.]
