Bangla [in Bengali, trans. Tridip Das, edited]<http://bangla.jagoroniya.com/health/8467/>Mosquito-borne chikungunya is spreading [in Dhaka, the capital city in Bangladesh]. The disease is transmitted by biting _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. Many people in the capital city [Dhaka] have been known to be affected with the disease in this summer [2017].The doctors say that chikungunya is a viral disease. It is not life-threatening, but many physical discomforts may be seen in people affected with the disease. The former director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), Dr Mahmudur Rahman, said that headache, catarrh, nausea, and joint pain may be seen in patients suffering from chikungunya virus infection. The virus comes to people from the mosquitoes, and mosquitoes can also get the infection while biting chikungunya-affected people and can again transmit the virus to people. The disease is transmitted only by female mosquitoes.Clinical symptoms of the disease usually appear after 5 days from the introduction of the virus into the body through biting of a mosquito, Dr. Rahman added, and he also said that there was news of a chikunguniya epidemic in India in 2005 affecting 1.4 million people.The disease was 1st reported in Bangladesh in the districts of Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj in 2008. He said there is no treatment for the disease. Supportive treatments for fever and headache can cure a patient suffering from the disease. However, mosquito bites should be prevented.He said high body temperatures of about 104-105 F [40 C] have recently being noticed in patients suffering from the disease. Use of paracetamol and body sponging can be effective. The fever should not continue for more than 4 or 5 days. If it persists for longer, medical advice should be taken.Other doctors opined that there is no treatment of the disease like for other viral diseases. Ample water, juice, oral saline, and coconut water should be taken. To alleviate fever, paracetamol is recommended. There is no vaccine for chikungunya.The doctors said that _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the vector of the disease. These mosquitoes bite during daytime, especially in the afternoon. Mosquito nets should be used while sleeping during the day, and mosquito breeding-places should be destroyed. The cleaning of water pots and containers kept open for longer periods of time should be ensured.--Communicated by:Tridip DasMS fellow in microbiology, CVASU<das.vet671@gmail.com>[ProMED thanks Mr Tridip Das for sharing this report.The 1st identified chikungunya outbreak occurred in Bangladesh in 2008. In October 2011, a major outbreak was reported from Dhaka district, which was later confirmed to be chikungunya (<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003907>). This indicates that both the virus and the vector are prevalent in the country, resulting in outbreaks in various geographical areas.Efforts to improve surveillance and identify outbreaks more quickly could provide an opportunity for public health actions, such as mosquito control, to reduce transmission. WHO guidelines suggest that environmental interventions, such as destroying natural and human-made mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, may be more cost-effective than chemical methods to kill larvae and adult mosquitoes [WHO Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Chikungunya Fever. 2009].Furthermore, ecological studies to better describe the spatial and temporal distribution of vector habitats could help explain why outbreaks in Bangladesh remain geographically limited and could be used to target interventions in populations at the highest risk for vector-borne diseases. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153>.]
