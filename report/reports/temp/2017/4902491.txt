This affects over 500 people because there are 3 buildings and it takes more than 24 hours to eliminate (the emergency situation). Based on these criteria, an emergency situation has been declared,"" he said.According to the official, the commission has activated an emergency operations centre to handle the emergency.The National Public Health Service said that samples from 2 apartment blocks in the Zirmunai neighborhood, at Tuskulenu 5, and Ladygos 3, had tested positive for the bacteria that cause legionnaires' disease and samples from an apartment block in the Lazdynai neighborhood were still being tested.To date, 2 residents of these buildings have died of legionnaires' disease and a 3rd is being treated.[Byline: Donata Motuzaite]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his continued contributions.Genotyping clinical and environmental _Legionella_ isolates will help establish transmission pathways: a common source would be presumed for cases that have matching of _Legionella_ genotypes; and a source for these cases with matching genotypes would be confirmed if the clinical genotype matches an environmental genotype.Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania and its largest city, with a population of 542 664 residents as of 2015 (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius>). Zirmunai, where 2 apartment blocks tested positive for _Legionella_, is Vilnius's most populous administrative division, located north of central Vilnius (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ irmÇnai>).
