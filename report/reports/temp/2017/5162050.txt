The Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/20-encephalitis-deaths-in-dibrugarh-this-year/articleshow/59499791.cms>The death toll from encephalitis in Dibrugarh district has touched 20 this year [2017] even as health authorities are trying their best to combat the deadly vector-borne disease. Six people died of Japanese encephalitis (JE) while 14 succumbed to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).Another 140 persons from the district have tested positive for JE and AES and are undergoing treatment at Assam Medical College and Hospital. Most of the cases were recently reported from the rural pockets of the district. ""Twenty encephalitis deaths have occurred since 1 Jan this year [2017] and 140 have tested positive out of which 27 are JE-affected and 113 have AES. They are at various stages of recovery,"" said Udayan Kumar Baruah, joint director of health services (Dibrugarh) on [Fri 7 Jul 2017].In view of the grim situation, the health department has already sounded an alert across the district. Rapid response teams comprising of doctors, nurses, ASHA workers and para-medical staff have been formed in the state dispensaries, primary health centres, community health centres, 1st referral units and district hospitals to deal with the situation. The joint director added that long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN) were being distributed among people in those pockets found to be highly susceptible to the vector-borne disease. Fogging was also being carried out in several areas of the district.The outbreak of JE in the state usually coincides with the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons which are conducive for mosquitoes to breed. The 3 months from June to August are usually the peak period for the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Assam state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus and cases occur there every year. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in north eastern India, not all cases are due to JE virus and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in north eastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus ( _Orientia tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.Although avoidance of mosquito bites is prudent, vector control is difficult so vaccination is the best protective measure. No mention of vaccination campaigns is made in the above report. The virus has birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. - Mod.TYMaps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of India can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306>The HealthMap/Promed map of Assam State, India can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299>.]
