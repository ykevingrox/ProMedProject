""One hundred percent of vaccinated people have a high antibody titer to the causative agent. We have been monitoring the vaccinated individuals for 5 months now, and this titer has remained high for 5 months. The blood serum of those vaccinated completely kills and neutralizes the virus in laboratory conditions,"" the minister explained.][This vaccine is a live attenuated heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine.
