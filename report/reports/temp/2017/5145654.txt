Medical Express [edited]<https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-06-measles-outbreak-romania.html>A measles outbreak affecting several European countries has killed 30 people in Romania, most of them children, health authorities in Bucharest said on Friday [23 Jun 2017].More than 7200 people in the European Union's 2nd-poorest country have contracted the illness since late 2016, Romania's contagious disease monitoring centre said.There was also a 31st suspected fatality.The respiratory disease, characterised by high fever and small red spots, usually triggers only mild symptoms, but it remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally.The World Health Organization recommends 2 doses of vaccination, the 1st by a child's 1st birthday, to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, saying they should cover 95 percent of the population.But in Romania, due not only to poverty but also a lack of vaccines and poor access to health care, the rate is only 80 percent for the 1st shot and 50 percent for the 2nd.The Romanian government is currently pushing through legislation that would make vaccination obligatory in order for children to be allowed to go to school.Compounding the problem, a growing number of parents are refusing to have their children immunised, with religious groups and public figures also launching anti-vaccination campaigns.The WHO warned in March 2017 about a rising number of measles cases in Europe, with the largest outbreaks in Romania and Italy. France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland and Ukraine were also affected.On Thu [29 Jun 2017], a 6-year-old boy with leukaemia died from measles in Italy. He had an 85-percent chance of being cured of his leukaemia, but his parents refused to have him vaccinated for measles, Italian authorities said.They said that at least 3074 measles cases have been recorded this year [2017], 40 percent of whom had to be hospitalised. The WHO said on Tue [27 Jun 2017] that 43 percent of cases in Europe were in Italy.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
