Press-Enterprise [edited]<http://www.pe.com/2017/08/10/mosquito-known-to-carry-zika-yellow-fever-found-in-western-riverside-county/>A mosquito capable of carrying disease-causing [viruses] was found on 28 Jul [2017] in western Riverside County, the Northwest Mosquito and Vector Control District announced on Thursday [10 Aug 2017].Many mosquitoes feed during the dusk or dawn hours, but the _Aedes aegypti_, most commonly known as the yellow fever mosquito, is a daylight-hour insect capable of transmitting several viruses, including Zika, yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya, according to a news release.Officials said there haven't been any reports of illness due to this type of mosquito, but the vector control district will be conducting ""intensive surveillance"" in areas surrounding the place they discovered this insect, including door-to-door inspections for mosquitoes and sources of standing water where they can breed.Officials ""will take appropriate measures to eliminate mosquitoes and mosquito larval sources.""[Byline: Doug Saunders]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were found in Riverside county last year (2016) and in several locations in the county in 2015, this is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in the county this year [2017]. As noted earlier, finding _Aedes aegypti_ in this county is not surprising. Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 13 years (see archives listed below). Both of them have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1-3 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya or dengue virus transmission.Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of these viruses into southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4364>.
