FIC [edited]<http://www.flu.org.cn/en/news_detail?action=ql&uid=MjI0OA&pd=YXRsbXBw&newsId=19617>The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health of HongKong is [8 Sep 2017] monitoring a notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission that an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) was recorded from [1 to 7 Sep 2017] in Hunan, and strongly urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.The 67-year-old male patient in Zhangjiajie had onset on [27 Aug 2017] and was admitted to hospital for severe pneumonia. He had exposure to a live poultry market before onset.Travelers to the mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] H7N9 wavesDate: Fri 8 Sep 2017, 12:08 AMSource: WFAE 90.7 [edited]<http://wfae.org/post/deadly-bird-flu-china-evolves-spreads-new-regions>This past year China had the largest outbreak of deadly bird flu since the virus was first detected in March 2013. For the past 5 years, China has had annual waves of H7N9 outbreaks that peak around January and February.During the 2017 season, the country reported nearly the same number of cases as all 4 previous years combined, researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report [Thu 7 Sep 2017]. The virus cropped up in more geographic regions. And it showed signs of evolving in ways that cause concern.As NPR reported in April [2017], the virus has picked up mutations that make it more deadly in poultry and less susceptible to antiviral treatments. ""Our research shows it can kill all the chickens in our lab within 24 hours,"" virologist Guan Yi told NPR.H7N9 isn't your run-of-the-mill bird flu. H7N9 is ""the influenza virus with the highest potential pandemic risk,"" the CDC writes in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.In people, H7N9 can cause a severe form of pneumonia and progress into septic shock and multiorgan failure. ""We know of only a small number of people who presented with influenza-like symptoms and then recovered without medical attention,"" the World Health Organization says.During the 2017 outbreak, the Chinese government reported 759 cases of H7N9. There were 281 deaths -- about a third of those infected. By comparison in 2016 and 2015, the country reported 123 and 226 cases, respectively.Although H7N9 has potential to evolve [into] a global threat, right now it has one severe limitation that restricts its potential to spread: The virus doesn't transmit easily between people. About 90 percent of people catch the virus by handling poultry.But person-to-person transmission is possible. During 2017, there were 14 clusters of cases in which a person passed the disease to at least one other person.Since March 2013, there have been 1557 cases of H7N9 reported worldwide. All infections were caught in China, Hong Kong or Macao. Nearly 40 percent of those infections were deadly.[Byline: Michaeleen Doucleff]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] MMWR Update on A/H7N9Date: Fri 8 Sep 2017Source: CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) [sum., edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6635a2.htm>Among all influenza viruses assessed using CDC's Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT), the Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) virus (Asian H7N9), first reported in China in March 2013, is ranked as the influenza virus with the highest potential pandemic risk. During [1 Oct 2016] to [7 Aug 2017], the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China; CDC, Taiwan; the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection; and the Macao CDC reported 759 human infections with Asian H7N9 viruses, including 281 deaths, to the World Health Organization (WHO), making this the largest of the 5 epidemics of Asian H7N9 infections that have occurred since 2013. This report summarizes new viral and epidemiologic features identified during the 5th epidemic of Asian H7N9 in China and summarizes ongoing measures to enhance pandemic preparedness. Infections in humans and poultry were reported from most areas of China, including provinces bordering other countries, indicating extensive, ongoing geographic spread. The risk to the general public is very low and most human infections were, and continue to be, associated with poultry exposure, especially at live bird markets in mainland China. Throughout the 1st 4 epidemics of Asian H7N9 infections, only low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses were detected among human, poultry, and environmental specimens and samples. During the 5th epidemic, mutations were detected among some Asian H7N9 viruses, identifying the emergence of high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses as well as viruses with reduced susceptibility to influenza antiviral medications recommended for treatment. Furthermore, the 5th-epidemic viruses diverged genetically into 2 separate lineages (Pearl River Delta lineage and Yangtze River Delta lineage), with Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses emerging as antigenically different compared with those from earlier epidemics. Because of its pandemic potential, candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) were produced in 2013 that have been used to make vaccines against Asian H7N9 viruses circulating at that time. CDC is working with partners to enhance surveillance for Asian H7N9 viruses in humans and poultry, to improve laboratory capability to detect and characterize H7N9 viruses, and to develop, test and distribute new CVV that could be used for vaccine production if a vaccine is needed.Epidemiologic data were collected from the WHO Disease Outbreak News and Influenza Risk Assessment summaries, and from recent publications. Genetic and virus characterization data were collected from the publically accessible Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and GenBank databases. Nucleotide sequence alignments of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes were created and used to generate phylogenetic trees for lineage determination. Amino acid changes in 5th-epidemic viruses were identified through comparisons with CVVs produced using 2013 Asian H7N9 virus sequences, and identification of viruses as either LPAI or HPAI was accomplished by analysis of the HA cleavage site. CDC assessed the antigenic properties of virus isolates using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay employing a panel of reference ferret antisera that includes antisera raised to LPAI Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta fifth-epidemic viruses, HPAI H7N9 viruses, and the 2013 CVVs. The extent of cross-reactivity with 2013 CVVs and viruses from previous epidemics was assessed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The appearance of highly pathogenic A/H7N9 variants in poultry indicates that the virus continues to evolve. Although its human to human transmission mechanisms remain largely inefficient, the increasing spread of the virus to various provinces in China and more frequent avian to human transmission events require careful monitoring for the evolutionary changes. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
