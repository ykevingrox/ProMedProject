Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/europe-measles-update-romania-outbreak-now-3800-cases-92581/>A measles outbreak in Romania has been ongoing since February 2016 and cases continue to be reported despite ongoing response measures that have been implemented at national level through reinforced vaccination activities, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). From September 2016 to 17 Mar 2017, Romania has reported 3799 cases.In Italy, about 700 cases reported so far this year [2017], in Germany more than 200 cases and in Belgium more than 100 cases. Dozens of cases have also been reported from France, Spain, Hungary and Austria. In some countries, the spread of infection has occurred among health care workers.Measles is caused by a virus belonging to the paramyxovirus [family]. The disease is one of the most infectious diseases that exists. Measles virus excreted by breathing the air and spread through air droplets (aerosols). Susceptible people infected via the respiratory tract or mucous membranes of the eyes.The incubation period is 7-18 days, usually about 10 days. At the onset, measles is acute with rapidly rising fever, eye irritation and increasingly troublesome dry cough. After a day occurs a red and often confluent rash that usually is only seen in the face and then spreads down the trunk and extremities. Other early symptoms of measles are small white spots on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots).Complications are quite common. Toddlers often suffer from respiratory problems and the infected mucous membranes may become secondarily infected with bacteria. Children can then have, for example, otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia, which often requires antibiotic treatment. Measles virus is also capable of causing pneumonia in itself.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Also see Measles update (11) 20170309.4888914 report [4] on Romanian outbreak, and Measles update (14) 20170325.4924756, report [1]A Healthmap showing location of Romania can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Mod.LK]******[2] SyriaDate: Tue 28 Mar 2017Source: Syria:Direct [edited]<syriadirect.org/news/hundreds-of-children-infected-as-measles-outbreak-ravages-east-damascus-suburbs-%E2%80%98not-enough%E2%80%99-vaccines/>A ""major outbreak"" of measles is hitting the encircled, rebel-controlled Damascus suburbs of East Ghouta, with doctors telling Syria Direct that vaccine shortages are to blame for more than 350 cases of the easily preventable disease in less than 2 months.With up to 80 percent of children unvaccinated inside the 450 000-person opposition pocket, measles is making an alarming resurgence where such incidences were once ""very rare"" before the war, Amani, a pediatrician at the Kafr Batna hospital who asked to be referred to only by her 1st name, told Syria Direct. Doctors began seeing patients with the disease as recently as late December [2016], she said. ""By the beginning of February [2017], it became an outbreak,"" Amani said. Doctors across East Ghouta now tally more than 350 confirmed diagnoses of the disease, with new cases emerging on a daily basis.Measles is a viral disease that disproportionately affects young children, often with a fever, rash and potentially lethal complications that can be prevented by immunization. Vaccines, however, have either been slow or entirely unable to reach East Ghouta amidst the Assad regime's ongoing blockade and bombardment of the rebel-held territory, 2 km [approx 1.24 mi] east of Damascus. The encirclement, coupled with densely crowded living conditions due to mass internal displacement, are turning the 100 sq. km [approx. 38.6 sq mi] suburbs into a breeding ground for the highly contagious infection.As a result, hundreds of East Ghouta children now suffer from dangerously high fevers, severe respiratory issues and, in at least 2 instances, death.Even when the Syrian Arab Red Crescent delivered scores of vaccines to East Ghouta on [9 Mar 2017] -the first such shipment in months- doctors said the amount was ""hardly enough"" to treat the area's unvaccinated population.Dr. Amani describes the local hospital as ""packed with children"" waiting to receive 1 of the limited vaccines, which are often given on a 1st-come, 1st-serve basis. ""Inevitably, not all of the children will get the vaccine...what we have just isn't enough,"" she said.At least 2 people have died of measles-related complications since the start of the outbreak, including a 23-year-old woman in Kafr Batna and an 8-year-old girl in the town of Hamouriyah, 2km [approx 1.24 mi] northeast, earlier this month [March 2017].Children who are already symptomatic cannot be given a vaccine, and antiviral treatment does not currently exist for the disease. This means that doctors can only resort to palliative measures such as painkillers, antipyretics and IV fluids to ensure that the condition of patients, such 2-year-old MN, does not worsen. MN spent more than 15 days in the Kafr Batna hospital with upper respiratory problems, a rash characteristic of measles, and severe conjunctivitis. His condition deteriorated to such an extent that he was unable to open his eyes for 2 days, his mother, UM, told Syria Direct. ""I was incredibly worried for my child's life,"" she said. ""Even though he's doing relatively better now, I don't deny that I'm still afraid, both for his health and afraid that he may infect another child,"" said UM. Families with multiple, unvaccinated children living in 1 room such as UM's often see more than 1 child contract the virus.In patients with access to quality health care, measles can be managed. But for populations with malnutrition and inadequate health care, ""mortality can be as high as 10 percent,"" the France-based Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM) reported earlier this month [March 2017]. Children affected by measles within East Ghouta face an added risk of serious health complications given the dire food and medical shortages resulting from the opposition-held area's 5-year encirclement.Fears of measles-related complications stemming from severe malnutrition drastically increased last month [February 2017] after regime forces launched a campaign to cut East Ghouta's vital food and medical supply routes via underground tunnels, Syria Direct reported. The ongoing campaign is largely stalemated with little ground changing hands but has claimed dozens of lives.While disproportionately affecting the young, ""it's important to note that measles does not just affect children,"" said Dr. Ahmed al-Baqai, the director of the Save a Soul center, East Ghouta's only medical center specialized in infectious diseases and epidemics, which is in Kafr Batna. ""There are confirmed cases even with people over the age of 40,"" he added.The United Nations has been unable to transport vaccines to encircled towns within East Ghouta for several months because of ""fighting in the area, on the road, in addition to road closures due to security issues, lack of administrative permissions and facilitations and/or agreement between parties to the conflict,"" Linda Tom, a spokeswoman with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Syria Direct from Damascus.With doctors recording new cases of measles every day, ""time is running out for the people of East Ghouta,"" Elizabeth Hoff, the World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in Syria, said in a press statement on [Mon 27 Mar 2017]. ""As health needs increase, available resources are being depleted day by day.""Measles is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths, with more than 134 200 deaths attributed worldwide to the disease in 2015, the World Health Organization reported in November [2016]. That figure is down from an estimated 2.6 million annual measles-related deaths prior to widespread vaccination campaigns beginning in 1980.[Byline: Alaa Nassar, Mohammed al-Falouji, Adam a-Shami and Justin Schuster]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap showing location of Syria can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>. - Mod.LK]******[3] Ireland (Cork)Date: Tue 28 Mar 2017, 10:27 AMSource: Irish Mirror [edited]<http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/world-health-organisation-issue-measles-10112678>The World Health Organisation is working towards a measles free Europe in 2 years. The World Health Organisation has issued a measles warning for Europe as outbreaks of the illness rise. In January of this year [2017], over 500 cases of measles were reported in the European region.There is the potential to cause large outbreaks wherever immunization coverage has dropped below the necessary threshold of 95 percent.In Ireland in the period from February 2016 to January 2017, 45 cases of the measles were recorded. This gives Ireland an incidence rate of 9.5 people in every million getting the illness. This happens to be the 5th highest incidence rate in Europe behind Belgium, Tajikistan, Italy and Romania where it is particularly endemic.Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause potentially serious illness.As measles remains endemic in most parts of the world, it can spread to any country, including those that have eliminated the disease. Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said: ""With steady progress towards elimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that measles cases are climbing in Europe. Today's travel patterns put no person or country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will continue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the level of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.""The largest current measles outbreaks in Europe are taking place in Romania and Italy. Italy has seen a sharp rise in cases in the first weeks of 2017. So far 238 cases have been reported for January 2017 and preliminary information indicating at least as many cases for February [2017], the total number of cases reported for 2016, approximately 850, may soon be surpassed.Romania is the worst hit country and has reported over 3400 cases and 17 deaths since January 2016.
