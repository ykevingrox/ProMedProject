As of September 2016 there have been 10 reported cases in humans (all fatal) and over 30 reported in horses, cows, a donkey and a zebra. Most sources suggest that that _H. gingivalis_ is a common soil-dwelling nematode; however, reliable prevalence and distribution data are lacking.The 3 transplant-related cases have not been written up yet.

It is indeed intriguing how a nematode mostly infecting horses and cattle can infect humans. However, the nematode is free-living in soil and direct penetration of intact skin as we see in _Strongyloides stercoralis_ and hookworm infections is the most obvious possibility. Thus information on whether there has been skin contact, for instance by bare feet to the ground, is important.A recent review (Papadi B et al. _Halicephalobus gingivalis_: a rare cause of fatal meningoencephalomyelitis in humans. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2013;88:1062-4. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.12-0730. PubMed: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23509120>) states that ""These nematodes seem to exhibit neurotropism, but their life cycle, mode of infection, and risk factors are poorly understood.""It is not surprising that treatment is difficult especially in the CNS. It is not unusual that nematodes can remain alive for decades in humans, for instance _Trichinella_ spp., _Strongyloides stercoralis_ and _Taenia solium_. A case of _Dirofilaria repens_ treated with albendazole several times where the live worm was extracted by surgery has been described (Klintebjerg K et al. Periorbital _Dirofilaria repens_ imported to Denmark: A human case report. IDCases. 2014 Dec 12;2(1):25-6. doi: 10.1016/j.idcr.2014.12.001. eCollection 2015). - Mod.EP][There is mention of 3 cases associated with organ transplant.  More information on these cases would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP] [_Micronema deletrix_, _H. deletrix_, and _H. gingivalis_ are synonymous, with _H. gingivalis_ being the correct nomenclature (1)._Halicephalobus gingivalis_ is a free-living nematode that has the potential to be pathogenic. The nematode has thus far been reported to infect both horses (1) and humans (2). In common with other reports, only female nematodes were identified in the horse described here, suggesting that the organism multiplies by partheno- genesis (1,3,4).At least 31 cases of _H. gingivalis_ infection have been described in horses in the literature. These cases were reviewed recently by Anderson et al (1) and included infections involving the brain, kidney, maxilla, mandible, humerus, femur, stomach, adrenal gland, lymph nodes, spinal cord, lungs, and eye. This report also indicated that cases of _H. gingivalis_ have a wide geographic distribution, including Japan, North America, Colombia, Egypt, and several countries in Europe (1). The _H. gingivalis_ infection previously diagnosed in a horse in Canada was from a carcass in an Alberta slaughter facility (5). The antemortem clinical signs and origin of the horse were not known. In the horse reported here, there was no history of travel outside Ontario. Consequently, this is the 1st case of _H. gingivalis_ reported in a horse in Ontario and the 1st in Canada that was known to reside only in Canada.In horses, there may be various routes of entry, although an oral or nasal route seems likely. Since _H. gingivalis_ is a free-living nematode in the soil, the oral mucosa could be exposed to the parasite through contaminated feed, and the preputium exposed by direct contact with soil when the horse is recumbent. The route of the cerebral infection in this horse is consistent with hematogenous spread, as suggested in the literature (1).Recommendations for treatment of infection with _H. gingivalis_ at this time are unclear, due to the lack of knowledge regarding the route of entry of the organism and its susceptibility to anthelmintic drugs. In cases that were treated with ivermectin or benzimidazoles, the horses have failed to survive (4, 10-12). However, all these cases were in the terminal stages of the disease. In one case, in which the infection was limited to the prepuce, the successful treatment included a combination of ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine (4). In conclusion,_H. gingivalis_ infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis for osseous granulomatous lesions in horses in Canada [and likely in other locations as well]. Once the diagnosis of _H. gingivalis_ infection is made, a poor prognosis for recovery should be given. When diagnosis is made prior to the development of nervous signs, treatment may be attempted, but the potential for rapid neurological deterioration should be acknowledged.References:1.
