National Public Health Laboratory has confirmed 8 hepatitis A virus (HAV) in patients (out of 15 samples) from Besisahar, Lamjung [Province 4]. Age group distribution of the positive cases are, however, not mentioned in the report, as more than 90 percent children get infected with HAV before the age of 10 years in developing countries [1]. In fact, a 10-year serological survey of HAV in Nepal shows, a 99.1 percent prevalence rate in asymptomatic Nepali population [2], meaning HAV epidemics in Nepal, generally are not expected owing to its lifelong protection against subsequent infection. This notion is supported by a study done in Nepal, which found HAV in 3 percent among patients presenting with acute hepatitis [3]. Other infectious diseases that present similar symptoms to hepatitis cannot be underestimated or overlooked, especially during the rainy season.RÌ©fÌ©rences----------1. Jacobsen KH, Weirsma ST.
