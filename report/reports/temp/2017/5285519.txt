Blaine Hollinger MD <blaineh@bcm.edu>1. There is also a seronegative window period that precedes the first detection of HBV DNA and prior to the appearance of HBsAg following acute infection. However, the level of virus may not be sufficient to cause HBV based on the HBV genotype (Hsia et al, 2006).2. Is minipool NAT or ID NAT being done for HBV DNA detection by blood banks in Ireland? And if minipool NAT, how many samples were in the minipool since this could compromise sensitivity?3. Was the archived donor specimen also tested for total anti-HBc, a test done in US blood facilities, but not in Ireland?4. What is the evidence that the recipient was not previously infected with HBV, while bearing in mind that patients with chronic hepatitis B may be positive for IgM anti-HBc during acute reactivation of their disease. And if the recipient was IgM positive, what was the ratio of the anti-HBc test result based on the cutoff value and the patient's value?5. Fortunately, the outcome is usually favorable with limited risk of chronicity in immunocompetent patients who acquire acute hepatitis B.--F.

Casey Hepatitis Research CenterBaylor College of MedicineHouston, TX<blaineh@bcm.edu>[It is always an honor to receive comments from Dr. Hollinger, a long time leader in viral hepatitis research.Regarding his questions/comments:1. As I noted in the moderation of the original post, there is a lesser discussed ""window period"" occurring in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B prior to the development of HBsAg and before the development of anti-HBc (IgM and then IgG). The more classical ""window period"" occurs towards the end of acute hepatitis B, whether clinically overt or not, when HBsAg is not longer detectable by standard assays but before anti-HBs is detectable. The only serologic evidence of HBV is anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc should be positive. HBV DNA is also detectable. It has been shown that blood transfused during this period can be infectious for HBV.2-4. All good questions which I cannot supply answers to.5. Most patients who are not immunosuppressed will clear HBV within 3-6 months. 10 percent will not although half of these are usually clear within a year. No information regarding the patient in this case was supplied.- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39>.][See Also:Hepatitis B - Ireland: post-transfusion, seronegative blood  20170830.5284369Hepatitis B - Australia: (NS) 20170705.5152458Hepatitis B & C - USA (02): (VA) injection drug use 20170629.5140622Hepatitis B & C - USA: (NC) injection drug use 20170619.5115801Hepatitis B & C - Pakistan: (Sindh) 20170503.5009439Hepatitis B & C - global: WHO update 20170421.4985250Hepatitis B - China: (SD) hemodialysis unit 20170210.48306722016----Hepatitis B - Kenya: (TU) prison 20161215.4700896Hepatitis B - Uganda (03): (SE) 20161116.4628116Hepatitis B - USA (08): reactivation during hepatitis C therapy 20161007.4543334Hepatitis B - Uganda (02) 20160911.4480806Hepatitis B - USA (07) :(ME) injection drug use 20160907.4469090Hepatitis B & C - USA (02): (WV) cardiac tests, expanded numbers, RFI 20160619.4296498Hepatitis B - USA (06): (ME) injection drug use 20160615.4289817Hepatitis B & C - USA: (WV) cardiac tests 20160329.4126017Hepatitis B - USA (05): (NC) injection drug use, 2015, comment 20160303.4066823Hepatitis B - USA (04): (NC) injection drug use, 2015 20160303.4063893Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874Hepatitis B - USA (03): injection drug use, comment 20160211.4012860Hepatitis B - USA (02): injection drug use, comment 20160206.3999152Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234Hepatitis B - USA: (KY, WV, TN) injection drug use 20160130.3980173].................................................ll/ao/dk"
