The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has identified and is following up health care workers and household contacts of known MERS patients. As per Saudi Arabian policy, listed contacts were not allowed to attend Hajj.WHO risk assessmentMERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality. Close direct or indirect contact with infected dromedaries is the main source of primary human infections. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Reviewing the information provided in the WHO update comparing with information available through the MOH reports available at <http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx?PageIndex=1>:Case 1 was an asymptomatic household contact of another confirmed cases and was reported as a recovery on 6 Sep 2017.Case 2 was classified as a primary case with a history of indirect contact with camels and was reported as a fatality on 10 Sep 2017.Case 3 had been reported as high risk exposure history still under investigation on the MOH report and was reported as a fatality on 21 Sep 2017.Case 5 was reported as a recovery on 28 Sep 2017.Case 6 was reported as a fatality on 13 Sep died.Case 7 was reported as a recovery on 27 Sep 2017.Case 9 was reported as a fatality on 4 Oct 2017.In summary, of the 9 newly confirmed cases in the above WHO report, outcomes were known for 8 of the 9 cases, 5 of whom had fatal outcomes, With respect to high risk exposures, 5 of the 9 cases had a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, one was a household contact of a previously confirmed case, and 3 were classified as primary cases but high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness had not been identified.Of interest is that 4 of the 5 fatal cases had a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Of additional note is that all of the 8 symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>.]
