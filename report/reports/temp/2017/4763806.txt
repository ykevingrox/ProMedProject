According to data released on 29 Dec 2016 by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the disease also affected 39 000 persons [in Haiti] in 2016.The death toll from this disease increased by 41 percent as compared to 2015, while the cases of infection increased 24 percent, according to the report published in the country.The UN agency regretted that the resources received to combat the cholera outbreak in the Caribbean country were far below expectations in 2016. Of the USD 20.3 million needed by the UN for 2016, it received only USD 9.2 million.Cholera is expected to continue to cause fatalities in Haiti due to lack of funds and deteriorating health conditions, aggravated by the impact of hurricane Matthew last October 2016, which caused the worst humanitarian crisis in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, which left about 300 000 dead.The current outbreak of cholera was introduced in Haiti by a contingent of Nepalese deployed by the UN on the island to help after the earthquake of 2010. Since then, 800 000 people have been infected, of which more than 9000 have died, according to data from the WHO.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[Prior to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the infrastructure supplying clean water in the population was tenuous at best. The earthquake destroyed much of the ability to deal with human waste and supply safe potable water. When _Vibrio cholerae_ was then inadvertently introduced into the country, the epidemic spread quickly in this population due to the lack of clean water in an immunologically naÌøve population and had continued over the 6 years since the beginning. Hurricane Matthew produced an exclamation point to the on-going epidemic in its wake as a dramatic exaggeration to the yearly increases related to the rainy season. The beat of this dismal epidemic goes on and will not stop until adequate funding is obtained to rebuild an infrastructure.
