The rash eventually resolved after 3-5 days, but a few patients experienced arthralgias of the large joints, and one patient developed joint effusions. The illness was self-limiting, but the florid nature of the rash has prompted many persons to seek health care. The NICD has conducted several laboratory tests on over 40 persons, and has confirmed infection with Sindbis [virus] in the Johannesburg cases and West Nile virus in a patient from a farm in the Northern Cape province.The rashes associated with these Sindbis fever cases have included punctate papules on the trunk and limbs, palms and soles; some with small vesicles on the papules and some with characteristic halos around the papules; and some with slightly tender generalized lymphadenopathy. The rash associated with the West Nile fever case was more diffuse, with a macular/papular appearance.Sindbis and West Nile virus infections are well documented in South Africa in the summer months especially in years with good rainfall, but the clinical illness is not always recognized and is variously diagnosed as coxsackie infections and other viral exanthems. These 2 viruses co-circulate as they share a common vector -- culicine mosquitoes -- and avian hosts. Outbreaks of Sindbis and West Nile fevers have been reported simultaneously on the Highveld of South Africa in 1974, 1984, and in 2004.Infections with Sindbis and West Nile viruses should not be confused with tick bite fever, which is also common during the summer season. While there is some overlap in the dermatological manifestations, typically tick bite fever patients have severe headache and high fever. The diagnosis of tick bite fever is typically a clinical one and the finding of an eschar in persons with acute febrile illness must prompt treatment with doxycycline. PCR of eschar swabs during the acute phase and serology only after 10 days of illness may serve to confirm the diagnosis of tick bite fever. However diagnostic uncertainty should not delay treatment with doxycycline. Malaria is important to consider during the period September to May in all persons with acute febrile illness returning from malaria transmission areas in southern Africa.--Prof Lucille Blumberg<lucilleb@nicd.ac.za>andIrma Latsky <irmal@nicd.ac.za> on behalf of the Division of Public Health Response and the Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic DiseasesNational Institute for Communicable Diseases,No 1 Modderfontein Rd SandringhamJohannesburg,South Africa[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Blumberg and Ms Latsky for sharing these observations with us. The NICD press release can be accessed at <http://www.nicd.ac.za/?page=alerts&id=5&rid=721>The USA CDC indicates that about 1 in 5 people who are infected with West Nile virus ...""will develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with this type of West Nile virus disease recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months."" (<https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/symptoms/index.html>).Sindbis is among the most widely distributed of arboviruses. Cases have been documented in South Africa, Europe, Eurasia, Oceania, and Australia. A recent report states (reference below), ""The epidemiological features of Sindbis fever in humans in South Africa are described here based on a retrospective study of suspected arbovirus cases submitted for laboratory investigation from 2006 to 2010. Cases were detected annually mostly during the late summer/early autumn months and an increase in cases was noted for 2010, coinciding with an outbreak of Rift Valley fever. Cases were reported most often from the central plateau of South Africa and involved mostly males. No severe or fatal cases were reported and cases were associated with febrile arthralgia as commonly reported for SINV infection. Further surveillance is required to reveal the true extent of the morbidity of Sindbis fever in South Africa."" The observations reported above by Dr Blumberg and colleagues add to information about the clinical picture of Sindbis virus infections in South Africa [1].An additional report states, ""Symptoms [of Sindbis virus infection] include fever, malaise, rash and musculoskeletal pain. In a significant portion of patients the debilitating musculoskeletal symptoms persist for years. Chronic disease after SINV infection shares many features with autoimmune diseases. Currently there is no specific treatment available. Recently SINV infections have been detected outside the previously known distribution range. In this article we will summarize the current knowledge on epidemiology, clinical disease and pathogenesis of SINV infection in man."" [2]References---------1.
