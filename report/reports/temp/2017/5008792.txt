La Naci√å n [in Spanish, trans. KS, edited]<http://www.lanacion.com.co/index.php/actualidad-lanacion/item/287152-alerta-por-brote-de-leishmaniasis-en-neiva>The health authorities of Neiva [Huila department] have issued an epidemiological alert regarding an outbreak of leishmaniasis. According to the municipal health secretary, Faiver Segura Ochoa, the disease has already left one child dead and 3 people severely affected. ""The victim of this deadly disease was a 4 month old baby,"" the official said.Segura Ochoa said that the outbreak began in the settlement of Lomas de San Pedro, Comuna Nueve in the city. ""According to information gathered by the local office, there is a large street population of canines, of which more than 50 per cent tested positive for the leishmaniasis parasite,"" said the official.The official said that since [26 Apr 2017], the day the epidemiological alert was issued, the necessary security measures have been taken. The Health Ministry yesterday [28 Apr 2017] sent a health brigade to the sector with the mandate to take preventive action to prevent the spread of the outbreak. ""So far we have offered all institutional resources, including environmental sanitation, insurance, service provision, mental and reproductive health, to give people all of the services they require,"" he said.""What we hope to do, is to test the canine population and assess children under 5 for the disease. The key is to make a timely diagnosis because the response to treatment is very effective when it is done on time,"" he added. Likewise, fumigation and prevention campaigns have been carried out and special tents have been provided to mitigate the spread of the disease.The Municipal Administration explained that, as of now, they have tested about 1000 dogs -- reservoirs of the disease -- of which at least 500 have been positive for leishmaniasis. In this situation, the canines will be sacrificed, following safety protocols and with the aim of preventing major health problems. ""Unfortunately for these types of cases, the only real solution is euthanization. They can be treated with allopurinol and meglumine, but the animals may show a slight improvement and then manifest the disease again in a few months. Reservoirs will continue to transmit the disease, and, however much we treat it, will remain an imminent risk for people,"" said councilor and veterinarian Mayra Zambrano.Segura Ochoa added that these actions will continue to be carried out in other settlements and communes of the city. Similarly, he called on the entire population to ""keep the environment clean"" and to use repellents and mosquito nets on children, with the aim of ""killing the mosquitoes"" that cause this condition.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Colombia is one of the 3 countries with the highest number of _Leishmania_ species affecting humans in the world (7 species in total). Around 90.3 per cent of all cases are CL (cutaneous leishmaniasis); 0.4 per cent are MCL (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis), and 0.3 per cent are VL (visceral leishmaniasis). The disease predominates in a large part of the country, especially in sylvatic foci and in the inter-Andean valleys, where working in coffee plantations can be seen as a risk factor. Epidemic outbreaks of CL caused by _L. braziliensis_, _L. guyanensis_, and _L. panamensis_, with intra and peridomiciliary transmission, have been reported since 1984. Urbanization of the disease has been observed in recent years (Alvat J et al: Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence.
