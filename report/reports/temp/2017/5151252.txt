Symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty in moving. JE is a serious disease that may cause death.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Little clinical data relating to these 2 cases is provided, nor is any information given about the circumstances under which they became infected. Although avoidance of mosquito bites as recommended in the full report above is prudent, vaccination is the best protective measure. The virus is endemic in north western India with birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult. - Mod.TYMaps of India can be accessed at<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306>.]
