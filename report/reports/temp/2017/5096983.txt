Global expansion of chikungunya virus: mapping the 64-year history.--------------------------------------Highlights- Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus.- The global distribution shows that CHIKV is expanding at an alarming rate.- CHIKV has the potential to spread to new areas because it is a travel-associated febrile illness.- The 4 different genotypes of CHIKV are Asian, West African, East/Central/South African (ECSA), and Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL).- The disease originated in Africa and has since affected the entire globe.- This global health menace has affected millions of people in tropical and sub-tropical countries.SummaryChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that is emerging as a global threat because of the highly debilitating nature of the associated disease and unprecedented magnitude of its spread. Chikungunya originated in Africa and has since spread across the entire globe causing large numbers of epidemics that have infected millions of people in Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Europe, the Americas, and Pacific Islands. Phylogenetic analysis has identified 4 different genotypes of CHIKV: Asian, West African, East/Central/South African (ECSA), and Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL). In the absence of well-designed epidemiological studies, the aim of this review article was to summarize the global epidemiology of CHIKV and to provide baseline data for future research on the treatment, prevention, and control of this life-threatening disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail readers interested in this historical and current overview of CHKV are urged to see the entire article at the above URL. - Mod.TY]******[3] Comorbidity and diseaseDate: Sat 29 Apr 2017Source: The Indian Express [edited]<http://indianexpress.com/article/india/28-patients-have-comorbidity-study-link-with-other-diseases-adds-to-chikungunyas-sting-4632612/>Less than a year after the capital saw its worst ever chikungunya [fever] outbreak, an AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Sciences] study has revealed that the vector-borne infection is associated with ""significant morbidity."" The study also revealed that the disease, due to comorbidity, can lead to neurological complications and multi-organ dysfunction. Comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional diseases or disorders co-occurring with a primary disease. In case of chikungunya, the presence of certain diseases -- such as hypertension and diabetes -- makes a person more vulnerable to the vector-borne infection, the study has found.The AIIMS study, which examined prevalence of concurrent infections in patients with chikungunya fever, revealed that 28 percent of the patients were found to have comorbidity, indicating the viral infection can prove fatal to those suffering from such conditions.The study further revealed that the outbreak was associated with ""atypical"" complications associated with chikungunya [virus infections], with 7 percent of the total cases examined under the study resulting in death. ""However, the deaths cannot be attributed to the mosquito-borne infection alone,"" professor Sanjeev Sinha, department of medicine at AIIMS, said.The study, which examined 264 cases, revealed that hypertension (10.2 percent), diabetes (9.4 percent), chronic kidney disease (3.7 percent) and cardiac illness (3 percent) were the most common comorbid conditions associated with chikungunya [virus] infection.[Byline: Kaunain Sheriff M]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Arthralgia persistenceDate: April 2017Source: Emerg Infect Dis. 2017;23(4):673-676. <https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2304.161562> [edited]<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/4/16-1562_article>Feldstein LR, Rowhani-Rahbar A, Staples J, Weaver MR, Halloran M, Ellis EM, et al. Persistent Arthralgia Associated with Chikungunya Virus Outbreak, US Virgin Islands, December 2014-February 2016.-------------------------------------AbstractAfter the 2014-2015 outbreak of chikungunya virus in the US Virgin Islands [USVI], we compared the prevalence of persistent arthralgia among case-patients and controls. Prevalence was higher in case-patients than controls 6 and 12 months after disease onset. Continued vaccine research to prevent acute illness and long-term sequelae is essential.ConclusionsFrom our year-long study of 165 case-patients and 167 controls, we found an almost 3-fold increased risk for persistent arthralgia in CHIKV case-patients at 6 and 12 months after illness onset. At 12 months, case-patients were significantly (p less than 0.01) more likely than controls to report difficulty performing daily activities. Our unadjusted persistent arthralgia estimates at 6 (44 percent) and 12 (33 percent) months fall within the pooled estimate from a meta-analysis (40 percent, 95 percent CI 31-49 percent).Consistent with findings in previous studies, case-patients in our study reported a higher prevalence of foot-specific joint pain. Furthermore, a higher proportion of case-patients reported the presence of persistent arthralgia and of more severe arthralgia in the morning; this finding is consistent with those from previous studies reporting a high prevalence of morning stiffness among case-patients.Our results emphasize that, in the USVI, CHIKV illness was associated with persistent arthralgia and difficulty with daily activities one year after disease onset. These findings highlight the need for therapeutic and vaccine research to manage and prevent acute illness and long-term sequelae associated with CHIKV infection. The results also underscore the need for studies to identify risk factors for long-term sequelae of CHIKV illness, to estimate the burden of persistent arthralgia after acute illness, and to understand the effect of persistent arthralgia on quality of life.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Many observational reports have stated that arthralgia resulting from chikungunya virus infection can persist for months or even years. The arthralgia can be so severe as to be incapacitating, adversely affecting the quality of life. The above study provides some quantification of the resulting arthralgia in 165 case patients. Interestingly, a study reported on 17 Feb 2017 found that when the gene for the enzyme granzyme A was missing, chikungunya virus caused far less swelling and arthritis. When the enzyme was inhibited, there was far less swelling and arthritis (<https://mysunshinecoast.com.au/news/news-display/study-finds-link-between-enzyme-and-arthritis-caused-by-chikungunya-virus,47957>), indicating a target for treatment. - Mod.TY]******[5] TreatmentDate: Wed 1 Feb 2017Source: Science Translational Medicine Vol. 9, Issue 375, DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aah3438 [edited]<http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/375/eaah3438>Jonathan J.

Therapy with CTLA4-Ig and an antiviral monoclonal antibody controls chikungunya virus arthritis.---------------------------------AbstractIn 2013, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) transmission was documented in the Western Hemisphere, and the virus has since spread throughout the Americas with more than 1.8 million people infected in more than 40 countries. CHIKV targets the joints, resulting in symmetric polyarthritis that clinically mimics rheumatoid arthritis and can endure for months to years. At present, no approved treatment is effective in preventing or controlling CHIKV infection or disease. We treated mice with 8 different disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and identified CLTA4-Ig (abatacept) and tofacitinib as candidate therapies based on their ability to decrease acute joint swelling. CTLA4-Ig reduced T cell accumulation in the joints of infected animals without affecting viral infection. Whereas monotherapy with CTLA4-Ig or a neutralizing anti-CHIKV human monoclonal antibody provided partial clinical improvement, therapy with both abolished swelling and markedly reduced levels of chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and infiltrating leukocytes. Thus, combination CTLA4-Ig and antiviral antibody therapy controls acute CHIKV infection and arthritis and may be a candidate for testing in humans.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[One hopes that this treatment is ultimately effective in humans, many of whom suffer incapacitating arthralgia for months. - Mod.TY]******[6] Persistent vascular diseaseDate: Sun 12 Feb 2017Source: BBC [in Portuguese, trans.

Of these, 20 repeated the examinations, and it was found that 65 percent maintained the chronic vascular alterations.""Vascular manifestations in chikungunya [virus infections] were restricted to early stages of the disease. Now, the study shows not only a new manifestation but also its chronicity, since the symptoms persisted for more than 3 months,"" says Catarina Almeida, vascular surgeon responsible for the study.Patients presented with problems such as acute lymphedema (accumulation of fluid in the legs due to blockage of the lymphatic system) and edema in the dorsum of the foot.Lymphatic changes were detected by lymphoscintigraphy. It is still unknown why chronic vascular lesions reach only the lower limbs.""Our next step now is to do a molecular investigation and understand why this happens, whether it is the patient's exacerbated infection or the direct action of the virus,"" Almeida told the reporter.The researchers further explain that patient morbidity increases with these lesions, and they are more susceptible to infection in the lower limbs. ""In addition, chronic lymphedema has no cure; it's irreversible,"" [Almeida said].[Byline: Diana Brito]--Communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[A new clinical manifestation of chikungunya virus infection is described in Brazil.
