Infection can also occur from the bite of infected insects (most commonly ticks and deer flies) as well as exposure to soil and vegetation. Hunters who skin animals without gloves and are exposed to infected blood through an open wound are also at risk.""Although there are no human cases of tularemia identified in Pueblo so far this year [2017], Colorado has experienced human tularemia cases in people who have been exposed to contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water, or inhaling the bacteria,"" stated Vicki Carlton, program manager in the Environmental Health Division at the Pueblo City-County Health Department.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Tularemia is caused by the gram negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere._Francisella tularensis_ subsp. tularensis_(Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread by contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMBA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209>.]
