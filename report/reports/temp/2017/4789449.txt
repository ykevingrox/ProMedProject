""Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, is still conducting more detailed tests to find out whether anthrax bacteria were found in the victim who died on [Fri 6 Jan 2017] that would require verification from the Health R&D lab,"" Oscar added in a written statement received by Tempo on [Sun 22 Jan 2017].He has dismissed the reports doing rounds on social media that 15 people in Kulon Progo were admitted to Sardjito Hospital for anthrax. ""It was false. Dr. Sardjito Hospital only treated 1 patient with suspected anthrax. There is no need to worry because the hospital is safe to visit and get treatment,"" he said.Kulon Progo Health Office, he said, had earlier launched an investigation together with the Animal Husbandry Office, the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) of the Gadjah Mada University's (UGM) Department of Medicine, the Health R&D Department's INA-RESPOND, Wates Veterinarian Center and Dr. Sardjito Hospital.""The outcome will be verified by the Health Ministry,"" he said. The team had confirmed that it had found no further cases of anthrax among humans. Kulon Progo Health Office can still handle the case in the area.Oscar has reassured to Kulon Progo residents that there is no need to worry about consuming meat, provided that they buy certified meat, cook it well in a temperature of 100 deg C [approx 212 deg F] for 5-10 minutes and continue to adopt clean and healthy lifestyle (PHBS).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We can only wait and see what emerges from what is, after all, a single victim who unfortunately died. God willing, it will turn out not to be anthrax. The previous report had samples taken from the meat of suspected affected cattle that were taken to the medical and to the veterinary diagnostic laboratories. That together should be enough for a confident diagnosis. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/549>.]
