EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The Minister of Health sent out a letter to its agencies confirming the Lassa fever outbreak in Ogun State. He instructed them to raise the threat level and carry out awareness campaign to prevent the incident growing to an epidemic.--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberDr Chidozie Ugwu[The seriousness of the Lassa fever outbreak in Ogun state has been recognized with an increased threat level by the Ministry of Health. This is important for health care professionals in health centers to avoid nosocomial transmission. A committee addressing Lassa fever has made valuable recommendations that should contribute to the reduction of human cases both in and outside health centers. The risk of infection remains in rodent populations. The virus is endemic in multimammate rodents (_Mastomys_ spp).Interestingly, the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no 20161221.4713167) of suspected Lassa fever cases in Ogun state included a request for information about confirmation, or not, of the etiology of these cases. The response of EpiCore participants in Nigeria was swift and gratifying. To date, 20 responses have been received confirming the cases as Lassa fever, an illustration of the effectiveness of the EpiCore system in Nigeria. ProMED-mail thanks these respondents.Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/618>. - Mod.TY]
