From [1 Jan to 6 Aug 2017] (epidemiological week 31), a total of 2467 clinically diagnosed cases including 37 related deaths (case fatality ratio - 1.5 percent) were reported through the Electronic Disease Early Warning System (eDEWS) in Yemen [see <http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Epi_Monitor_2017_10_35.pdf>].Editorial note: Suspected cases of meningitis continue to be reported from different governorates of Yemen since the beginning of the current year [2017]. During the month of April 2017, the number of suspected cases increased followed by a gradual decline in the following 2 months (May and June 2017). Cases were reported across 1900 health facilities in the country; these sites function as sentinel reporting sites for the national electronic disease early warning system in the country.The highest number of suspected meningitis cases was reported from Amanat Al-Asimah governorate with 629 Cases (25.5 percent); other governorates reporting high number of cases include: Taiz with 355 cases (14.4 percent), Dhamar with 244 cases (9.9 percent), Ibb with 214 cases (8.7 percent), Al Hodeida with 166 cases (6.7 percent) and Aden with 141 cases (5.7 percent). These governorates reported such high number of cases because they host the main referral hospitals that serve as sentinel sites for the national bacterial meningitis surveillance programme in Yemen.A total of 1006 cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected, from [1 Jan to 20 Aug 2017], from 10 sentinel sites of national bacterial meningitis surveillance programme spread across the country. Of these samples, only 5 samples have tested positive for _Streptococcus pneumoniae_; 2 for _Neisseria meningitidis_ W135; and 11 samples were positive for other bacteria. Almost 80 percent of the CSF samples yielded no result.[Byline: Martina Tesser]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Of a total of 2467 clinically diagnosed cases of suspected bacterial meningitis in various governorates of Yemen this year [2017], 1006 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected, but we are not told exactly what testing was done on these samples; presumably the samples were all cultured for bacteria. A prior report from WHO said, ""cerebrospinal fluid samples have been tested by gram stain and culture"" (<http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/who-emro-weekly-epidemiological-monitor-volume-10-issue-31-30-july-2017>).We are told in the reports above that ""almost 80 percent of CSF samples yielded no results"", i.e., about 804 samples presumably had negative grams stains for bacteria and failed to grow bacteria, which suggests that most cases were non-bacterial, i.e., the illnesses were due to mostly viral meningitis or not really meningitis at all.The previous WHO report suggested that the ""low number of CSF samples that have tested positive [for bacterial meningitis] could be due to excessive self-medication with antibiotics given restricted access to health care due to insecurity; and possibly due to sample handling and limited capacity of local laboratory capacity given the current status of health infrastructure in the country"" (<http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/who-emro-weekly-epidemiological-monitor-volume-10-issue-31-30-july-2017>).However, we are left with 202 CSF samples that presumably yielded ""results""; but only grew bacteria in 18 CSF samples, 2 of which grew _Neisseria meningitidis_, the most common cause for outbreaks of bacterial meningitis. What were the ""results"" for the other 184 CSF samples? Was the CSF gram stain positive for bacteria, but culture-negative? Gram-positive, culture-negative CSF could be attributed to effects of prior antibiotic therapy. ProMED-mail would appreciate clarification in this regard from knowledgeable sources.In any case, compared to prior years, the WHO report above concludes that ""the current trend of meningitis cases is within the normal or ""endemic range"" and no evidence of existence of an outbreak of meningitis is seen or proven so far.""Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah) and 1 municipality (amanah), which can be seen on a map at <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen>. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.].................................................sb/ml/ao/ml/dk"
