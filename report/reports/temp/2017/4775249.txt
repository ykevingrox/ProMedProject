Of note is that the above WHO update contains information on a newly reported case that had not previously been reported on the Saudi MoH MERS-CoV website (case no.4 above). This case may well be the individual reported as a recovery on 6 Jan 2017, reported then as a 60 year old Saudi male from Madinah. If so, this would increase the official number of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by Saudi Arabia since September 2012 to 1538 cases.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
