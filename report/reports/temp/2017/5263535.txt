Among these cases there were 32 deaths, as follows: 8 in Timis County, 6 in Arad, 7 in Dolj, 3 in Caras-Severin, and one in each Bihor, Cluj, Calarasi, Satu Mare, Vaslui, Galati, Mures, and Bucharest. Measles outbreaks have been registered in all 41 counties, the most affected -- with over 1000 cases each -- being Timis (1215 cases), Caras-Severin (1110), and Arad (1002).The measles outbreak in Romania in 2016 is not circumstantial, but a direct consequence of the ""major"" malfunctions in public policy regarding vaccination, minister of health Florian Bodog stated on [Fri 11 Aug] in a press release. ""For years now Romania has been below the safety threshold of vaccination coverage. That is, the risk of a measles outbreak was imminent. Which is what actually happened. The outbreak of the measles epidemic in 2016 is not conjectural, it is a direct consequence of major malfunctions in the public policy on vaccination,"" the minister of health stated.According to him, the Vaccination Law corrects the irregularities that led to the epidemic, providing the best conditions for protecting children's health. ""For Romania, the stake of the vaccination bill is huge. Ensuring a healthy future for 4 million children lies in our hands. The Romanian parliament, the highest institution of democracy, will decide on the final content of this law. However, beyond the debates in parliament, it is important that all the public opinion be informed and understand the true meaning of the law and the profound changes it brings. (...) We have a moral duty towards our children, to prevent harm before it happens. As we also have a moral duty to the community in which we live to prevent harm before it happens to other children or parents,"" Bodog said, quoted in the press release.He added that any bill is amendable and that is why it is open to any public debates as long as they are carried out with honesty, good sense and decency. ""But this project is the day-to-day work of specialists in the field of vaccination and who have faced all the flaws of the current framework. That is why the law has been carefully and correctly thought through by those who best understand how to regulate the vaccination policy,"" the minister of health also said.The bill on the organisation and funding of public vaccination in Romania was adopted by the government on [Wed 9 Aug 2017]. The bill was submitted to parliament for debate and adoption. The normative act would come into force on 1 Jan 2018.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A similar report can be found in El Pais (12 Aug 2017) which states in addition that, of the 95 per cent vaccine coverage recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), 86 per cent [have been vaccinated] since 2007, according to its national epidemiological centre. ""Highly worrying"" figures, acknowledged the prime minister, Mihai Tudose, this week. ""More than 180 000 children in our country, from 9 months to 9 years, are not immunized against measles. In some regions, the rate of immunization of the 2nd dose does not reach 50 per cent; and this is very serious."" Timis and Caras-Severin, Arad (all to the west of the country, near the border with Serbia or Hungary), are the most affected, with more than 1000 measles cases each, reported in the last 10 months when the outbreak was declared.According to official estimates, nearly 50 000 children without immunization are not even registered with a family doctor. Most is due to serious problems of social exclusion.Submitted by Kathryn Soderholm <kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com> from ProMED-ESP archive no 20170814.5248771 and translated by Mod.LKMaps of Romania can be found at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Mod.LK]******[2] France (ArdÌ¬che)Date: Thu 17 Aug 2017 11:39 CESTSource: Silver Times [edited]<https://sivertimes.com/ardeche-four-hospitalizations-related-to-a-measles-outbreak/64380>A measles outbreak was declared in Ardoix, in the northern ArdÌ¬che, reports France Blue. 6 people -- 2 adults and 4 children, including some infants -- were infected by the virus between early July and 9 Aug [2017]. 4 patients had to be hospitalized. The 6 people are now out of danger, and the 4 hospitalised patients were able to return home, says the regional Agency of health (ARS), Auvergne-RhÌ«ne-Alpes, cited by France Bleu. These are all people who live or work in this small town of 1100 habitats.The ARS called for vigilance and prompted the inhabitants of the northern ArdÌ¬che, to consult a doctor in case of fever and appearance of buttons [rash]. It alerted on the very high contagiousness of the virus that can infect up to 20 people around a sick person, and they can produce severe, even life-threatening disease -- in fact, there is no curative treatment for measles.In addition, the ARS has been reported to France Bleu that the recent confirmed cases of measles in Ardoix were unvaccinated. According to the figures of the LRA, 71 per cent of the inhabitants of the ArdÌ¬che region are vaccinated against measles, which is 10 per cent less than the national average.The government has confirmed its willingness to make mandatory 8 vaccines, including measles. On this disease, ""Vaccination coverage among children at 2 years of age reaches only 78 per cent. As long as it does not reach the 95 per cent the risk of epidemic wave periodic will persist"", has declared AgnÌ¬s Buzyn.Measles has made its 1st victim in France at the end of July 2017. A young girl, a 16 year old native of Nice, has succumbed to this infectious disease in the hospital North of Marseille, after having been hospitalized in intensive care for 3 weeks. The girl had never been vaccinated against measles.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of France can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France#Administrative_divisions> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62734>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******Middle East---[3] Israel ex UkraineDate: Mon 14 Aug 2017 18:11 IDTSource: The Jerusalem Post [edited]<http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Nine-soldiers-recover-after-being-infected-with-measles-502391>The IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] said on [Mon 14 Aug 2017] that 9 soldiers diagnosed last week [week of 7 Aug 2017] with the highly infectious measles are all recovering and have returned to duty. According to the IDF, the soldiers all had mild cases of the disease and did not serve in the same unit.The index case had just returned from visiting family in the Ukraine where he likely contracted the disease. When he returned to Israel he visited a clinic where he infected 8 other soldiers who were waiting in line to see a physician. ""The IDF, together with the Health Ministry, carried out an investigation to locate the cases and identify the source of the infection,"" the army said in a statement, adding that all those who had contact with the soldiers [had been] given preventative treatment. An IDF spokesman told The Jerusalem Post that the soldier who contracted the disease had 2 stopovers in Europe on his way back to Israel from the Ukraine but was not able to specify which countries.WHO in March [2017] warned of a measles outbreak sweeping across Europe in places where immunization rates have plummeted. The figures cover the agency's entire European region -- 53 countries including Israel, Kazakhstan, and Russia. According to WHO 559 measles cases were reported in Europe between January and March 2017. While the largest current measles outbreaks in Europe were reported in Romania and Italy, other countries reporting cases were France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, and the Ukraine. ""With steady progress toward elimination over the past 2 years, it is of particular concern that measles cases are climbing in Europe,"" said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe. ""Today's travel patterns put no person or country beyond the reach of the measles virus. Outbreaks will continue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the level of immunization needed to fully protect their populations.""Israeli children are routinely immunized with the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine which are given in 2 doses, at 1 year and a booster in the 1st grade. The Health Ministry has stated that the level of vaccine coverage in Israel is among the highest in the West, with 97 per cent coverage for 1st and 2nd doses MMR and chickenpox vaccine.While no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, an infectious disease specialist told the Post that measles is ""a nasty illness"" that is preventable by proper immunization. But while it is highly recommended by medical professionals and the Health Ministry, the vaccine is not mandatory and according to the IDF the measles vaccine is not part of the vaccines given to new recruits. ""We cannot afford to have soldiers who are severely ill with a highly contagious disease. It would be appropriate for the IDF to verify and update immunizations of all personnel and new recruits,"" the infectious disease specialist told the Post.Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing and close contact with infected individuals. While most infected people usually experience only mild symptoms it is one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. Measles takes about 8-12 days following contact before the individual will show symptoms which include a fever, bad cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. A few days after the respiratory symptoms, the infected individual will get a bad rash. Other complications of measles include gastroenteritis (diarrhea and vomiting), pneumonia, severe bleeding problems, and in some rare cases encephalitis (brain infections).In June [2017], 5 cases of measles were reported to the Health Ministry -- all of them women between the ages of 20-40 who lived in Jerusalem.[byline: Anna Ahronheim]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Even with 97 per cent vaccine coverage, measles virus can cause small outbreaks.

""The Ministry of Health is undertaking a number of measures to control the spread of the disease, including investigating the extent of its spread in Kampala and Wakiso,"" said director of health services, Prof Anthony Mbonye.Measles is an airborne disease that affects mostly children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years, although it can also affect adults.Although Prof Mbonye said there was no cause for alarm, he urged the public to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the nearest health facilities. The public has also been urged to look out for common early symptoms associated with the disease, which include high fever, cough, red swelling eyelids and muscle and body irritability.According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 20 per cent of people who get infected with measles often develop complications, which if not managed early enough can lead to death. Despite previous mass vaccination campaigns, Uganda has had several outbreaks of the disease. Prof Mbonye blamed it on parents who do not take their children for immunisation at the right time. Current national immunisation coverage stands at 85 per cent.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[According to WHO, in 2016 global vaccination coverage (all vaccines) was stalled at 86 per cent, with no significant changes during the past year. For measles alone, by the end of 2016, 85 per cent of children had received 1 dose of vaccine by their 2nd birthday, and 164 countries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization; 64 per cent of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to national immunization schedules. It is generally thought that because measles is such a highly transmissible disease, that 90-95 per cent of people must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population, or achieve herd immunity.Maps of Uganda can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97> - Mod.LK]******Pacific---[5] Australia (Perth, Western Australia)Date: Fri 18 Aug 2017 9:58 AM AWSTSource: The West Australian [edited]<https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/third-case-of-measles-among-students-at-steiner-school-ng-b88572888z>Health authorities have confirmed a 3rd case of measles in a student from the Perth Waldorf School [Western Australia, WA] and warned there could be more.
