The San Diego Union-Tribune [edited]<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/sd-me-hepatitis-update-20171003-story.html>Add 20 more cases and 22 more hospitalizations to San Diego County's ever-growing hepatitis A outbreak.Tuesday afternoon [3 Oct 2017] the county Health and Human Services Agency bumped the outbreak's confirmed cases from 461 to 481 and hospitalizations from 315 to 337. The death count associated with the outbreak, which started in November 2016, remained at 17 for a 2nd straight week.For the last 2 weeks, the health department has reported having more than 40 cases under investigation awaiting confirmation from the CDC that they are of the same unique strains associated with other outbreak cases. No information on the number of cases under investigation was available. All of those who have died during the outbreak have had underlying medical conditions such as liver disease. Most were also homeless and/or drug users.Vaccination events continue throughout the city as public health officials focus on those at the highest risk of infection such as health and safety workers and those who work with homeless outreach organizations and food service workers. Hepatitis A infection is seldom fatal unless other complications, such as liver disease or an autoimmune disorder, are already present.The hepatitis A virus is shed in human feces and is transmitted when a person accidentally consumes a small amount of fecal matter left on food, drinks, drugs or other materials. Proper hand hygiene, washing with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom, is sufficient to kill the virus, though alcohol-based hand sanitizer may not be effective. Hepatitis A symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea.[Byline: Paul Sisson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[2] San Diego: emergency declarationDate: Tue 3 Oct 2017 6:32 AM PDTSource: Fox5, San Diego, City News Service [edited]<http://goo.gl/RzCqej>An emergency declaration over a lack of shelter space, which has exacerbated a deadly outbreak of hepatitis A among San Diego's homeless population, was approved Mon 2 Sep 2017, by the City Council. The council action was taken on an 8-0 vote even though Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who supported the declaration, said all of the affordable shelter beds haven't been filled. Councilman Chris Cate was absent. The declaration strengthens an earlier version that was already in place.""This is a really important policy tool that will allow us to be able to look at the reasonable suspension of regulatory statutes, regulations, and ordinances that otherwise are providing a barrier for us to get services, programs and facilities up and running faster, said Councilman Chris Ward, who chairs the council's Select Committee on Homelessness.The City Attorney's office said an updated declaration will also provide legal protections to certain projects meant to alleviate homelessness.The declaration comes amid an outbreak of hepatitis A, which has had a heavy impact on the homeless. County health officials said 461 people have become ill and 17 have died in the second-largest outbreak in the USA since a vaccine became available 22 years ago.Councilman David Alvarez proposed the declaration last month [September 2017], calling for immediate action because of the fatalities. Since then, city officials have been washing and disinfecting streets and began a pilot program to keep 14 public restrooms in Balboa Park open 24 hours a day. Additionally, the county has set up around 40 hand-washing stations -- concentrated in areas where the homeless congregate.Mayor Kevin Faulconer told the council members that homelessness was the [number one] social service issue in the city. ""It is up to us throughout the county -- particularly here in the city -- to step up our efforts, which we have in cleaning sidewalks, offering shelter to individuals as an alternative to sleeping on our streets,"" Faulconer said. ""I would also note that our existing shelters are still not at full capacity."" He said safe camping zones, where the homeless can set up tents, should be open in a matter of days.""We are all in this together, and the eyes of the nation are upon us,"" Faulconer said. ""We are the last line of defense for many of our most vulnerable men and women.""In January 2017's annual tally of the area's transient population, 5619 homeless individuals were counted in the city of San Diego, a 10.3 percent increase from last year [2016]. Of those, 3231 were living on the streets.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[3] San Diego: risk to MSMDate: Mon 2 Oct 2017Source: Pittsburgh Post Gazette, The Sand Diego Union-Tribune report [edited]<http://goo.gl/Facuie>Skate to where the puck is going, not to where it's been. Coined by Walter Gretzky, hockey immortal Wayne Gretzky's father, this well-worn adage is often referenced in business, but it also applies to San Diego's ongoing hepatitis A outbreak, said Robert Schooley, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at UC [University of California] San Diego School of Medicine.Hepatitis A outbreaks underway among gay men in many different cities show that it is not just homeless people and drug users who face significant risk from the disease, the physician said. ""So far, this population has not been affected in San Diego's outbreak, but we have seen big hep A outbreaks among (gay men) in Paris and New York and many other places,"" Schooley said.In an infectious disease context, the division chief added, Gretzky's quote perfectly encapsulates how public health departments should be thinking when a large outbreak is underway. Preventive efforts should not skate just to where the problem is at the moment but should also try to anticipate where the outbreak is headed.Given that recent epidemiological evidence shows that gay men are at a higher risk of hepatitis A infection than the general population, it would not be an unreasonable approach to double down on education and vaccination efforts in this demographic group, Schooley said. ""Ideally you want to get there before the 1st case hits, or shortly thereafter, to prevent the kind person-to-person spread we've seen in the homeless and drug-using population,"" Schooley said.The idea was already on the mind of Eric McDonald, director of the county's Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch. ""We're always worried about the possibility,"" McDonald said. ""Knowing that there are currently outbreaks in Colorado, New York City and Europe we know we don't want to see it cross over here in San Diego.""On 7 Jun 2017, the WHO issued a risk assessment that found an ""unusual increase in cases of hepatitis A"" among gay men in Europe and the Americas that had been underway from June 2016 through mid-May 2017. On 22 Sep 2017, the CDC issued a brief on an outbreak among gay men in New York that has now reached 51 patients. A health update issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment said on 5 Jul 2017 that an outbreak underway in 12 different cases, resulting in 43 confirmed cases. 15 of the 32 men who were infected had sex with other men. He said out of the 461 cases confirmed so far, only 8 gay men have had outbreak-linked hepatitis A infections. 2 were illicit drug users, 3 were both drug users and homeless, and 3 were part of neither group. Lesbian couples are considered less at risk than men due to fundamental differences in the nature of sexual contact.He said that, in addition to including men who have sex with men in the county's regular public communications about who's at risk in the current outbreak, McDonald said county health officials have also made presentations to organizations that serve the city's LGTBQ community. Collaboration is also underway, he added, with programs that regularly provide health care to gay men. ""One of the things we asked when we had our big meeting with all of the health care stakeholders was to look at their own records systems, discern which of their patients have the highest risk, and proactively ask them to come in and get vaccinated,"" McDonald said.The director said there are no current data available on exactly what proportion of gay men living in San Diego County have had a hepatitis A vaccination, though the fact that outbreaks have occurred in other places for many years now means that this group is generally better vaccinated than the general population.Family Health Centers of San Diego, which has long operated the region's largest health care programs for this demographic -- including a gay men's wellness program, a transgender clinic and the area's largest HIV clinic -- also regularly puts outreach teams on the streets in Hillcrest and other neighborhoods where the city's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender residents live and recreate. These teams have always included hepatitis A and B in the safe sex messages designed to prevent a range of transmittable infections with HIV at the top of the list, said Bob Lewis, the organization's director of special populations. Though the teams work in largely the same way they always have, approaching small groups of people in bars, clubs and city sidewalks, a hepatitis A flier was added early this summer [2017] as the outbreak grew.Family Health Centers was already offering hepatitis A vaccinations to any gay man who arrived in any of its medical offices, and that has been the case for many years, he said.""This has been a high-risk groups for hep A for a long time,"" Lewis said. He speculated that maybe the reason the outbreak has not yet appeared to any large degree among gay men is because vaccination efforts have been underway for many years. ""I think that's because there has been such consistent messaging about vaccination in this community,"" Jones said.Family Health, which offers a range of services to nearly 200 000 uninsured, low income and underserved patients each year, operates 21 clinics throughout San Diego and has screened 12 820 patients for hepatitis A since 14 Aug 2017, according to its chief executive Fran Butler-Cohen. Nearly 9000, she said, have received at least one shot and the interest in vaccination has picked up recently. ""We gave 1200 vaccine doses last week [week of 25 Sep 2017] alone,"" Butler-Cohen said.[Byline: Paul Sisson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)--------------------------------5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5)1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4)8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3.2)15 Aug 2017 / 333 / 232 (70) / 11 (3.3)22 Aug 2017 / 352 / 246 (70) / 14 (4)29 Aug 2017 / 378 / 263 (70) / 15 (4)5 Sep 2017 / 398 / 279 (70) / 15 (3.8)12 Sep 2017 / 421 / 292 (69) / 16 (3.8)19 Sep 2017 / 444 / 305 (69) / 16 (3.6)26 Sep 2017 / 461 / 315 (68) / 17 (3.7)3 Oct 2017 / 481 / 337 (70) / 17 (3.5)In the past week, 20 cases have been reported with no additional deaths. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published last August 2017 (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal 20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak is continuing at a relatively stable rate of about 15-20 new onset cases/week.The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the deaths occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM (men who have sex with men) practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. No decrease seems to be occurring in the weekly number of newly reported cases. I would venture to say that 16 deaths from hepatitis A is the most in any US state for many years, let alone in 5.5 months.The San Diego County government is now recommending hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers. The vaccine recommendation has also been expanded to those who work in health care in addition to prior recommendations for those who work in public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters and behavioral and homeless service providers. The county has also set up handwashing stations in high risk areas. Given an incubation period of 15-45 days with a mean of 28 days, the immunizations, as well as increased environmental cleaning and hand washing stations, will take several weeks or more to have an effect. - Mod.LLThe state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/787>.

On 29 Mar 2017, the Maricopa County Department of Public Health identified 3 confirmed HAV cases among homeless persons using services at one campus. We sought to determine outbreak source and scope and prevent further spread.Methods: Cases were defined as having symptoms of acute hepatitis and a positive IgM anti-HAV test in persons with a history of homelessness or exposure or epidemiologic link to the campus and onset in 2017. Case-finding included enhanced surveillance with outreach to campus staff and healthcare providers who serve homeless persons. In-person interviews were conducted with campus HAV vaccination clinic attendees on 4 and 11 Apr 2017. To assess factors associated with HAV infection, a case-control study was conducted; campus clients or staff without a HAV diagnosis were controls. An environmental inspection was conducted. CDC performed HAV molecular sequencing.Results: 12 cases were identified, one by facility reporting, 3 by healthcare reporting, and 8 by enhanced surveillance. Illness onsets were 15 Feb-27 Apr 2017; mean age was 47 years; 50 percent were male. The patient with the earliest onset arrived around 5 Feb 2017 from San Diego, California, an area with an ongoing HAV outbreak. No campus food safety concerns were identified; educational flyers, soap, and alcohol-based hand sanitizer were provided to the campus. HAV vaccine was administered to 221 (22 percent) of about 1000 clients and 105 (42 percent) of 250 staff who chose to attend the clinics. 10 cases and 343 controls were enrolled in the case-control study; not all questions were answered. Neither eating meals on campus (P equal to .71) nor sleeping on campus (P equal to .75) were associated with HAV. Fewer cases (57 percent) than controls (78 percent) reported always washing their hands before eating (P equal to .18). HAV isolated from 3 cases was molecularly identical to San Diego isolates.Conclusion: Molecular and epidemiologic data support that this HAV outbreak among homeless persons was associated with the San Diego outbreak. Crowding and suboptimal hygiene practices might have facilitated campus transmission. Expeditious vaccination might have slowed spread; surveillance is ongoing.[Authors: Iverson SA, Narang N, Garcia MJ, et al]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Several past posts have mentioned HAV in the homeless population in Arizona without quantitation.
