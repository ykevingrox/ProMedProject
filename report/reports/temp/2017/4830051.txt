Also the description of a ""violent"" ulcer for a generally painless condition does not seem consistent with the usual presentation of Buruli ulcer. It will be very useful to know more about this situation.--Pamela Small, PhD.Professor EmeritusMicrobiology DepartmentUniversity of Tennessee,Knoxville, TN, USA<psmall@utk.edu>[Dr Small is correct in that, although the mode of transmission to humans remains unknown, it is thought to involve contact with an environmental source, not to person-to-person spread; and the incubation period is thought to be prolonged. The incubation period, which has been estimated by interviewing patients who reported a defined period of contact with an endemic area in southeastern Australia prior to diagnosis, was found to be a mean of 135 days (range: 34-264 days) (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3789762/>).True ""outbreaks"" of Buruli ulcer in endemic regions, as in Africa, where contact with an environmental source is likely a daily occurrence, do not occur. A large number of patients diagnosed in a relatively short time, such as 1094 cases of Buruli ulcer registered on SÌ£o TomÌ© since October 2016 among a population of less than 200 000 inhabitants, is most likely due to increased recognition of the disease by clinicians, increased reporting, or enhanced case finding.However, outbreaks of Buruli ulcer have been described, mainly in focal areas, likely due to emergence of a new environmental source or increased contact with an existing environmental source. For example, Buruli ulcer developed in a community in southeastern Australia in 79 persons (48 residents and 31 visitors) from January 2002 through April 2007; _M. ulcerans_ infection was not found in the area before 2002 (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375796/>).The dramatic description of skin ulcers in the ProMED-mail report as ""violent"" and as skin lesions that ""torment the inhabitants of SÌ£o TomÌ©"" is inconsistent with the usual appearance of Buruli ulcer when first diagnosed in many patients. The WHO grades severity of Buruli ulcer into 3 categories: a single small lesion (category I), non-ulcerative and ulcerative plaque and edematous forms (category II), and disseminated and mixed forms such as osteitis, osteomyelitis, joint involvement (category III) (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs199/en/>). However, delayed diagnosis may lead to advanced forms of the disease and great disability, as may have happened in SÌ£o TomÌ©.Pictures of Buruli ulcers can be seen at (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCQ67NGmytI>).Nevertheless, more information on this outbreak in SÌ£o TomÌ© is needed -- a clear description of the skin lesions and the results of tests used to confirm the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer, that is, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), acid-fast staining, histopathology, and culture.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63>. - Mod.ML][See Also:Buruli ulcer - SÌ£o TomÌ© and PrÌ ncipe 20170208.4824961].................................................ml/mj/dk"
