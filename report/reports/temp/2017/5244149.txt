An active case search is ongoing, and the people at the village are being closely monitored. All individuals who came into contact with the deceased are being monitored on a daily basis,"" Katjivena stated.This is the 3rd case of the fever reported in Namibia this year [2017].In February 2017, a Gobabis farmworker (26) also died from Congo fever at the Gobabis District Hospital.The unidentified man died 2 days later after being admitted to hospital after he vomited blood. He was treated for fever, diarrhoea, and coughing a few days before his hospitalisation after being bitten by a tick.Following the man's death, a 2nd case of Congo fever was also reported in the Omaheke region, when a 19-year-old male from the Okongoua village was also bitten by a tick. The teenager survived after spending days in isolation.A person with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever can have sudden on-set of high fever, headache, back pain, joint pain, abdominal pain, dizziness (feeling like you are losing your balance and about to fall), neck pain and stiffness, bleeding, bruising, or a rash.The sick person would have been in contact with a person who has similar symptoms or animals infested with ticks, or would have had a tick bite.The person may also have nausea, vomiting, a sore throat and mood swings.[Byline: Nomhle Kangootui]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) spreads to humans either by tick-bites or through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter.CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat for public health services because of epidemic potential, high case fatality ratios (10-40 percent), potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and difficulties in treatment and prevention. CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and in Asia south of the 50th parallel north, the geographic limit of the genus _Hyalomma_, the principal tick vector <http://www.who.int/csr/disease/crimean_congoHF/en/>.It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.There are no vaccines available for use in animals.Although an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions.Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.Recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4006>.]
