Economia y Negocios [In Spanish, translated & edited by Mod.JG]<http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=405233> Between 2010 and 2015, cases [Chagas disease] have almost doubled, especially among immigrants from Bolivia. Calama is the area that has notified most of the cases.The rise in the number of persons living in the coast in Antofagasta, because of the massive collection of sea resources, such as the huiro (a certain type of seaweed), has increased the risk for potential transmission of Chagas' disease, a non-curable and potentially lethal condition.Being bitten by a 'vinchuca' (a triatomine bug), which is endemic in the northern part of Chile, leads to the transmission of the disease. The vector gets the parasite after eating a blood meal from a mammal previously infected with the _Trypanosoma cruzi_ parasite.Both researchers and health care authorities are quite concerned because of the massive increase in precarious settlings in which people working in seaweed collection live in the coast of the 2nd Region. This region is the natural habitat of one 'vinchuca' species, and it is near stools from seaside birds or mammals. ""When the coast, where there is an endemic triatomine, becomes populated by people working in seaweed extraction, there is evidently a greater likelihood for becoming exposed"", said Mr. Zamir Nayar, Head of the Antofagasta Health Service.This situation has brought an increase in the number of cases (of Chagas' disease), from 109 in 2010 to 212 in 2015, and the reports in migrants rocketed from 4 to 121 cases during the same period, according to a report from the local Ministry of Health office.""This coastal triatomine is less likely to transmit the disease compared to triatomines from the highlands, but we should not consider that it is not capable of transmitting the disease"", said Carlos Guerra, Biology PhD from the Antofagasta University.[Claudio Cerda Santander]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Bolivia is highly endemic for Chagas disease. It is therefore very likely that the Bolivian migrant workers were infected before coming to Chile. This could be investigated by testing newly migrated workers for Chagas using serology. Also studying the local triatomid bugs for trypanosomes would help elucidate the situation. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>.]
