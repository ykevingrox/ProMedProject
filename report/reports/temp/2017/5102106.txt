NBC 7 San Diego [edited]<http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Fourth-Death-Related-to-Hepatitis-A-Outbreak-Reported-in-San-Diego-County-428058443.html>A 4th person has died as a result of a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) said Mon 12 Jun 2017. Since the outbreak, 120 people have been hospitalized and there have been 160 total cases of the virus in the county. According to the HHSA, the outbreak has not been linked to a common food, drink or drug source. But many of the individuals who became sick from the virus are homeless and/or used illegal drugs.There were 12 reported cases of the virus in county detention facilities. The following is a list of possible exposures.- George Bailey Detention Facility:Area 1A: from [10-24 Apr 2017]Area 2A: from [17 May-5 Jun 2017]Area 3A: on [24 Apr 2017]Area 3C: from [24 Apr-1 May 2017], on [5 May 2017], and from [15-18 May 2017]- San Diego Central JailArea 4A: from [8-10 May 2017]Area 7B: from [24 Apr-26 May 2017]Area 8C: from [24 Apr-7 May 2017]- East Mesa Detention Facility from [6-8 May 2017]Anyone who may have been exposed to the virus can develop symptoms up to 50 days after the exposure. ""We strongly encourage people who are at risk to check with their healthcare providers and get vaccinated for hepatitis A,"" said public health officer Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH.The virus can be prevented if a vaccine is received within 2 weeks of the exposure, according to the HHSA.Those most at risk for getting hepatitis A are those in the homeless community, illegal drug users, and people with chronic liver diseases. The vaccine is also recommended for anyone who frequently works with homeless people and/or illegal drug users. Hepatitis A can also be spread by having sexual contact or sharing drugs with someone who is infected.Symptoms of hepatitis A include: jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and light-colored stools. Hepatitis A can sometimes cause liver failure and even death.[Byline: Jaspreet Kaur]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase, now over a 6.5 month period.Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)--------------------------------------------------------------5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)There have been 80 more cases over about 6 weeks and 121 more cases over 10 weeks. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to been significantly higher.It remains unclear if the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. An epidemiologic curve showing dates of onset over time would be useful in sorting out the possibilities. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear if the fatalities occurred in those individuals.Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors while homosexual practices is not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. - Mod.LLThe state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/787>.
