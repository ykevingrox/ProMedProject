According to the chief nurse of the Mulondo health centre, JoÌ£o Pintal GonÌ¤alves, the vaccination campaign covered adults and children, representing 82 percent of the predicted target.Yellow fever is a dangerous infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The yellow ever (YF) outbreak, which was 1st detected in Angola in December 2015, caused 965 confirmed cases across the 2 countries, with thousands more cases suspected. The last case detected in Angola was on 23 June 2016. Huila province was a very early site at the beginning of the YF outbreak in Angola. It seems likely that this province was included in the massive YF vaccination campaigns carried out in Angola. There is no indication in the above report that the current vaccination campaign is in response to concern about new cases or of potential spill-over from the sylvan (forest) endemic transmission cycle of YF virus. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Angola can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/165>A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32978>.]
