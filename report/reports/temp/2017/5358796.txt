Silver Times [edited]<https://sivertimes.com/measles-405-case-in-france-since-the-beginning-of-the-year/70769>Between January and July [2017], more than 400 people have been infected [with measles]. In particular, an outbreak occurred in the month of May 2017. This increased the alarm of public health in France. In the past year [2016], only 79 cases had been identified.It must be said that measles is active and virulent. In total, 168 patients were hospitalized because of the infection, most often for severe pneumonia. Evidence that the virus does not distinguish between its victims, a 16 year-old girl died of severe complications in July 2017. She was non-vaccinated; however, she had no previous medical history.Most of the time, these are young children who bear the brunt of the infection. Infants under 1 year and children 1-4 years of age are among the main reported cases; next, adolescents 15-19 years.Kindergartens, schools and universities are among the privileged places of measles transmission. Public Health France considers it necessary to prepare for an outbreak. ""The current epidemiology of measles shows that France is still endemic and is not immune to a new outbreak of significant [size]."" In fact, the [cases] are distributed rather evenly in the territory.The scenario of an epidemic is all the more credible because the immunization coverage is so low. Only 79 percent of babies 2 years old are vaccinated. It would be necessary to reach 95 percent in order to prevent any movement of the virus.In the light of these indicators, public Health France recommends that healthcare professionals be vigilant. If the [vaccine series] is incomplete, a vaccination catch-up or post-exposure prophylaxis will prevent the spread of the virus.The goal: prevent an epidemic like that of 2011 [see figure showing number of case yearly in report at URL]. In the space of a year, more than 15 000 people had been infected; 10 deaths were recorded.France is [not alone] in the face of this resurgence of measles. Our neighbours -- Italians, Belgians and Germans -- have been faced with a sudden increase in cases. Because of this, Italy has chosen to re-establish the vaccination requirement. Further to the east, Romania must also combat an outbreak that is very active.--Communicated by: ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of France can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>] ******[2] GreeceDate: Thu 28 Sep 2017Source: Greek Reporter [edited]<http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/09/28/authorities-on-alert-over-measles-outbreak-says-health-minister-xanthos/>""We are not complacent; we are on alert and we are following the instructions given by the National Vaccination Committee based on the changing map of the measles epidemic in Greece and Europe,"" Health Minister Andreas Xanthos stated to Athens Macedonian News Agency radio station ""Praktoreio 104.9FM"" on Thu [28 Sep 2017], regarding the measles outbreak in Greece.He said that approximately 170 cases have been recorded so far in Greece but ""fortunately none of them had either serious complications or were fatal"". It was positive that a greater awareness to the benefits of vaccination had developed in Greek public opinion during this period, he added.Scientists consider that the outbreak of measles was largely the result of the anti-vaccination movement. Fortunately, these movements do not yet have a strong influence in Greece, said Xanthos, noting that immunization coverage in Greece corresponds to 96 percent of the general population, a percentage that is among the highest in Europe.The cases recorded so far in Greece concerned mostly populations of Roma children under 10 years old, Xanthos said, adding that a Centre for Disease Control and Prevention unit has already vaccinated 1500 children in Roma camps in the Attica region.Xanthos clarified that there were no measles cases in any refugee camp because ""the children in all refugee camps were vaccinated in early 2016"".[Byline: A.

The vaccine, which combines protection from measles, mumps and rubella -- German measles -- in a single injection, is a vital part of child immunization strategy and has helped reduce yearly measles deaths to single digits.However, during the 90s, the MMR vaccine was subject to a widespread smear campaign. Public distrust was further exacerbated by the now highly discredited Andrew Wakefield and his 1998 paper that drew links between MMR and both autism and a type of bowel disease.After review by several independent bodies, that work was found to draw conclusions that are not supported by credible research. Additional studies have shown no link between MMR and autism, and no wider association exists between vaccinations and increased autism risk.Nevertheless, the Wakefield scandal caused a noticeable dip in MMR vaccination rates as the general public, understandably, expressed concern.As a result, health experts have hailed this moment as an overdue but welcome victory for child health.Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at Public Health England, tells the BBC:""This is a huge achievement and a testament to all the hard work by our health professionals in the NHS to ensure that all children and adults are fully protected with two doses of the MMR vaccine. We need to ensure that this is sustained going forward by maintaining and improving coverage of the MMR vaccine in children and by catching up older children and young adults who missed out.As with any formal classification, there are some important caveats to keep in mind.When we discuss elimination in the sense of wiping out a disease from circulation, it doesn't mean that there won't be isolated cases of infection. The classification simply signifies that measles is no longer circulating in the general population in a way that constitutes an overt public health risk.Indeed, the BBC notes that there were around 500 cases of measles officially recorded in 2016. Herd immunity can protect those isolated cases from becoming a national problem, and that's why reaching elimination stage with over 90 percent vaccination rates is so important.This highlights the other important aspect of this classification: Elimination does not mean that this trend cannot be reversed.If parents stop getting their children vaccinated, we could easily see a resurgence in measles, similar to that which has occurred in the US and other areas of Europe. In fact, anti-vaccination campaigns have manipulated perceptions of vaccine safety across the world.With those facts in mind, the WHO's announcement carries with it an extra cause for celebration. Now, 42 out of 53 countries within Europe's bounds have now eliminated measles. This brings us within sight of achieving total elimination and consigning measles, as well as its disfiguring and deadly effects, to the past.""[Byline: Steve Williams]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is very encouraging news, especially amidst all the reports of measles in populations that are avoiding the MMR vaccine for unwarranted fear of adverse effects. With 42 out of 53 countries in Europe having achieved elimination of measles, total elimination appears possible in the continent, but vigilance will continue to need to be maintained because of measles outbreaks elsewhere in Europe, including Italy, Belgium, France, and Germany. Nonetheless, this exciting news of measles elimination in the UK should give pause to anti-vaxxers. - Mod.LK][A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the United Kingdom can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>.]******[4] PakistanDate: Sat 30 Sep 2017 Source: Daily Times [edited]<http://dailytimes.com.pk/pakistan/30-Sep-17/measles-outbreak-claims-lives-of-12-children>At least 20 children have fallen prey to a measles outbreak in Mithoo Jogi and adjoining areas of Kunri taluka during the past 20 days. People of the areas have demanded the Sindh Health Department and authorities concerned to launch a comprehensive vaccination drive to cope with the situation.They also demanded an action against health officials for their alleged failure to start the vaccination drive.According to details, 9 children in Mithoo Gypsy settlement near Sabhri village of Kunri taluka and 11 children in other parts of the district have lost lives due to the outbreak.Following the deaths, the Health Department has established 3-day camps in affected areas, while severe ailing kids have been shifted to Civil Hospital Umerkot.Dr Ali Nawaz Shahani, a senior retired medical practitioner in Umerkot, said patients should be provided supplementary treatment to maintain their immune power. ""In case of failure, secondary infections such as pneumonia and high-grade fever could kill affected children,"" he warned.He said that a comprehensive vaccination drive should be launched in villages, while ailing children should be kept in isolation to save others. He feared that reasons behind deaths might be traditional healing methods.Sindh Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) Additional Project Director Dr Zulfiqar Abro said that disease was spread by droplet infection, and the areas where vaccination cover was low or poor were more prone to it. He vowed stern action against those responsible in this regard. Umerkot District Health Officer Karmoon Mal had confirmed 6 deaths and confessed that the Health Department had not vaccinated children properly.[Byline: Sanjay Mathrani]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Pakistan can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.]******[5] VenezuelaDate: Sat 30 Sep 2017 Source: Malay Mail Online [edited]<http://www.themalaymailonline.com/features/article/one-million-unvaccinated-venezuelan-kids-vulnerable-in-measles-outbreak-say#KcgeBD4rKZvyULXg.97>Around 1 million unvaccinated Venezuelan children are susceptible to measles, a highly contagious disease that has re-emerged in the crisis-stricken South American nation, a group of doctors estimated yesterday [29 Sep 2017].A crippling shortage of medicines and vaccines, as well as decaying hospitals and an exodus of doctors has thrown Venezuela's health sector into a tailspin.Amid the crisis, once-controlled diseases like diphtheria and measles have returned to the fore, putting Venezuela's 30 million people at risk and raising the threat of contagion beyond its borders.Measles, caused by a virus usually passed through direct contact and the air, is a top cause of death for young children, although a vaccine is available. The World Health Organisation warns it can be especially lethal in countries that have suffered violent conflict and whose health infrastructure is deteriorated.Venezuelan health associations 1st raised the alarm about the return of measles in the rough southern mining state of Bolivar in August [2017]. Since then, the WHO has reported 84 suspected cases, with 34 confirmed cases.""Preliminary data indicates it is evolving rapidly,"" 2 Venezuelan public health organisations said of the measles outbreak in a report yesterday [29 Sep 2017].""We've identified a suboptimal vaccination coverage, and on a national level we estimate that at least 1 150 000 children under the age of 1 were not vaccinated...over the last 10 years,"" the report added.Ana Carvajal, a doctor and one of the authors of the report, told Reuters the estimate is based on data obtained through sources at the Health Ministry and WHO figures.Still, an ongoing vaccination drive in Bolivar has likely lowered the risk.The WHO has said it is helping with the purchase and delivery of some 7.2 million vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in Venezuela and hopes to spread the drive across the country.As Venezuela's medical crisis has worsened, the Health Ministry has largely kept mum and no longer publishes a weekly bulletin that includes data on infant mortality or mosquito-borne diseases like malaria.The government did not respond to a request for comment on this story.Measles deaths dropped around 79 per cent between 2000 and 2015 globally thanks to vaccinations, according to the WHO.But gaps in coverage have led to several measles outbreaks in Europe in the past year, officials said in April 2017, with lack of trust leading people to turn down potentially life-saving vaccines. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Venezuela is suffering a crisis in public health. According to the most recent National Survey of Hospitals, 97 percent of services provided by hospitals are faulty, 75 percent of hospitals suffer from scarcity of medical supplies, and 63 percent reported problems with their water system.
