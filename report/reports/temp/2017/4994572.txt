Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) [edited]<http://www.msf.org/en/article/ethiopia-thousands-hit-outbreak-acute-watery-diarrhea-during-worst-drought-decades>An important outbreak of acute watery diarrhea is sweeping through Doolo zone, in Ethiopia's Somali region, exacerbated by one of the worst droughts in 30 years. In response, teams from Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) are working alongside Ethiopian health authorities to bring the outbreak under control, while warning that more external funding and resources are urgently needed to stop the disease from spreading further.Officially declared on [7 Apr 2017], the outbreak has affected more than 16 000 people in the whole region since the start of 2017, with about 3500 new cases per month, according to local authorities. The government has so far deployed over 1200 health professionals, including nurses and doctors, and set up 100 centres to treat people with the disease. Even if an overall decline in acute watery diarrhea numbers is registered in the region, the risk of re-infection remains high. Despite all efforts, MSF teams working in some of worst affected locations in Doolo zone of the Somali region say that there are still serious shortages of infrastructure å  such as boreholes, pumps, trucks to transport water, and storage tanks for safe drinking water å  and a lack of international organizations responding to the emergency. People in this region, mostly nomadic, generally take advantage of the rainy season to store water for the rest of the year. But little rain has fallen in the past 2 seasons, resulting in a severe drought, with people in many locations currently surviving on less than 2 liters of water per day. Without sufficient clean water, many have been forced to use untreated water sources, often resulting in the spread of acute watery diarrhea.For health staff, treating patients for acute watery diarrhea without sufficient supplies of water is a major challenge. Many health centres have been overwhelmed by the suddenness of the outbreak. MSF has worked alongside its partners to strengthen the support to the government's health centers, as well as to increase the rapid response to temporary sites during outbreaks. The outbreak is the latest in a series of crises brought on by the drought, which has already caused the cost of food to rise sharply and large numbers of people, women and children in particular, to travel in search of water to keep themselves and their remaining livestock alive.""All of our animals died,"" is commonly heard throughout many of the numerous informal settlement camps. One woman, whose child recovered from severe malnutrition after being treated at MSF's inpatient therapeutic feeding centre in Wardher, told a similar tale: ""Before, we moved around with our animals. But our last camel has just died, and now we have to settle closer to a place where we can find a remaining source of water.""These camps are scattered throughout the zone and make a rapid response more challenging. Some 5.7 million people are in need of food aid in Ethiopia, according to the UN. Before the current outbreak was declared, MSF and the Ethiopian government had already reported an alarming increase in the number of children suffering from severe malnutrition in Doolo zone. In the first 3 months of 2017 alone, MSF teams in Doolo zone treated 2352 patients for severe acute malnutrition in MSF supported centers, compared to 1230 in the whole of 2016. Severe acute malnutrition is life-threatening, particularly for young children. MSF teams treating people - together with the health authorities - for acute watery diarrhea in Geladi and Danod have seen large numbers of children under 5 [years of age] with clear signs of malnutrition.""Drought, malnutrition, and disease are a lethal combination,"" says Oliver Schulz, MSF's head of mission in Ethiopia. ""More help is urgently needed to provide clean water, infrastructure, and funding. Unless this happens soon, many more lives will be at risk.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera -  Sudan (White Nile state)Date: Mon 24 Apr 2017Source: All Africa, a Radio Dabanga (Amsterdam) report [edited] <http://allafrica.com/stories/201704240905.html>A woman died of cholera in Um Jar locality in White Nile state on [Sun 23 Apr 2017]. Medical sources told Radio Dabanga that a woman, a cholera patient, died at the Kateer Balla Health Centre. The health centers of Andalus, Kateer Balla, Arafa, and Um Jar town received 40 new cases in total on [Sat 22 Apr 2017]. The Um Jar Hospital admitted 13 new cases on [Fri 21 Apr 2017].In the 20 villages in the area of Um Jar, located between Ad Duwaym and Rabak, at least 200 people are afflicted as well. According to the sources, Unicef has sent medical equipment, vaccines and medicines to the Um Jar Hospital, together with a team to conduct a field survey.On [Fri 21 Apr 2017], a coordinator at the Um Jar Health Centre told Radio Dabanga that about 900 people in Um Jar locality are stricken by 'watery diarrhea'.Since September 2016, people in eastern, central, and northern Sudan reported cases of 'watery diarrhea'. Medics have confirmed that the disease concerns cholera. The Sudanese authorities however, have instructed all medics and health workers to mention watery diarrhea only. Earlier this month [April 2017], a journalist was detained in El Gedaref in eastern Sudan for reporting about cholera. ""It seems a stigma for the government,"" a UK-based Sudanese epidemiology specialist told this station in January 2017. He feared that the silence by the authorities will turn into a long-lasting outbreak of cholera cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - Eritrea (Anseba region)Date: Sat 22 Apr 2017Source: Adoulis [in Arabic, trans. Mod.MM, edited]<http://www.adoulis.net/entry.php?id=5375>A total of 3 prisoners have died from severe diarrhea and more than 21 other inmates are suffering from the same symptoms in what could be a cholera outbreak at Hashferai detention camp near Hagat town. The cholera suspects have been referred to Glas military hospital for further management.--Communicated by:ProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[Hagat (Hagaz) is a town in central Eritrea. Located in the Anseba region, it is the capital of Hagaz District and can be found on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagaz>.Contaminated water remains the major risk factor for the acquisition of _V. cholerae_. As reported in Africa (currently in the Horn of Africa) periods of flooding and drought increase the risk of outbreaks. As demonstrated in Haiti the introduction of cholera into a country with a destroyed sanitary system and no underlying immunity can cause a major epidemic. In the classical endemic areas such as the Indian subcontinent and other areas in Asia, rainy reasons often accentuate the number of cases. Acute watery diarrhea is often used as an alternative term for cholera, the primary cause of outbreaks of watery diarrhea with fatalities in adults. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/95>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/94>.]
