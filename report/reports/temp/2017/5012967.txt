UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/WCA%20Cholera_Update_W14.pdf>The El NiÌ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climate patterns can have profound impacts on the occurrence of infectious diseases ranging from dengue to cholera.In Africa, El NiÌ±o conditions are associated with increased rainfall in East Africa and decreased rainfall in southern Africa, West Africa, and parts of the Sahel [zone of transition between the Sahara to the north and the Sudanian Savanna to the south]. Because of the key role of water supplies in cholera transmission, a relationship between El NiÌ±o events and cholera incidence is highly plausible, and previous research has shown a link between ENSO patterns and cholera in Bangladesh.However, there is little systematic evidence for this link in Africa. Using high resolution mapping techniques, we find that the annual geographic distribution of cholera in Africa from 2000 to 2014 changes dramatically, with the burden shifting to continental East Africa -- and away from Madagascar and portions of Southern, Central, and West Africa -- where almost 50 000 additional cases occur during El NiÌ±o years.Cholera incidence during El NiÌ±o years was higher in regions of East Africa with increased rainfall, but incidence was also higher in some areas with decreased rainfall, suggesting a complex relationship between rainfall and cholera incidence [see reference below].Cholera outbreaks in Central and West Africa: 2017 regional update -- week 14 [1 Jan-7 Apr 2017]---------------------------------------------------------------------[Only countries with cases in 2016 or 2017 are included - Mod.LL]Country / Total suspected 2017 / Deaths / CFR* / EW 1-14** Cases 2016 / Total 2016---------------------------------------------------------------------Benin / 0 / 0 / -- / 86 / 874Cameroon / 17 / 0 / -- / 0 / 78Central African Rep / 0 / 0 / -- / 0 / 265Congo / 0 / 0 / -- / 0 / 18Congo DR / 8743 / 308 / 3.5 / 7315 / 28 170Cote d'Ivoire / 16 / 0 / -- / 1 / 16Ghana / 8 / 0 / -- / 1 / 740Liberia / 39 / 4 / 10.3 / 110 / 155Nigeria / 46 / 4 / 8.7/ 194 / 768Sierra Leone / 2 / 0 / -- / 0 / 2Total 8871 / 316 / 3.6 per cent / 7707 / 31 124* case fatality rate, expressed in percentages** epidemiological weeks 1-14: 1 Jan-8 Apr 2016--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[reference----------Moore SM, Azman AS, Zaitchik BF, et al.

The launch was attended by the president of South West State HE Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, Somalia's minister of health and social services HE Dr Fawziya Abikar, WHO representative for Somalia Dr Ghulam Popal, and state minister of health Issak Ali Subag along with the community, local leaders, and representative of UN and NGO partners.The vaccination campaign is in response to a major cholera outbreak in Somalia that began in January 2017. Since the beginning of the year, a total of 31 674 cases and 618 deaths have been reported in Somalia. Of these, 18 608 cases and 415 deaths have been reported in the South West State, which is nearly 60 per cent of all AWD [acute watery diarrhea]/cholera cases reported in the country.The start of the rainy season has brought some respite to the community where clean water sources are scare, however, the effects of the drought in Somalia have had its harsh impact. Lack of access to clean water and hygiene, food insecurity and malnutrition caused by drought have increased cases of cholera in the area.The vaccination campaign is conducted in 2 rounds and will conclude before the start of Ramadan [Fri 26 May 2017]. The cholera vaccine does not replace traditional preventative measures such as access to clean water and safe hygiene practises. Supplementing the cholera vaccine, water treatment tablets were distributed to the community during the campaign by the WASH cluster [Global Water Sanitation and Hygiene Cluster].HE Dr Fawziya Abikar thanked WHO for supporting the Ministry of Health in introducing oral cholera vaccines in the country. ""This is an important step to prevent the further spread of cholera and we are thankful to WHO and partners for their continued support in containing this outbreak,"" she said.The OCV campaign in Baidoa follows a successful vaccination campaign that was implemented in 7 high-risk districts in Banadir, Hiraan, and Lower Jubba regions. A concurrent vaccination campaign has also started in Jowhar in Middle Shebelle region this week, targeting 239 000 vulnerable persons aged 1 year and above.Dr Ghulam Popal reiterated WHO's commitment to support cholera response efforts across the country. ""We are working with health authorities at all levels and humanitarian partners to limit this outbreak,"" he said.The vaccination campaigns are supported by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, GAVI the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, Sweden, and health partners in its various stages of planning and implementation. WHO is also engaged in planning, organization, and monitoring of the campaigns.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Somalia can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/somalia.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/17540 >. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJPart of the future prevention of cholera in the developing world is cholera vaccine. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera, in Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).References----------57. Luquero FJ, Grout L, Ciglenecki I, et al.
