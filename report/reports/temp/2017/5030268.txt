KSBY [edited]<http://www.ksby.com/story/35400661/slo-county-resident-dies-of-valley-fever-5th-victim-this-year>San Luis Obispo [SLO] County [California] Public Health Services says one person in the county has recently died from valley fever [coccidioidomycosis]. His death marks the 5th valley fever death so far this year in SLO County.Health officials say 47 cases of valley fever were reported in the 1st 4 months of the year [2017] and 11 additional cases are under investigation.Cases of valley fever reported to the public health department from [1 Jan to 30 Apr 2017] have risen in recent years: 2015 - 18 cases; 2016 - 49 cases; [and] 2017: 47 cases (plus 11 additional cases under investigation). Health officials say valley fever is expected to spike this year.The fungus that causes valley fever lives naturally in the soil in SLO County, health officials say. When this soil is disturbed -- by wind, construction, or other causes -- people can breathe in the spores of this fungus and develop valley fever, according to the County of SLO Health Agency. The rainfall we've experienced this year may have contributed to the problem. Now that the soil is drying and the wind is picking up, experts say the spores are more likely to become airborne.There have been no valley fever deaths in Santa Barbara County this year [2017]. Health officials there say there have been 13 confirmed cases as of [1 Apr 2017].[Byline: Matt Van Slyke]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Coccidioidomycosis is due to inhalation of spores of _Coccidioides immitis_, a soil organism, that have become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. The California counties of Kern, Kings, Tulare, Fresno, Madera, and San Luis Obispo are the coccidioidomycosis-endemic California areas; these counties had the highest annual average incidence rates for coccidioidomycosis, and their cumulative cases represent 76 per cent of all cases reported from California for years 2001-2009 (see Figure 9 at Hector RF, et al: The public health impact of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California.
