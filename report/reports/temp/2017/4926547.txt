The cases were 5 cases from Guangxi, 4 cases in Hunan, 2 cases each from Hubei and Zhejiang, and one case each from Anhui, Fujian, Guizhou, Henan, and Jiangxi. Among them, 16 were known to have exposure to poultry or poultry markets.According to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP), as of [18 Mar 2017], 1329 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported since 2013.Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks, according to the CHP. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death.People mainly become infected with avian influenza through close contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings. Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian flu. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Guangxi updateDate: Sat 25 Mar 2017Source: Global Times, Xinhua News Agency report [edited]<http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1039459.shtml>The number of H7N9 infection cases in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has risen to 20 in 2017, including 7 fatalities, local authorities said [Fri 24 Mar 2017].
