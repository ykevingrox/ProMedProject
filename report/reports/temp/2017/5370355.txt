Al-Arabi News [in Arabic, machine transl. edited]<http://bit.ly/2y2Hq3y>Somali migrants have confirmed the deaths of 18 of them as a result of the cholera epidemic after drinking contaminated water in Djibouti during their voyage across the sea to Yemen and from there to Saudi Arabia. Local sources told Al-Arabi that more than 22 Somali refugees with cholera were admitted in the Ibn Khaldun hospital in the city of Al-Houta, the capital of Lahj province. They were taken from the coast of Ras Al-Ara, where they arrived a few days ago from Somali ports. Pediatricians at Ibn Khaldun Hospital reported that the migrants had been taken to the center for treatment and many of them had died during their trip with cholera.According to the International Organization for Migration in Aden, the arrival of about 120 illegal immigrants to the coast of Yemen through smugglers to transport them to Saudi Arabia by road. The United Nations announced on Thu 5 Oct 2017, that thousands of Somalis had begun to leave Yemen and return to their country because of the continuing conflict in the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, malnutrition and cholera outbreaks. ""About 10 000 Somalis, out of tens of thousands more, are now trying to leave for Somalia on a 16-18 hour flight,"" said UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Manto.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>viaProMED-MENA<promed-mena@promedmail.org>[This cases appear to have been introduced into Yemen in Somalis acquiring the _Vibrio cholerae_ infection in Djibouti.

Her mother, then 9 months pregnant, was brought into a crowded clinic in the Western port city of Hodeidah by her husband, who had to borrow the travel fare from a neighbor. ""My stomach started hurting more and more,"" said the 37 year old, a hydrating drip hooked into her arm.Once there, she was referred by a nurse for an ultrasound scan which showed her baby had died of dehydration -- one of 15 to perish in the womb due to cholera in September and October 2017, according to doctors at the city's Thawra hospital.""I felt like death,"" she said, her voice strained. ""Thank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn't stopped.""2.5 years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant, and the young are most vulnerable.The cholera ward is full of children -- some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing. Save the Children said in August 2017 that children under 15 represent nearly 1/2 of new cases and 1/3 of deaths, with malnourished children more than 6 times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones.Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness.[Byline: Abduljabbar Zeyad]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Intrauterine deaths caused by cholera infection seem to be due to dehydration of the mother causing dehydration _in utero_. For those interested in more information, the following are publications regarding cholera and pregnancy:1. Diop SA, Manga NM, Dia NM, et al. Cholera and pregnancy: epidemiological, clinical, and evolutionary aspects [in French]. Med Mal Infect. 2007; 37(12): 816-20.Abstract--------Objectives: This descriptive study had for objective to describe the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic, and evolutionary aspects of the association cholera and pregnancy during the cholera epidemic in Senegal in 2004 and 2005.Material and method: We analyzed the files of pregnant women admitted in the infectious diseases department of the Fann national University Hospital for suspicion of cholera, from 11 Oct 2004 to 31 Dec 2005.Results: 52 pregnant women were hospitalized and accounted for 1.76 percent of the patients admitted for cholera in the department. They were an average of 24+/-4.9 years of age and came from the Dakar suburbs in 60 percent of cases. The source of contagion was food and/or water in 70 percent of cases. These patients contracted the disease during the summer term of the pregnancy in 31 percent of cases. Clinically, they presented with a typical choleriform syndrome in 90 percent of cases, emesis in 100 percent of cases, and severe dehydration in 27 percent of cases. The coproculture for 14 women was positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ in 12 cases. For treatment, these patients benefited from intravenous rehydration in 75 percent of cases and antimicrobial therapy with doxycycline 300 mg in unidose. The following complications were noted: 6 abortions, 2 premature childbirths, and a maternal death.Conclusion: The association cholera and pregnancy presents high risks for the fetus and for the mother, requiring a fast and adequate management.2.

Med Sante Trop. 2016; 26(2): 199-202; doi: 10.1684/mst.2016.0554.Abstract--------Cholera is an epidemic diarrheal disease transmitted through the digestive tract; it can cause obstetric complications in pregnant women. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of cholera in pregnant women, as well as its course, during the 2012 epidemic in Conakry. This retrospective, descriptive study examined the records of this epidemic over a 7-month period (from 15 May 2012 to 15 Dec 2012). Of 2808 cholera patients at our hospital, 80 were pregnant, that is, 2.85 percent. Their mean age was 30 years [range: 15-45 years], 94 percent were from Conakry (94 percent), and 69 percent were in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Choleriform diarrhea and vomiting were the main signs, found respectively in 100 percent and 95 percent of the women; dehydration was mild for 16 percent, moderate for 45 percent, and severe for 39 percent. Support consisted of rehydration, by plans A (16 percent), B (45 percent), or C (39 percent) and antimicrobial treatment based on erythromycin (85 percent), doxycycline (14 percent), or azithromycin (1 percent). Other drugs that were used included phloroglucinol-trimethylphloroglucinol (Spasfon(å¨)) for 45 percent, acetaminophen for 65 percent, and iron/folic acid for 1 percent of cases. The major obstetric complications were 4 intrauterine deaths (5 percent), 2 cases of threatened abortion (2 percent), 1 preterm delivery (1 percent), and 1 maternal death. The cholera outbreak in 2012 affected a large number of pregnant women in Conakry, most during their 3rd trimester. The classic clinical manifestations were associated with obstetric complications and maternal-fetal risks.3. Tran NT, Taylor R, Antierens A, Staderini N. Cholera in pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of fetal, neonatal, and maternal mortality. PLoS One. 2015; 10(7): e0132920. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0132920. eCollection 2015.Abstract--------Background: Maternal infection with cholera may negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this research is to systematically review the literature and determine the risk of fetal, neonatal and maternal death associated with cholera during pregnancy.Materials and methods: Medline, Global Health Library, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the key terms cholera and pregnancy for articles published in any language and at any time before August 2013 to quantitatively summarize estimates of fetal, maternal, and neonatal mortality. 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each selected study. Random-effect non-linear logistic regression was used to calculate pooled rates and 95 percent CIs by time period. Studies from the recent period (1991-2013) were compared with studies from 1969-1990. Relative risk (RR) estimates and 95 percent CIs were obtained by comparing mortality of selected recent studies with published national normative data from the closest year.Results: The meta-analysis included 7 studies that together involved 737 pregnant women with cholera from 6 countries. The pooled fetal death rate for 4 studies during 1991-2013 was 7.9 percentage (95 percentage CIs 5.3-10.4), significantly lower than that of 3 studies from 1969-1990 (31.0 percentage, 95 percentage CIs 25.2-36.8). There was no difference in fetal death rate by trimester. The pooled neonatal death rate for 1991-2013 studies was 0.8 percentage (95 percentage CIs 0.0-1.6), and 6.4 percentage (95 percentage CIs 0.0-20.8) for 1969-1990. The pooled maternal death rate for 1991-2013 studies was 0.2 percentage (95 percentage CIs 0.0-0.7), and 5.0 percentage (95 percentage CIs 0.0-16.0) for 1969-1990. Compared with published national mortality estimates, the RR for fetal death of 5.8 (95 percentage CIs 2.9-11.3) was calculated for Haiti (2013), 1.8 (95 percentage CIs 0.3-10.4) for Senegal (2007), and 2.6 (95 percentage CIs 0.5-14.9) for Peru (1991); there were no significant differences in the RR for neonatal or maternal death.Conclusion: Results are limited by the inconsistencies found across included studies but suggest that maternal cholera is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly fetal death. These findings can inform a research agenda on cholera in pregnancy and guidance for the timely management of pregnant women with cholera.4. Ciglenecki I, Bichet M, Tena J, et al. Cholera in pregnancy: outcomes from a specialized cholera treatment unit for pregnant women in LÌ©ogÌ¢ne, Haiti. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2013; 7(8): e2368. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002368. eCollection 2013.Abstract--------Background: The association between cholera in pregnancy and negative fetal outcome has been described since the 19th century. However, there is limited published literature on the subject. We describe pregnancy outcomes from a specialized multidisciplinary hospital unit at the onset of a large cholera outbreak in Haiti in 2010 and 2011.Methods: Pregnant women with cholera were hospitalized in a specialized unit within the MSF hospital compound in LÌ©ogÌ¢ne and treated using standard cholera treatment guidelines but with earlier, more intense fluid replacement. All women had intravenous access established at admission regardless of their hydration status, and all received antibiotic treatment. Data were collected on patient demographics, pregnancy and cholera status, and pregnancy outcome. In this analysis we calculated risk ratios for fetal death and performed logistic regression analysis to control for confounding factors.Results: 263 pregnant women with cholera were hospitalized between December 2010 and July 2011. None died during hospitalization, 226 (86 percent) were discharged with a preserved pregnancy and 16 (6 percent) had live full term singleton births, of whom 2 died within the 1st 5 days postpartum. The remaining 21 pregnancies (8 percent) resulted in intrauterine fetal death. The risk of fetal death was associated with factors reflecting severity of the cholera episode: after adjusting for confounding factors, the strongest risk factor for fetal death was severe maternal dehydration (adjusted risk ratio for severe vs. mild dehydration was 9.4, 95 percent CI 2.5-35.3, pÛ =Û 0.005), followed by severe vomiting (adjusted risk ratio 5.1, 95 percent 1.1-23.8, pÛ =Û 0.041).Conclusion: This is the largest cohort of pregnant women with cholera described to date. The main risk factor identified for fetal death was severity of dehydration. Our experience suggests that establishing specialized multidisciplinary units which facilitate close follow-up of both pregnancy and dehydration status due to cholera could be beneficial for patients, especially in large epidemics.- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/93>.]
