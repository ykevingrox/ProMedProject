Four people died in one area, while dozens of people were infected. The affected areas are Abri and El Mahas, specifically Saadnafenti in El Mahas where a woman died on Sun 13 Aug 2017, bringing the total number of deaths in this area to 4 cases in 4 days. Dozens of people have been infected with cholera in El Mahas, in Daglo locality, on Sunday and Monday (13-14 Aug 2017) a source reported. This prompted 2 basic schools in Saadnafenti to close their doors.""Parents have prevented their children from going to El Tagmie Basic School on Sun 13 Aug 2017, while Saadnafenti School was closed after what seemed like an outbreak of cholera on Mon 14 Aug 2017"" another source told Radio Dabanga.Patients suffering from other diseases in El Tura Hospital in El Mahas have been evacuated as from Mon 14 Aug 2017; onward, the hospital will specialize in treating cholera cases.

In Abri, the number of hospitalized cases in the hospital amounted to 18 cases on Sun 13 Aug 2017, showing ""a steady increase"" according to the source.The National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017 that nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera patients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in Blue Nile state in August 2016. The Sudanese authorities, however, refuse to call the disease by its name, and instead refer to it as ""acute watery diarrhoea"". The National Intelligence and Security Service has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not to make mention of cholera.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - Sudan (Darfur states, Red Sea State)Date: Fri 11 Aug 2017Source: Radio Dabanga [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-thirteen-die-darfur-unhealed-patients-discharged>13 people died of cholera in West and Central Darfur this week. In Red Sea state, a local hospital recorded 5 new cholera cases, but discharged others who were still suffering from the rapidly spreading disease.Darfur states-----------------The current death toll in in the towns of Zalingei, Um Tajok in West Darfur, and Boronga in South Darfur (Kass locality) has run up to 26 people this week. The coordinator of the camps for displaced people in Central Darfur, El Shafie Abdallah, told Radio Dabanga about the deaths of 7 people. Five of them were from Hamidiya camp and the others from Hasahisa camp. He told Radio Dabanga that the 7 patients had been transferred from Hamidiya to the medical isolation centre at Zalingei hospital on Thu 10 Aug 2017.Six people died of cholera, and 18 others were infected at Um Tajok village, near Murnei in West Darfur on Wed 9 Aug 2017. A sheikh from the camp reported that 18 villagers were transferred to the medical isolation centre at Murnei. Meanwhile, a medical team arrived in Boronga village in Kass, South Darfur, after 13 people died of cholera and 45 others were infected. ""The team's arrival has led to a decrease in the spread of the infections and a reduction in the mortality rate. No new deaths have been reported in the village as of Wed 9 Aug 2017.""The sheikh from the area told Radio Dabanga that the medical team started treatment services with the available medicines, which led to the recovery of a number of patients.""30 infected patients have been discharged to cover up cholera in the hospital,"" a journalist reported.Red Sea--------On Thu 10 Aug 2017, the hospital in Tokar, Red Sea, recorded 5 new cholera cases, bringing the total number of patients in the isolation centre to 7. Most of the cases are concentrated in the outskirts of Tokar and in villages south of Tokar. In an interview with Radio Dabanga, journalist Osman Hashim said that the administration of the hospital has attempted to cover up cases of cholera to the public. ""On Wed 9 Aug 2017, the hospital administration discharged 30 cases before they had recovered in preparation for receiving a delegation from the Ministry of Health in the state."" Hashim reported that residents of Tokar have voluntarily undertaken efforts to reduce the spread of the disease.New report-------------Health experts of the Sudanese Communist Party in Khartoum have considered the government's policies not effective to respond to the epidemic, as a result of the health care approach that the Federal Health Ministry and its state counterparts adopted. The experts released a statement yesterday, 10 Aug 2017, claiming that Sudan has become ""a scene of the spread of various epidemics, in the light of the continuation of the medicine policy, where the country suffers from scarcity, disappearance, and lack of life-saving medicines.""The report said that more than 26 000 cases of cholera have been reported in the capital city and states, with a 5.6% mortality rate in 15 of the states.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Cholera - SomaliaDate: Sun 6 Aug 2017Source: World Health Organization, Government of Somalia [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/situation-report-acute-watery-diarrheacholera-epidemiological-week-31-31-july-6>Highlights--------- A total of 234 AWD/cholera cases and 2 deaths (CFR-1.0%) were reported from 16 districts in 11 regions during week 31.

Children like him are already weakened by hunger and illness, but are now facing the threat of contracting cholera.The deadly disease is one of the fastest spreading in Somaliland and is claiming the lives of many, from the old to the very young. In some areas, 500 cases are reported each day. And quarantine tents have been put up to deal with the most severely ill until they can be housed on hospital wards.Cholera is a treatable disease contracted through drinking dirty water. But it is something much of Somaliland's 4.5 million population have had to resort to as they stand on the brink of starvation. With more than half their livestock wiped out and no rain for 3 years, people consume whatever water they can find, even if it is contaminated by human waste or rotting animal carcasses.ITV News also spoke to a father who has lost 3 of his children to cholera, ""a father who had to bury 3 young children, who were only yesterday [6 Aug 2017] calling me dad and playing with me.""That is what has driven him to educate others about cholera so that they don't have to go through the devastation he has. Authorities have rushed to put together teams of volunteers to go into communities to help people avoid contracting cholera.The disease -- which has not been seen in developed countries like the UK for over 100 years -- can easily be treated using an oral rehydration sachet. But without treatment, a person can quickly become dehydrated, go into shock and die.For the people of Somaliland, fighting disease is just one of their daily struggles while they wait for the rain to come and aid to arrive.--Communicated by:ProMED-EAFR from HealthMap Alerts<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.""The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).""In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).""References----------57.
