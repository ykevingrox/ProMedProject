In December 2016, an _Aspergillus fumigatus_ DNA was found in a bone biopsy.The patient has improved since, with anti-fungal therapy (first with itraconazole and in the last 2 months changed to voriconazole). I think this is a possible etiology.It was a very difficult diagnosis, because normal fungal cultures were negative. We also did DNA and culture for _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ and it was negative.--Raquel Tavares, MDInfectious Diseases SpecialistHospital Beatriz AngeloLouresPortugal<raquelmrtavares@gmail.com>[Dr Tavares sent in additional information on this patient:- Male, 39 years of age, born at Democratic [Republic of Sao Tome and Principe] (STP), with a 2-year history of an extensive ulcer on the anterolateral side of the left leg, starting as nodules that ulcerated and coalesced, and associated with severe hypochromic microcytic anemia and loss of 24 kg, living in Portugal since March 2016, working as a taxi driver.- History of chronic hepatitis B infection- In STP, went daily to his farm, bathing daily in a river or small lakes.- No known allergies to any drugs.- No treatment to Buruli ulcer- In STP: November 2015: ampicillin 2 weeks- In Portugal: March 2016: amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, pantoprazol for 2 weeks for _H. pylori_ infection; April 2016: ciprofloxacin for 1 week, piperacillin/tazobactam for 1 week; ivermectin 18 mg oral once for ascariasis and strongyloidiasis; June-July 2016: empiric treatment with itraconazole for 6 weeks; October-November: itraconazole and vancomycin for 42 days; and since December 2016: voriconazole.- In August 2016: deep venous thrombosis complicated by pulmonary thromboembolism- No contaminated traumatic, burn, or surgical wounds, intravenous catheters, or use of occlusive dressings, adhesive tape, and plaster casts- Negative culture and DNA test (PCR) of ulcer tissue for _Mycobacterium ulcerans_- Histology of ulcer tissue, April 2016: ""stasis dermis, fibrosis area and inflammatory foreign body reaction and necrosis, PAS [Periodic Acid-Schiff], and Grocott [for fungi], and Ziehl-Neelsen [for mycobacteria] stains were negative.""The patient from STP described above with a leg ulcer had a positive PCR for _Aspergillus fumigatus_ in a bone biopsy and a presumptive diagnosis of primary cutaneous aspergillosis in an immunocompetent patient._Aspergillus fumigatus_ represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In these patients, cutaneous aspergillosis is usually a manifestation of disseminated _Aspergillus_ infection. Primary cutaneous disease is uncommon and can develop at the sites of contaminated traumatic, burn, and surgical wounds, intravenous catheters, and use of occlusive dressings, adhesive tape, and plaster casts (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC105285/>), which this patient did not have.Transmission of _M. ulcerans_ is thought to occur from contact with _M. ulcerans_-contaminated water, soil or vegetation, which the patient could have had when he bathed daily in a river or lakes in STP. Secondary, usually bacterial, infection is known to complicate Buruli ulcer, which the patient also apparently had (<http://www.who.int/buruli/information/diagnosis/en/index6.html>). The histology of the patient's ulcer biopsy was consistent with that of Buruli ulcer (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3000137/>), but staining of tissue was negative for mycobacteria and the culture and PCR for _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ were negative. However, the sensitivity for _M. ulcerans_ culture is reported to be only 50 percent for Buruli ulcer tissue, and only 20 percent for bone (<http://www.who.int/buruli/information/diagnosis/en/index8.html>); sensitivity of staining for mycobacteria in Buruli ulcer is only 40-60 percent (<http://www.who.int/buruli/information/diagnosis/en/index8.html> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1233911/>). However, the sensitivity of _M. ulcerans_ PCR is reported to be greater than 90 percent for ulcer tissue (<http://www.who.int/buruli/information/diagnosis/en/index8.html> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1233911/>).The patient's diagnosis of primary cutaneous aspergillosis is based solely on a positive PCR in bone for _Aspergillus_. Considering that _Aspergillus_ is a ubiquitous organism, a positive PCR for this organism may very well be due to minute contamination of the bone specimen with fungal DNA. Cutaneous aspergillosis, if the diagnosis is correct, may be secondary to whatever caused the initial leg ulcer.In any case, what does this patient's diagnosis, if correct, imply about the diagnoses in the other 1094 cases of ulcer disease that have been reported in STP since October 2016? It would be very unusual if any of the others in STP has cutaneous aspergillosis, unless, as ProMED-mail Mod.MPP suggested, others have used some medication contaminated with _Aspergillus_ that was applied to their ulcers.Nevertheless, more information on this outbreak in Sao Tome is needed -- a clear clinical description of the skin lesions, the results of tests used to confirm a diagnosis of Buruli ulcer, that is, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), acid-fast staining, histopathology, and culture, and evaluation for other conditions that could cause cutaneous ulcer disease in this population.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63>. - Mod.ML][See Also:Buruli ulcer - SÌ£o TomÌ© and PrÌ ncipe (02): comment, RFI 20170210.4830051Buruli ulcer - SÌ£o TomÌ© and PrÌ ncipe 20170208.4824961].................................................mpp/ml/mj/jh"
