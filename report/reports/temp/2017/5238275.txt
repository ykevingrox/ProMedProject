Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-08/09/c_136509979.htm>Yemen has prepared emergency plans to continue the fight against cholera aimed at improving the sanitation system, providing clean water, and raising public awareness about this epidemic, officials said on [Tue 8 Aug 2017]. The death toll from cholera climbed to 1940 and the suspected cases to more than 463 000 on [Sun 6 Aug 2017], said Abdulhakim Al-Kuhlani, spokesperson for the public health and population ministry in Sanaa.""We have a national emergency plan focused on improving epidemiological surveillance, providing fast response teams and necessary medicines, and opening treatment centers across the republic,"" Al-Kuhlani said.Spokesperson for the health ministry within the legitimate government in Aden, Mohammed Mustafa Yasin, said their plan is focused on environmental sanitation. ""The efforts to contain cholera require cooperation among all sectors, like the health ministry, the cleanliness fund, civil society and media,"" Yasin elaborated. ""We are also launching a house-to-house health education campaign.""More than a million children suffering from acute malnutrition, including almost 200 000 with severe acute malnutrition, are caught in the areas hit hardest by a deadly outbreak of cholera, Save the Children warned last week [week of 1 Aug 2017].Yemeni officials said the number of suspected cases per day has slightly decreased in recent weeks in some areas thanks to quick and effective interventions. ""In Aden, we are now receiving tens of suspected cases a day. In the 1st months of the outbreak, we were receiving hundreds of suspected cases a day,"" said Yasin.Collapsing healthcare and sanitation systems, damaged water infrastructure, and malnutrition, all direct consequences of a war continuing for more than 2.5 years, are making people more vulnerable to cholera, agencies said, while calling for scaling up aid to the country.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although a number of sources have reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the new numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017 with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that time period.The statistics related to this record-breaking epidemic of _V. cholerae_ in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 182825 Jul / 402 484 / 188026 Jul / 408 583 / 188529 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 1940In the last complete year of data (2015; <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>), WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
