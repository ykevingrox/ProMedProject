Express [edited]<http://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/844891/Asian-mosquitos-Britain-Eurotunnel-dengue-fever-chikungunya-virus-UK>Health specialists have blitzed a clutch of notorious [Asian] tiger mosquitoes suspected to have smuggled their way into Britain through the Eurotunnel. The invasive Asiatic mosquitoes can carry dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, and attack in daylight.Experts from Public Health England destroyed the batch of mosquito eggs and larvae at the busy Ashford International truck stop earlier this month [August 2017]. This is the 2nd time that one of the planet's most dangerous insects -- so-named because of its striped body and legs -- has been discovered entering into the UK during the last year.Asian tiger mosquitoes -- scientific name, _Aedes albopictus_ -- have been spreading across Europe and are blamed for up to a million global cases of chikungunya globally every year. The disease has no cure and leaves victims in a fever and with excruciating joint pains as well as headaches, nausea and rashes. There is a death risk of one in a thousand cases. France confirmed 4 cases in 2014 and there was an epidemic in Italy a decade ago.Asian tiger mosquitoes are spreading the disease through the way their eggs and larvae have been exported from native forest haunts in south east Asia in tyre imports. The grubs [eggs] can survive for months [and larvae and pupae develop] in small pockets of water retained by tyres.To counter the threat, the authorities are maintaining a ""mosquito surveillance programme"" at 30 UK ports and airports as well as checks at motorway services on routes from south coast ports and Eurotunnel. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, said: ""Through these activities we identified a small number of eggs and larvae from the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito in traps at Ashford International truck stop.[byline: Stuart Winter]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report of the discovery of _Aedes albopictus_ at a truck stop in Kent appears to be valid this time and illustrates how this species can be moved internationally. A 2014 report of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern England was rejected. A statement by Jolyon Medlock, head of Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Public Health England, Microbiological Research Authority (MRA), Emergency Response Department, Health Protection and Medical Directorate, Porton Down, Salisbury stated, ""This is misleading information as no invasive aedes mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently [2014] about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive aedes mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England."" (see Invasive mosquito - UK (02): (England) comment 20140923.2795988).Intensive surveillance will be carried out this time as well. One hopes that successful aggressive efforts to eliminate the mosquitoes before they can become established, as they have become established in Italy and southern France. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6406>.]
