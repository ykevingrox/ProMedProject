ZNBC [edited]<http://www.znbc.co.zm/?p=48765>To date, 6 people have died of anthrax in Lulangu'nyi Ward in Chief Namulimbwa' s area in Sikongo District in Western Province, and 2 other people are admitted in Kalabo District hospital.Sikongo Health Director Fredrick Siyunda and Lulangu'nyi Ward Councilor Kennedy Simbotwe have both confirmed the development to ZANIS [Zambia News and Information Services] in Kalabo in separate interviews.Counselor Simbotwe disclosed that the 6 people died in a space of 5 days with the latest death recorded today [7 Feb 2017]. He said out of the 6, 2 were men while 4 were women. Dr Siyunda said his ministry has also engaged the department of livestock to ensure people are treated and animals get vaccinated. He said community members were allegedly hiding meat from sick animals in their homes each time health officers were on the ground to help dispose of the carcasses.Dr Siyunda has since appealed to community members in affected areas to stop eating meat from dead animals if the disease is to be contained.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Ongoing human cases and deaths would suggest that bovine cases are still occurring, possibly in new areas outside direct veterinary oversight. Apropos, latterly there have been a number of Zambian news reports on this epidemic but none added anything new, just journalistic cut-and-paste, which to a cynical outsider, suggests that the journalists are getting rural gossip from their contacts and relatives but no editorial permission to go scouting out possible new areas and stories. ""It's just anthrax. They get it all the time out there."" Maybe, but one of the proven ways to stop human cases is to radically sharpen human awareness of the risks, and to make sure that the livestock in the various areas get vaccinated without delay.The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at <http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22476> or in ProMED 20170124.4787317. - Mod.MHJ]
