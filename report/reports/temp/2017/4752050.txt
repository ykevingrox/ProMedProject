It is about sensitizing them and showing them the health risk they may have"", he concluded.Worldwide, it is estimated that there are more than 69 000 deaths due to rabies annually.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Cases of human rabies, including deaths, are frequently reported in the Amazon. There, several strains of the rabid virus circulate in the vampire bat, _Desmodus rotundus_. In remote rural areas, post exposure vaccination schemes are rarely implemented and this results in several human deaths. - Mod.PMBMaps of Peru can be seen at <http://www.geographicguide.com/pictures/peru-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54393>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
