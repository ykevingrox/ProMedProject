There had been similarly associated 4 cases in Germany and 2 in Spain in November/December 2016 (none fatal), triggering a large international recall of dried roach products (See also ECDC/EFSA joint outbreak risk assessment December 2016 <http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/01-12-2016-RRA-Botulism-Germany,%20Spain.pdf>).All cases in 2016 and 2017 have been adults with either Russian or (1 case) Kazakh background, who purchased the fish in grocery stores specializing in Eastern European products. Regarding the current case, food safety authorities have recalled the implicated product. Investigations on whether and how this new case is connected to the previous cases are ongoing.Recall: <http://www.lebensmittelwarnung.de/bvl-lmw-de/app/process/warnung/detail17/20093> [machine transl, edited]Danger of botulism: Ministry warns against the consumption of ""roach"" dried fish--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Lower Saxony Ministry of Agriculture strongly warns against the consumption of dry fish with the product name ""Rutilus rutilus, dried and salted"", which is offered in particular in Russian shopping malls. There is a risk that the food of the dry fish in humans causes the life-threatening poisoning of botulism.Consumers who bought such fish should not eat the goods. Anyone who experiences symptoms such as unusual headaches and nausea, vomiting, stomach cramp, diarrhea or paralysis symptoms should seek immediate medical attention. In most cases, paralysis affects the eyes and vision, and the eyelids can often no longer be moved. Other symptoms may include speech disorders, a dry mouth, dyspnoea, or dyspnea.The reason for the warning is the case of a patient, who was initially admitted to a clinic with the suspicion of botulism. This suspicion has been confirmed today [Thu 4 May 2017] after tests. The dry fish, consumed by the patient, in which the pathogen was detected today, comes from a shopping market in Damme (district of Vechta), which in turn purchased the goods from a wholesaler in the OsnabrÌ ck district. The authorities there have acted promptly. A potential sale of other trades is currently under review by the supervisory authorities.Botulism is a life-threatening poisoning that can be caused by the consumption of spoiled meat or fish. The trigger is the toxin botulinum toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism must be treated promptly, as otherwise it can lead to death--Hendrik WilkingGastrointestinal Infections, Zoonoses, and Tropical Infections, Department for Infectious Disease EpidemiologyConsultant laboratory for neurotoxin-producing clostridia (botulism, tetanus), Centre for Biological Threats and Special PathogensRobert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany<WilkingH@rki.de>[ProMED thanks Dr Wilking for this report.Many of the botulism risks related to salted, cured fish are a result of the fish not being adequately eviscerated. The viscera of the fish are the parts most likely to be contaminated. As here, most cases of botulism associated with the aquatic environment are serotype E whereas most other cases in humans are either type A or B. The ECDC report from 20 Dec 2016 mentioned above is shown here:Type E botulism associated with fish product consumption - Germany and Spain -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Disease background information------------------------------Botulism is a serious and potentially fatal paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by anaerobic clostridia bacteria, most often _Clostridium botulinum_. Clostridia occur commonly in soil, dust, the aquatic environment and in the intestines of animals. Consequently, _C. botulinum_ can be present in a wide range of foods. Foodborne botulism is caused by the consumption of food where germination and multiplication of _C. botulinum_ has occurred, accompanied by neurotoxin production. Botulism from commercially prepared food is usually associated with a failure during the preparation process, or a problem with container/pack integrity. Historically a high percentage of botulism outbreaks have been associated with home-preserved foods [1]. There are 3 forms of disease depending on the site of toxin production: foodborne (ingestion of pre-formed toxin); infant and wound botulism. Botulism is not spread from one person to another [2]. The botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) produces descending, flaccid paralysis without fever. Patients typically present with difficulty in speaking, seeing and swallowing. If untreated, paralysis may progress to the arms, legs, trunk and respiratory muscles, requiring mechanical ventilation. Treatment includes antimicrobials (wound botulism) and the administration of antitoxins, usually bivalent AB or trivalent ABE antitoxin [3]. The case-fatality rate is around 5 to 10 percent for adequately treated patients. The botulinum neurotoxins have traditionally been divided into 7 toxin types (A to G) according to their antigenic properties [4]. A new toxin type H has been discovered recently in the USA [5]. _C. botulinum_ exhibits phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, and group I (proteolytic, able to produce BoNT A, B and F) and group II (non-proteolytic, able to produce BoNT B, E or F) are responsible for food-borne botulism [6]. Foodborne botulism outbreaks involving Group II BoNT E have been frequently associated with the consumption of fish and fish products [6,7], probably due to temperature abuse as this group of bacteria is psychrotrophic and grows well in anaerobic, chilled environments [4,6]. While _C. botulinum_ is the most common species producing botulinum neurotoxins, rare cases of BoNT E have been caused by _C. butyricum_ [8]. Botulism is a rare disease in the EU/EEA, with 85 to 137 confirmed cases having been reported to ECDC annually during the period 2010-2015. Italy accounted for 28 percent of the cases, followed by Romania (19 percent). Cases have been reported in all age groups, with most cases among those aged 25-44 years (32 percent) and 45-64 years (31 percent). Cases have been more common among men than women (male/female ratio 1.3:1). The majority (98 percent) of infections were domestically acquired. Neurotoxin type was introduced in the data collection from 2013 and only 4 cases of type E and four cases with neurotoxin type B were reported in the period 2013-2014 (no neurotoxin type E cases reported in 2015).Type E botulism associated with fish product consumption, 20 December 2016--------------------------------------------------------------------------Event background information----------------------------On [22 Nov 2016], Germany reported 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of foodborne botulism BoNT -type E in adult males from 2 neighboring states with onset dates in early November [2016] to the Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses (EPIS-FWD). Both patients had clinical symptoms compatible with botulism and their stool samples were confirmed positive for gene-encoding BoNT E in the German Consultant Laboratory for botulism. Both patients had eaten 'dried and salted roach' (_Rutilus rutilus_). On [28 Nov 2016], Germany posted an alert in the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS). On [7 Dec 2016], Germany updated EWRS with information on an additional case, later confirmed, from a 3rd German state with clinical symptoms of botulism and disease onset [24 Nov 2016]. The patient had eaten dried and salted roach (_Rutilus rutilus_). Analyses of fecal samples were initiated in order to verify the botulism. The 3 German patients have a Russian background. On [19 Dec 2016], Germany reported a 4th confirmed case of foodborne botulism in a female with a Kazakh background through EWRS. She had consumed dried and salted roach and fell ill on [11 Dec 2016].On [25 Nov 2016], Spain reported 2 probable cases of botulism in partners (1 male and 1 female). The cases were Russian nationals with residence in Spain who consumed dried and salted fish 'PlÌ¦tze Salz' (_Rutilus rutilus_) and developed symptoms on [5 and 6 Nov 2016]. The results of the clinical samples tested were negative. Microbiological and environmental investigations of the food -------------------------------------------------------------This section summarizes the information on traceability and microbiological investigations on food related to this outbreak that has been reported to the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) (last update: [15 Dec 2016]), as well as additional information reported by the competent authorities of the interested Member States to EFSA in the context of this outbreak (last update: [19 Dec 2016]). The graphical representation of the traceability information available in RASFF is illustrated in Figure 1. On [25 Nov 2016], Germany issued a RASFF message (2016.1621) pertaining to the recall of 'dried and salted roach (_Rutilus rutilus_)' distributed within Germany and to other EU/EEA Member States. Two fish samples taken from a patient's home were tested with real-time PCR and found to be positive for the BoNT E -gene. Colonies of _Clostridium botulinum_ isolated from these samples were also tested and found positive to BoNT E -gene. The 2 samples were negative when tested with mouse-bioassay.The first 2 German cases bought and consumed the fish product of concern from separate locations of the same chain of grocery stores belonging to wholesaler A, which received the product from a producer in the Netherlands (Producer A) (Figure 1). The German wholesaler A also received 'dried and salted roach (_Rutilus rutilus_)' from another 2 producers in Lithuania. Additional epidemiological investigations and analyses were carried out by the Lithuanian authorities. Based on the current state of available information, there is no evidence of their involvement in the outbreak cases.Wholesaler A further distributed the fish product originating from Producer A to Germany, France, Italy and 2 wholesalers in Spain (including wholesaler G, mentioned below). The Dutch producer A also delivered fish to additional wholesalers in Germany (wholesalers B, C, D and E) and the UK (wholesaler F). Each of these German wholesalers further distributed the fish product to Germany and other countries, including Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland, as indicated in Figure 1. Sweden further distributed the product originating from the German wholesaler E to Norway (Figure 1). The 3rd German case consumed 'dried and salted roach (Rutilus rutilus)' that he had bought in a store to which the implicated product (as indicated in the RASFF notification) was delivered from wholesaler A (Figure 1). According to the information available, it was not possible to trace this product further back to the producer level. According to the information reported by Germany in EWRS on [19 Dec 2016], the leftover dried and salted roach consumed by the 4th German case was reported to be PCR-positive for BoNT E gene. The consumed dried fish was bought on [12 Nov 2016], before the recall of the implicated products. Since no traceability information on the fish product consumed by the 4th German case is currently available in RASFF, this case has not been included in Figure 1.Both Spanish cases had ingested dried and salted roach (Rutilus rutilus) and according to the label, the product was distributed from a Spanish wholesaler (wholesaler G) and was manufactured by the Dutch producer A (Figure 1). The competent authorities in the Netherlands reported that Producer A has collected single samples from different batches of the implicated product to test for the presence of the BoNT gene using real-time PCR. All tested samples were reported to be negative for the gene coding for botulinum neurotoxins A, B, E and F. Producer A did not distribute the implicated product further within the Dutch market. Restrictive measures were taken (i.e. recall from consumer, withdrawal from the market) and targeted public warnings issued in Germany, Spain and the other countries where the fish product concerned by the RASFF notifications was distributed.ECDC and EFSA threat assessment for the EU/EEA-----------------------------------------------There are 4 confirmed botulism E cases in Germany and 2 probable cases in Spain. The clustering in time and very likely link to the consumption of commercially available dried and salted roach (_Rutilus rutilus_) indicates that this fish product may be a common source. A total of 5 human cases have a Russian background and 1 case has a Kazakh background. The implicated fish product has been distributed to several EU/EEA Member States and intensive recall measures have been initiated in the countries concerned following the German RASFF notification (2016.1621) on [25 Nov 2016]. Botulism neurotoxin type E is not an uncommon contamination in fish products, which have been poorly eviscerated and/or self-salted at home [1]. Contamination in commercial fish products has also been reported [10]. For this outbreak, the populations at the greatest risk are those who traditionally consume salted and dried roach ('vobla'). The risk for other population groups is very low in EU/EEA. In view of the rapid initiation of recalls and targeted public warnings, the risk that new cases linked to the outbreak will appear in the EU/EEA is considered to be very low. The main potential residual risk of exposure relates to consumers still keeping the product at home who may not been made aware of the public warnings, or stores that may not have received notification of the recall and are continuing to sell the implicated fish product. There is no risk of person-to-person transmission.References----------1.
