Daily Mail, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4727662/Japan-woman-dies-tick-disease-bitten-sick-cat.html#ixzz4nrZJ3dcX>A Japanese woman [died last year, 2016] from a tick-borne virus after being bitten by a stray cat in what is possibly the world's 1st animal-to-human transmission of the disease.The woman in her 50s died some 10 days after being bitten by the cat last year after she took the animal to a veterinary hospital.Authorities have since confirmed that she developed SFTS, a disease transmitted by bites from a certain group of virus-carrying ticks.Human-to-human infections of the tick virus through blood contact have been reported, but ministry officials believe the Japanese woman's death could be the 1st case of a human dying from the bite of an infected animal.""No reports on animal-to-human transmission cases have been made so far,"" a health ministry official told AFP on [Tue 25 Jul 2017]. ""It's still not confirmed the virus came from the cat, but it's possible that it's the (world's) 1st case,"" she said.Another official said there were no signs the woman had been bitten by a tick.SFTS, or severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, triggers symptoms including severe fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea.In Japan some 60 people contract the disease every year from tick bites with a fatality rate of some 20 percent, according to the Japanese ministry.No preventive medicines or vaccines are available for the disease. ""There are only symptomatic therapies, such as dealing with fever or diarrhoea,"" the ministry official said. ""The best way to avoid the infection is not to be bitten by ticks,"" she added.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur George A Robertson[SFTS cases have been reported in Japan before. In 2013, the total number of cases came to 8, and while at that time the 1st 5 were all deaths, these 3 people, infected between 2005 and 2012, all recovered. In 2014 SFTS virus infected 53 people and left 21 people dead. SFTS virus has been shown to be tick transmitted. Apparently, the diagnosis has been laboratory confirmed for the woman but no mention is made that the cat had a confirmed SFTS infection, leaving doubt about the cat as a source of the woman's infection.SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the bunyavirus family. Characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described first by Yu XJ et al in ""Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China"" (N Engl J Med. 2011; 364(16): 1523-32; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095>).- Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.]
