The San Diego Union-Tribune [edited]<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/sd-me-hepatitis-emergency-20170901-story.html>San Diego County declared a local health emergency early [Fri 1 Sep 2017] night, adding a new level of urgency to a hepatitis A outbreak that has hit the homeless population hardest, killing 15 people and hospitalizing hundreds. Dr Wilma Wooten, the region's public health officer, signed the declaration shortly after lawyers finished writing it, bolstering the county Health and Human Services Agency's ability to request assistance from the state and providing legal protections for a slate of actions that began unfolding across the city earlier in the day.Working on a county contract, a private company began delivering portable hand-washing stations [Fri 1 Sep 2017] morning, in locations where homeless residents tend to congregate. Up to 20 stations were in place by the end of the day and 20 more, a county spokesman said, were scheduled for installation [Sat 2 Sep 2017]. That effort is to be followed by street-cleaning crews shooting high-pressure water spiked with bleach to remove ""all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,"" according to a sanitation plan included in a letter delivered to city government [Thu 31 Aug 2017].The cleansing plans, Wooten said, are modeled on similar efforts used to control hepatitis A infections in Los Angeles. ""We know that LA has had no local cases of hepatitis A related to the strain that we're seeing here in San Diego,"" she said. ""It makes sense that, if they're doing it there and they haven't had any cases, it could be beneficial here as well."" It has been clear for some time that the local outbreak is far beyond ordinary. With 379 cases confirmed to date, it's the largest surge seen in at least 20 years.The 1st cases linked to the outbreak occurred in November 2016, but there weren't enough of them until about May 2017 for local epidemiologists to know for sure that infections were spreading more quickly than usual. Most hepatitis A outbreaks are associated with specific foods picked or processed under unsanitary conditions. The virus that causes the condition is excreted in human feces and can be spread when people don't wash their hands thoroughly enough after using the bathroom.From the outset, the public health response to the outbreak has been vaccination and education. Though thousands of doses of vaccine have been distributed to date, that effort has not appreciably slowed infection rates while the number of deaths reported in recent weeks has accelerated. Because infections are most common among the homeless who often have no access to sanitary facilities, the county's efforts began to turn toward hand washing and street cleaning in early summer. But that transition has been painfully slow.An article earlier this week [week of Sun 27 Aug 2017] published by Voice of San Diego pointed out bureaucratic hurdles which have delayed sanitation improvements even as public health nurses pursued a countywide vaccination campaign which targeted the homeless at shelters, while mobile teams explored the more remote locations where those without homes tend to go. The delivered letter on [Thu 31 Aug 2017] was the 1st time the health department gave pointed and unequivocal direction to the city, stating that the municipality should take ""immediate action"" to ""address the unsanitary living conditions of the at-risk population.""The city responded early [Fri 1 Sep 2017] morning, with a press release that indicated it would work with the county to follow its guidelines, however, it may take 10 days to comply with the street-washing request due to a lawsuit that requires 72-hours' notice before the spraying begins.The sudden action begs a simple question: Why didn't all of this start back in late June or early July 2017 when the county 1st talked about hand-washing stations?San Diego City Councilman David Alvarez fired off a memo to Mayor Kevin Faulconer [Thu 31 Aug 2017], demanding a crisis declaration, expressing his dissatisfaction that the outbreak has continued to claim lives while the city continues to wait for resolution to provide temporary housing which would presumably bring with it better access to the bathrooms and showers necessary to alleviate the current mess on city streets. ""I just assumed the county was doing everything that they could do and that the city was facilitating what the county needed, but that has not been the case,"" Alvarez said. ""It just infuriated me that the bureaucracy was getting in the way of doing the right thing.""Criticism has also come from state Sen. Ben Hueso and the Service Employees Union International which have both said they do not believe the county employs enough public health nurses to meet the demands of the hepatitis A investigation while also handling large children's health and foster care programs. On [Wed 30 Aug 2017], the state legislature's Joint Committee On Legislative Audit approved Hueso's request to determine whether or not the amount of health resources available are adequate. Committee members approved the audit request 10-3, and it is expected to take between 4 and 5 months to complete.There was a lot of finger pointing between City Hall and the County Administration Center. Both sides insisted they were doing what they could in a situation that is unique.""There is no precedent for this,"" Wooten said. ""We will definitely have a playbook for if we have something like this in the future, but this is the 1st time we have had something of this nature happen."" She added that, in the coming days and weeks, the hand-washing and street-sanitizing efforts underway in San Diego will spread to other cities. ""We were talking to El Cajon already, and we will be talking to Escondido, Oceanside, National City and Chula Vista soon,"" Wooten said.[Byline: Paul Sisson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall******[2] Santa Cruz CountyDate: Thu 31 Aug 2017 7:20 PM PDTSource: Santa Cruz Sentinel [edited]<http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20170831/NEWS/170839935>From a handful of cases in April 2017, hepatitis A has spread to 65 people, many of them homeless and many of them drug users, and Dr Arnold Leff, Santa Cruz County health officer, has been leading an effort to contain the disease.So far: - 850 vaccinations have been given. - Vaccination clinics are ongoing at a half-dozen locations, including the jail and the emergency department at Dignity Health Dominican Hospital. - Vaccine outreach is targeting parks and camp sites where those infected spent time. - Plans are being made for clinics to vaccinate county staff and others at risk of contracting the highly contagious disease.The outbreak has affected about twice as many men as women, 62 percent being under age 40, according to Leff's data. About 80 percent reported being homeless, 75 percent reported illicit drug use, and 64 percent indicated drug use and homelessness, Leff's figures show.Hepatitis A spreads when a person eats or drinks something contaminated with the hepatitis A virus. If someone who is infected doesn't wash his hands well after using the bathroom and then touches food, the disease can be passed to others who eat that food. Male homosexuals having sex with an infected person is another way to contract the disease.Dominican Hospital reports seeing more than 30 cases of hepatitis A since spring.. ""It is really concerning,"" said Dr John Kaufmann, an infectious disease specialist who has worked at Dominican Hospital for 12 years. ""We have 2 cases a year normally."" When people come to the emergency room for other reasons other than hepatitis A, those identified at high risk of contracting hepatitis A are offered the vaccine. Close to 100 vaccinations have been given, Kaufmann said.Leff's data show a spike of 11 cases reported in one week in mid-July 2017, then dropping, but Kauffman said he doesn't know if the outbreak is declining. ""We want to assume the worst,"" he said. ""We want to make sure people get the vaccination. Caregivers, drug users, people who are homeless, anyone who wants the vaccine should get it."" A 2nd dose of vaccine is needed after 6 months, he said. He said the vaccine is for people who are not infected.People who are infected can recover in 6 months with rest, avoiding alcohol and drinking plenty of water. But there can be complications.In San Diego County, 15 people have died from hepatitis A, but health officials have not found a common source of food, beverages or drugs to trigger the outbreak. ""We're doing everything we can to protect people that come into our jail,"" said Sgt. Chris Clark, spokesman for the sheriff's office. ""It's affecting a vulnerable population in our community and we understand that,""[Byline: Jondi Gumz]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California has continued to increase.

Additionally, street-cleaning crews shooting high-pressure water spiked with bleach to remove ""all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,"" although it is not clear that such contaminated surfaces exist and if they do, it should not take a HAV outbreak to clean them up.It is interesting that San Diego County and Santa Cruz County are about 400 miles (644 km) apart, with San Diego in southernmost California bordering Mexico and Santa Cruz just south of San Francisco. Clearly the underlying potential risk factors seem similar and it would be quite interesting to know if the genetic evaluation of the viruses from both counties, if available, is identical or not. Another ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A, in eastern Michigan, has been reported to be genetically different from the San Diego cohort.The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4262>.
