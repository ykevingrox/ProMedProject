EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The number of (diagnosed) cases in Norway has been low and geographically distributed in a way that makes a travel hub or destination a likely common point of infection, and a probable common point has been identified as an Oslo Airport cafÌ©. Because of delays in reporting and diagnosis epidemiological investigation is still ongoing, so it is early to say what the final result will be.I would suggest that the main confounders will be a) not seeing a doctor when ill, b) if diagnosed at visit no microbiology is asked for, and c) sample taken after illness in reality has cleared.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[I would like to thank Ann Lindberg for clarifying that most of the cases of _S._ Typhimurium in Norway are not related to the concurrent outbreak in Sweden and thank the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for the comment. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/107>.]
