Healthcare workers at the frontline working to save lives were at 21 to 32 times greater risk to acquiring infection than the general population(<http://www.who.int/hrh/documents/21may2015_web_final.pdf>.)While PPE use or failures could not be linked to transmission of infection, challenges in training, sustained training and other human factors suggested that improved PPE characteristics, design and training along with other infection prevention strategies can reduce the occupational risk for developing infections.PPE component are not designed to purposely fit together as an outfit to protect against highly transmissible infections like the Ebola virus. Healthcare workers at the frontline experienced extreme overheating, inability to communicate, inconsistent training and other factors that impaired greatly their ability to deliver compassionate services.Therefore:Technical Advisory Committees with members from WHO, UNICEF, MSF, USAID, ECDC, healthcare workers and many other academic and governmental organizations have been working towards defining an innovative product that can protect healthcare workers at the frontline and allow them to provide effective care to patients.A total of 10 ideal characteristics are proposed and these are open for public consultation so that the ideal PPE could be designed and manufactured accordingly, please share this link to anybody related to use, design, management of PPE. WHO would welcome both institutional/organization responses as well as from individuals.The consultation is open from 6th to 28th September [2017] at:<http://www.who.int/medical_devices/document4open-consultation/en/>Information Contact:<techinnovation@who.int>--Adriana Velazquez BerumenSenior Advisor on Medical Devices Innovation Access and UseMedicines and Health products DepartmentHealth Systems and InnovationWorld Health OrganizationGeneva, Switzerland<techinnovation@who.int>[ProMED was asked to convey this directly to our members, particularly those who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa. Please send comments directly to WHO at the address listed. - Mod.LM][Development of PPE that avoids the difficulties of currently available equipment (overheating, interference with communication) would be helpful in preventing nosocomial transmission of Lassa fever and Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever as well. However, better PPE alone will not be enough to prevent transmission of these viruses in hospital and clinic settings. The PPE must be accompanied by adequate training and rountine practice in use of this equipment.  - Mod. TY][This is a good approach to designing improved PPE, particularly for use in hot climates. As recognized, effective and functional PPE requires ergonomic design, breathability to reduce heat stress, good visibility and communication, as well as durability of the product. In addition, ease of donning and removal after use of the PPE must be incorporated into the design. And importantly, an SOP with training on proper usage must be strictly implemented. The health care workers who actually used PPE during the outbreak will be able to provide the most knowledgeable input on what exactly which characteristics of PPE they feel are most critical to incorporate into the design. - Mod.LK].................................................lm/ec/ty/lk/mpp"
