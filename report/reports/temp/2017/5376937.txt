The Guardian [edited]<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year>The cholera epidemic in Yemen has become the largest and fastest-spreading outbreak of the disease in modern history, with a million cases expected by the end of 2017 and at least 600 000 children likely to be affected. The WHO has reported more than 815 000 suspected cases of the disease in Yemen and 2156 deaths. About 4000 suspected cases are being reported daily, more than half of which are among children under 18. Children under 5 account for a quarter of all cases.The spread of the outbreak, which has quickly surpassed Haiti as the biggest since modern records began in 1949, has been exacerbated by hunger and malnutrition. While there were 815 000 cases of cholera in Haiti between 2010 and 2017, Yemen has exceeded that number in just 6 months.Save the Children has warned that, at the current rate of infection, the number of cases will reach 7 figures before the turn of the year, 60 percent of which will be among children. In July 2017, the International Committee of the Red Cross predicted there would be 600 000 suspected cholera cases in the country by the end of 2017.Tamer Kirolos, Save the Children's country director for Yemen, said an outbreak of this scale and speed is ""what you get when a country is brought to its knees by conflict, when a healthcare system is on the brink of collapse, when its children are starving, and when its people are blocked from getting the medical treatment they need"". Kirolos said: ""There's no doubt this is a man-made crisis. Cholera only rears its head when there's a complete and total breakdown in sanitation. All parties to the conflict must take responsibility for the health emergency we find ourselves in.""More than 2 years of fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels has crippled the country, causing widespread internal displacement, the collapse of the public health system, and leaving millions on the brink of famine. The crisis was exacerbated when sanitation workers whose salaries had gone unpaid went on strike. This meant garbage was left on the streets, which was then washed into the water supply. It is estimated that 19.3 million Yemenis - more than 2-thirds of the population - do not have access to clean water and sanitation.The government stopped funding the public health department in 2016, meaning many doctors and hospital staff have not received salaries for more than a year. Healthcare has since been provided mainly by international organizations, the efforts of whom have been hampered by the conflict.The spread of the disease has nonetheless slowed. At the beginning of the most recent outbreak, in May this year [2017], between 5000 and 6000 new cases were detected daily. That rate has since dropped to just under 4000 a day. The mortality rate has also declined, from one percent at the beginning of the outbreak to 0.26 percent now.""Whatever decline we're seeing now is due to the heroic efforts of workers at the scene,"" said Sherin Varkey, the officiating representative of Unicef Yemen. Varkey said the situation would not be solved until there was peace in the country. ""There are no signals that give us any reason for optimism. We know that both parties to the conflict are continuing with their blatant disregard of the rights of children,"" he said. ""We're at a cliff and we're staring down and it is bottomless. There seems to be no hope.""Cholera should be easily treatable with oral rehydration salts and access to clean water. But Mariam Aldogani, Save the Children's health adviser for the city of Hodeidah, said conditions in the country had made this very difficult. Aldogani said: ""All the NGOs are trying to increase the knowledge of how to prevent the disease, because it's preventable, you have to boil the water. But if you don't have money to buy gas, and you have to walk a long way to get the wood, how can you boil the water?""Aldogani, who has been a doctor since 2010, said witnessing the suffering of her patients was deeply painful. ""I saw one young man, he had cholera and severe dehydration. He was in a coma and he died in front of his mother. We tried our best, but he came too late and she was crying, and I cried. It makes me angry. When I see a mother lose her baby, especially a stillbirth, she waits for this baby for a long time and then she loses it because of cholera, it makes me so angry.""The war is a big problem for us, it's a wound. But with the cholera, you have the wound and you put salt in the wound. It hurts. I hope this war can be stopped. We need peace for the children of Yemen. Our situation before the war was not good, but it was not like this.""[Byline: Kate Lyons]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[As this incredibly horrific story goes on and on, the continuing statistics of this record epidemic of _V. cholerae_ in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2514 May / 11 000 / 18021 May / 29 300 / 31527 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5326 Jun / 96 000 / 74614 Jun / 140 116 / 98921 Jun / 179 548 / 120528 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15007 Jul / 297 438 / 170613 Jul / 332 600 / 175920 Jul / 368 207 / 182829 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199725 Aug / 565 041 / 201830 Aug / 591 100 / 20358 Sep / 635 752 / 206217 Sep / 686 783 / 209020 Sep / 704 454 / 210324 Sep / 738 212 / 211727 Sep / 753 098 / 212229 Sep / 767 524 / 21272 Oct / 777 229 / 21344 Oct / 791 551 / 21426 Oct / 800 626 / 215111 Oct / 815 000 / 2156In 2015 <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.In 2016 <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/258910/1/WER9236.pdf>, the total number of cases was 132 121 from 38 countries.This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is less than 6 months old and is 6.2 times the total number of global cases of 2016 and 2.4 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.27 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. There are now as many cases in less than 6 months than the entire 7 years of the Haitian cholera disaster.As estimates here have been suggesting for some time, the authorities now state that the total will likely break one million by 2017's end. However, at 4000 cases per day, one million cases could be reached in about 46 days just after 23 Nov 2017, poetically the day of the American Thanksgiving. There is no reason to believe that, even with the vaccination campaign, the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh will not suffer a large cholera outbreak as well. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
