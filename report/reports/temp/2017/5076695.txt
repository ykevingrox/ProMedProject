WKRG [edited]<http://wkrg.com/2017/05/31/gulf-coast-sees-first-case-of-flesh-eating-bacteria-this-season/>A spokesperson for Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula, Mississippi confirms they've seen their 1st positive case of _Vibrio vulnificus_ this season. The organism is often referred to as the 'flesh-eating bacterium' because it can cause necrotizing wounds on the skin that can lead to amputation or in the most severe cases, loss of life.According to a close friend, the patient was fishing near Souix Bayou over the weekend when he accidentally stuck himself with a shrimp. Several hours later he was taken to the hospital with a high fever, pain, and swelling in his finger.Mark Bryant of the Mobile County Health Department said they haven't seen any water-related cases in Mobile County yet, only 2 minor food-related cases.[byline: Emily DeVoe]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The manifestations of _V. vulnificus_ in this case are noted and it is unclear if the patient had risk factors for more serious disease. There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/226>.]
