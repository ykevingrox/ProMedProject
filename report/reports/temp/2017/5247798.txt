Radio Agencia Nacional EBC, Brasil [in Portuguese, trans. to Spanish Mod.JT, trans. to English Mod.TY]<http://radioagencianacional.ebc.com.br/pesquisa-e-inovacao/audio/2017-07/virus-transmissor-de-doenca-parecida-com-dengue-e-identificado-no>The results of the blood samples taken in 20 municipalities in Amazonas [state] indicate the presence of the virus of Oropouche fever. This has been confirmed by Fiocruz Amazonia in an investigation carried out together with state Health Surveillance.The sampling corresponds to the 2011-2016 period. In total, there were 306 individuals investigated, and there were 9 positives among them.The investigation gave negative results for dengue, chikungunya fever, and Zika viruses. These [were tested] because Oropouche fever presents with symptoms similar to those diseases transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. The disease [Oropouche fever virus] is caused [transmitted] by a mosquito (_Culicoides paraensis_) known colloquially as maruim [no-see-ums].The Amazonia Fiocruz Vice-Director of Research and Innovation, Felipe Naveca, explained that in case of an epidemic like the one the country underwent with Zika, the evaluation is usually clinical, which makes it difficult to identify other possible etiologies.In coming days, teams of technicians from the Amazonas and Roraima central laboratories will participate in a training course to use the method for detection of Oropouche developed by Fiocruz Amazonia. The expectation is that the project will be extended to other states in the country.[Byline: Michelle Moreira]--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[The questions are: Is the virus emerging? Is the capacity/interest in laboratory case research growing? In any case, if it has not already been, this arbovirus has a great potential to appear as one more challenge in the field of public health in Brazil. - Mod.RNA][Sporadic cases of Oropouche fever or outbreaks can be expected in areas in Brazil where the culicoid vector is present.As the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has noted: ""The Oropouche virus exists in nature in 2 cycles, the wild and urban-epidemic cycles. In the wild cycle, wildlife such as primates, sloths, and certain arthropods serve as reservoirs, with the [culicoid midge, _Culicoides paraensis_] flies acting as vectors. In the urban epidemic cycle, the infection cycle remains vector-human-vector, with humans acting as the principal hosts.""Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group. No vaccine is available, so avoidance of bites by the vector midge is the best preventive measure. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
