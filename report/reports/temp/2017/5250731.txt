CDC, Health Alert Network, HAN-00405 [edited]<https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00405.asp>Increase in reported cases of _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ infection, USA, summer 2017----------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), State and Local Health Departments, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating an increase in reported cases of cyclosporiasis.The purpose of this HAN [Health Alert Network] Advisory is to notify public health departments and healthcare facilities and to provide guidance to healthcare providers of the increase in reported cases. Please disseminate this information to healthcare providers in hospitals and emergency rooms, to primary care providers, and to microbiology laboratories.Healthcare providers should consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients with prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness. Testing for _Cyclospora_ is not routinely done in most US laboratories, even when stool is tested for parasites. Healthcare providers must specifically order testing for _Cyclospora_, whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Cyclosporiasis is a nationally notifiable disease; healthcare providers should report suspect and confirmed cases of infection to public health authorities.Background----------Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by the parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite; it is not transmitted directly from one person to another person. The most common symptom of cyclosporiasis is watery diarrhea, which can be profuse. Other common symptoms include anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, nausea, flatulence, abdominal cramping, and myalgia; vomiting and low-grade fever may also occur.Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range: 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of the parasite. If untreated, the illness may last for a few days to a month or longer, and may have a remitting-relapsing course.The treatment of choice for cyclosporiasis is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). No effective alternative treatments have yet been identified for persons who are allergic to or cannot tolerate TMP/SMX, thus observation and symptomatic care is recommended for these patients.Cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries but is more common in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Previous outbreaks in the United States have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce (such as, basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas). To date, no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated. In the United States, most of the reported cases and outbreaks have occurred during the spring and summer months, especially during May through August or September.As of [2 Aug 2017], 206 cases of _Cyclospora_ infections have been reported to CDC in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after [1 May 2017]. These cases have been reported from 27 states, most of which have reported relatively few cases. 18 cases reported hospitalization; no deaths have been reported. At this time, no specific vehicle of interest has been identified, and investigations to identify a potential source of infection are ongoing. It is too early to say whether cases of _Cyclospora_ infection in different states are related to each other and/or to the same food item(s).The number of cases (206) reported in 2017, is higher than the number of cases reported by this date in 2016. As of [3 Aug 2016], 88 _Cyclospora_ infections had been reported in persons who became infected in the United States and became ill on or after [1 May 2016].Recommendations for healthcare providers----------------------------------------- Consider a diagnosis of cyclosporiasis in patients who have prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal illness.- If indicated, healthcare providers should specifically order testing for _Cyclospora_, whether testing is requested by ova and parasite (O&P) examination, by molecular methods, or by a gastrointestinal pathogen panel test. Several stool specimens may be required because _Cyclospora_ oocysts may be shed intermittently and at low levels, even in persons with profuse diarrhea.- Report cases to local health departments. Contact the local health department if assistance is needed with reporting or submitting specimens.For more informationCDC cyclosporiasis: <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/>CDC cyclosporiasis resources for healthcare providers: <https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/health_professionals/index.html>CDC DPDx laboratory identification of parasites of public health concern: <https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/cyclosporiasis/index.html>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Infection with _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ is through the fecal oral route, but the mode of transmission is often -- as stated here -- fresh produce (such as, basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas). Previous outbreaks in the USA and Canada have been linked to products imported from Mexico.ProMED reported yesterday [14 Aug 2017] data from the UK published in Eurosurveillance, reporting 78 cases diagnosed in the UK after visiting Mexico, and a previous ProMED report from 14 Jul 2017, from a GeoSentinel center, reported a French tourist returning from Mexico with cyclosporiasis (see also below). - Mod.
