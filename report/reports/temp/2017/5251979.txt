Texas Department of State Health Services [edited]<http://www.dshs.texas.gov/news/releases/2017/HealthAlert-08142017.aspx>Health Alert - Brucellosis Contracted from Consumption of Raw Milk-------------Raw milk is milk from cows or other animals that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Brucella_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Campylobacter_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses and outbreaks.The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) recommends that people drink and eat only pasteurized dairy products (including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt). Pasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill dangerous bacteria. This is especially important for people at higher risk for foodborne illness: children younger than 5, pregnant women, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.Brucellosis----------Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It is a reportable condition in Texas. People can get the disease when they are in contact with infected animals or animal products, including raw milk, contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs, among others. Initial symptoms can include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, pain in muscles, joint, and/or back, and fatigue. Some signs and symptoms may persist for longer periods of time. Others may never go away or reoccur. These can include recurrent fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotum area, inflammation of the heart (endocarditis), neurologic symptoms (in up to 5% of all cases), chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver and spleen. Brucellosis in pregnancy is associated with risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature delivery, miscarriage, and intrauterine infection with fetal death. Neonatal infection may occur through transplacental transmission during a maternal bacteremic phase, from exposure to blood, urine, or vaginal secretions during delivery, or through breastfeeding.Laboratory diagnosis of brucellosis involves testing to look for bacteria in samples of blood, bone marrow, or other body fluids. Treatment consists of combination antibacterial therapy. Depending on the timing of treatment and severity of illness, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare, occurring in no more than 2% of all cases.Brucellosis Case Investigation----------------------In the course of diagnosing the cause of fever, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue in a Texas resident, blood culture results revealed that the patient was infected with _Brucella_. Through investigation by DSHS, the most probable source of the infection was determined to be raw cow's milk, which the person had been consuming. The source of the milk was K-Bar Dairy, a licensed raw milk dairy in Paradise, Texas.DSHS is concerned that other people who consumed raw milk from K-Bar Dairy may also have been exposed to _Brucella_ and became infected. Brucellosis may cause short-term and long-term disease. Without specific testing, this disease may elude correct diagnosis, and without appropriate antibiotic therapy, illness may persist.Recommended Action--------------------Health care providers should consider brucellosis among differential diagnoses when a patient presents with a clinically-compatible constellation of signs and symptoms. The patient should be asked about risk factors for brucellosis. A key question affecting the level of suspicion of brucellosis in this scenario is the patient's consumption of raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise Texas in Wise County since 1 Jun 2017. These individuals are considered to be at high risk of contracting brucellosis. Consumers are advised not to consume any raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy that are still in their possession and to discard them.At this time, it is uncertain how long _Brucella_ may have been present in the raw milk from this dairy. Testing is ongoing in an attempt to answer that question. If a patient seeks consultation because they consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy between January and June 2017, they should be advised to be watchful for signs of chronic brucellosis and clinically evaluated as appropriate. As a healthcare professional, we ask you to familiarize yourself with brucellosis, since it is an uncommon infection and can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms and signs that can wax and wane over weeks or even months. For these reasons, brucellosis presents a diagnostic challenge that requires the clinician to become familiar with the risk factors (e.g., potential exposure), signs, symptoms, natural history, available diagnostic tests, and treatment options.CDC has indicated that laboratory testing for this strain of _Brucella_ relies upon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish timely presumptive results and recovery via blood culture for _Brucella_ species confirmation. The strain of _Brucella_ recovered from the index patient in this case is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. The CDC is one reliable source for current information on _Brucella_: <https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/>.DSHS may issue additional alerts to aid the public and healthcare professionals as circumstances warrant.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Brucellosis is a disease that is thought exist since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See: <http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm>.The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughterhouse or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case.In Unpasteurized Dairy - USA: Infection Risk, 2009-2014. Emerg Infect Dis Volume 23, Number 6--June 2017 <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/15-1603_article>, the statement that ""unpasteurized products are consumed by a small percentage of the US dairy consumers but cause 95 percent of illnesses; the risk for illness was found to be over 800 times higher for consumers of unpasteurized milk or cheese than for consumers of pasteurized dairy products"" underscores the need to be critical about attempts by state legislatures to liberalize laws regarding the sale or availability of unpasteurized dairy products as reported, for example, in 2017 in:Montana -<http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2017/03/30/bill-label-raw-milk-related-products/99845984/>;Rhode Island -<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/03/rhode-island-bill-would-ok-retail-sales-of-unpasteurized-milk/#.WQS9bIWcFPY>; andHawaii -<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/01/hawaii-lawmakers-say-locavores-want-unpasteurized-raw-milk/#.WQS9uIWcFPY>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
