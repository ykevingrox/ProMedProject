Thai visa [edited]<http://news.thaivisa.com/article/5261/over-24000-of-mostly-children-afflicted-with-hand-foot-mouth-disease-in-six-months>Over 24 000 people, mostly children up to 4-years-old, were infected with hand-foot-mouth disease during the 1st 6 months of this year [2017] with one fatality, according to the statistics of the Diseases Control Department.Between 40 000 -- 76 000 people are infected with hand-foot-mouth disease each year during the past 5 years and 2 -- 3 people die from the disease annually. A total of 86.49 percent of the cases are reported in Bangkok followed by provinces in upper central region and upper southern region.However, Dr Jetsads Chokedamrongsook, director-general of Diseases Control Department, noted that the incidence of hand-foot-mouth disease was abnormally high in the past week [week of 18-24 Jun 2017] compared to the same period during the past 5 years.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[While the subtype of Coxsackie A virus is not stated in the report, Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16; Picornaviridae) is the enterovirus type most frequently associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in children. It is a common infection in children 1 - 5-years-old during the hot and humid season across East and South-East Asia. Severe disease and complications are mainly associated with EV71 as compared with CV-A16. Transmission of HFMD is increased in crowded and closed environments, including kindergartens and child daycare centers, where infectious droplets can easily spread via sharing of objects or surfaces (fomites).A time-resolved phylogenetic analysis conducted in Europe (France) together with HFMD surveillance data indicated that CV-A16 persistence is sustained by continuing virus migration at different geographic scales, from community transmission [as likely is the case in Thailand] to virus transportation between distant countries (J Virol. 2017 Jun 28. pii: JVI.00630-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00630-17).Thailand health officials had issued an advisory [in February 2017] after reporting increased numbers of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), mostly in children under the age of 5.See ProMED-mail Hand, foot, & mouth disease update (05): Thailand (SK) 20170623.5125187 and Hand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Thailand, Viet Nam 20170303.4875744 for a discussion of HFMD in Thailand.Maps of Thailand may be found at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151>. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151>.]
