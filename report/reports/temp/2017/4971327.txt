WGME [edited]<http://wgme.com/news/local/5-students-diagnosed-with-whooping-cough-in-yarmouth>According to Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 5 students have been diagnosed with pertussis, also known as whooping cough, at schools in Yarmouth. The Maine CDC confirmed 4 cases of whooping cough at Yarmouth High School and one at Yarmouth Elementary School.Whooping cough is spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing. Whooping cough usually begins with the same symptoms of a common cold like a sore throat and runny nose. It often develops into a severe cough after a few weeks. The cough can last for several weeks or more, according to the Maine CDC.To prevent the spread of pertussis, the Yarmouth School Department made the following recommendations: if you or your child has a severe cough, which may include coughing to the point of gagging, vomiting after coughing or difficulty breathing, or a prolonged cough lasting 2 weeks or longer, please keep your child home and contact your health care provider. If your provider suspects pertussis, they will obtain a specimen to be sent for pertussis testing.Children and adults with severe cough, prolonged cough or confirmed pertussis will be started on antibiotics and will need to remain at home for five days while taking these antibiotics. Check with your medical provider to be sure you and your child are up to date on your pertussis vaccine.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Yarmouth, with a population of 8349 residents, is a town in Cumberland County, in the US state of Maine, located 12 miles [19.3 km] north of the state's largest city, Portland (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarmouth,_Maine>).

School operations director Kelly Casaday said a weeklong spring break was already scheduled for next week. Classes will resume [17 Apr 2017].Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp says about 89 per cent of the school's 1400 students are vaccinated. That's below the 92 to 95 per cent that health experts recommend to protect a community. State law allows parents to exempt children from immunizations for medical or religious reasons or a personal opposition to vaccination.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Murray, with a population of almost 50 000 residents, is a city situated in Salt Lake County in the US state of Utah (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray,_Utah>).

The health department has directly contacted some families and RPS has contacted remaining families in the two buildings that were affected.The district released the following statement on [Mon 10 Apr 2017]: ""After communicating with the Douglas County Health Department, our staff immediately worked to meet or exceed their recommended response and share information with our families.

Maternal pertussis immunisation: clinical gains and epidemiological legacy. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(15): pii=30510. doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.15.30510------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------The increase in whooping cough (pertussis) incidence in many countries with high routine vaccination coverage is alarming, with incidence in the US reaching almost 50 000 reported cases per year, reflecting incidence levels not seen since the 1950s. While the potential explanations for this resurgence remain debated, we face an urgent need to protect newborns, especially during the time window between birth and the 1st routine vaccination dose. Maternal immunisation has been proposed as an effective strategy for protecting neonates, who are at higher risk of severe pertussis disease and mortality. However, if maternally derived antibodies adversely affect the immunogenicity of the routine schedule, through blunting effects, we may observe a gradual degradation of herd immunity. 'Wasted' vaccines would result in an accumulation of susceptible children in the population, specifically leading to an overall increase in incidence in older age groups. In this Perspective, we discuss potential long-term epidemiological effects of maternal immunisation, as determined by possible immune interference outcomes.Concluding remarks------------------Maternal pertussis immunisation is safe for both mother and infant [2,11] and is currently recommended in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Portugal, the UK, and the US, in response to the rise in incidence [2,18]. Its principal aim is to reduce pertussis mortality and morbidity in neonates. There is good reason to stress the direct benefits of maternal immunisation to both mother and infant. However, its potential adverse effects on routine vaccination efficacy and the subsequent long-term epidemiological legacy remain the subject of debate [11,12,16,17,20-23].Given these unknowns, mathematical transmission models can be instrumental in predicting the magnitude and time scale of potential effects of maternal antibody interference at the population level. Our recent modelling study [12] identified a trade-off between the direct protection of infants via maternal immunisation and the reduced indirect effects of herd immunity, leading to a gradual increase in incidence among older age cohorts.Ultimately, quantifying the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maternal immunisation requires a 2-pronged approach combining long-term clinical trials (such as the ongoing and recently finished studies in the UK, Canada, and the US [18]) with epidemiological and health economics modelling. Longitudinal clinical trials can resolve the immunological effects of MatAbs in response to routine vaccination. Furthermore, such research can shed light on the nature of any interference effect. Specifically, it is important to establish whether interference leads to an increase in vaccine failure, reduces the protective effects of the vaccine or affects the duration of protection [12,18]. By integrating information gleaned from clinical and immunological studies within epidemiological transmission models, the effectiveness of alternative strategies can be evaluated.[The full article, including the figure and references, is available at the source URL above.]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a discussion of pertussis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA: (CA) fatal 20150115.3093551 and my colleague Mod.LL's comments in Pertussis - USA (06) 20160917.4495935. - Mod.ML]
