Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/raccoon-roundworm-study-suggests-subclinical-infections-wildlife-rehabilitators-51749/>_Baylisascaris procyonis_, also known as the raccoon roundworm, is the most common and widespread cause of clinical larva migrans in animals. It is a ubiquitous roundworm infection of raccoons (_Procyon lotor_) and is emerging as an important helminthic zoonosis, primarily in young children._B. procyonis_ roundworms can cause potentially fatal neural larva migrans in many species, including humans. However, the clinical spectrum of _B. procyonis_ is not completely understood, according to researchers in a new study published in the CDC journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases.Wildlife rehabilitators may represent a population at risk for subclinical _B. procyonis_ due to frequent contact with raccoons and their feces, which may contain infectious larvated _B. procyonis_ eggs.During 2012-2015, serum samples were collected and analyzed for _B. procyonis_ IgG using a recombinant _B. procyonis_ repeat antigen 1 protein Western blot. A questionnaire was also administered to determine current involvement in rehabilitation activities.Nine out of 10 of the 347 participants reported current involvement in rehabilitation activities. 24 (7 percent) of participants tested positive for _B. procyonis_ antibodies.Based on their findings, researchers suggest that exposure to _B. procyonis_ may occur without clinical disease.
