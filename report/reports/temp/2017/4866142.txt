The demand and supply of bushmeat has held steady in Cameroon and throughout the south of Cameroon, despite health officials warning for about 2 years now that bushmeat trade and consumption increases the risk of an Ebola outbreak. In 2014, as the deadliest Ebola epidemic spread through 4 West African countries, including neighboring Nigeria, authorities in Cameroon closed the borders and began a massive campaign to shut out the disease. No cases were reported in Cameroon.But forest towns -- with their teeming fruit bat and wildlife populations, a huge appetite for bushmeat, and porous borders -- lie at the heart of what officials describe as a ""potential hotbed"" of Ebola.When fruit bats, which are believed to be the natural hosts of the Ebola virus, infect other wildlife, humans can pick up the virus from the secretions, blood or other bodily fluids of affected animals, warn health officials and organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The rampant consumption, handling and trade in game is easily the biggest threat to the Ebola prevention campaign led by the government and international partners like UNICEF, WHO and USAID in Cameroon, according to Dr Anicet Ntoude II, head of the regional disease and epidemics control service.]20 Feb 2017 Sierra Leone: Rebuilding health care in the shadow of Ebola<http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/blog/2017-02-20_Rebuilding_Health_Care_in_the_Shadow_of_Ebola/>[Sierra Leone, a low-income country, was recovering from the effects of a civil war when Ebola virus [Ebola virus disease] erupted in 2014. The disease decimated communities and devastated the country's already fragile health infrastructure.The epidemic in West Africa threw a harsh spotlight on the importance of strong health systems to tackle emergencies and improve global security by preventing future disease outbreaks. Countries with stronger systems -- like Nigeria and Senegal -- quickly contained Ebola. But in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, poor health services, a shortage of health care workers, lack of roads, and high illiteracy combined to prevent an adequate response to the crisis, which claimed 11 300 lives. Basic health services, including treatment and prevention for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus disease] and TB [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ disease] and malaria [_Plasmodium falciparum_ disease], ground to a halt.Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] also terrified the world with its speed and virulence. Sierra Leone hopes the experience of living through the epidemic can be used to prevent another outbreak by rebuilding and strengthening its health systems. The Global Fund and partners have joined forces to help Sierra Leone train health workers, improve diagnostics and supply chains, and increase awareness through community work.]Research----23 Feb 2017 Handwashing and Ebola virus disease outbreaks: A randomized comparison of soap, hand sanitizer, and 0.05% chlorine solutions on the inactivation and removal of model organisms Phi6 and _E. coli_ from hands and persistence in rinse water<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172734>[Citation.Wolfe M.K., Gallandat K., Daniels K, et al.

Handwashing and Ebola virus disease outbreaks: A randomized comparison of soap, hand sanitizer, and 0.05percent chlorine solutions on the inactivation and removal of model organisms Phi6 and E. coli from hands and persistence in rinse water. PlosOne. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172734> Abstract.To prevent Ebola transmission, frequent handwashing is recommended in Ebola Treatment Units and communities. However, little is known about which handwashing protocol is most efficacious. We evaluated 6 handwashing protocols (soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS), and 0.05percent sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high-test hypochlorite, and stabilized and non-stabilized sodium hypochlorite solutions) for 1) efficacy of handwashing on the removal and inactivation of non-pathogenic model organisms and, 2) persistence of organisms in rinse water. Model organisms _E. coli_ and bacteriophage Phi6 were used to evaluate handwashing with and without organic load added to simulate bodily fluids. ... Chlorine-based methods may offer a benefit of reducing persistence in rinse water. We recommend responders use the most practical handwashing method to ensure hand hygiene in Ebola contexts, considering the potential benefit of chlorine-based methods in rinse water persistence.]24 Feb 2017: Refining the paediatric Ebola case definition: a study of children in Sierra Leone with suspected Ebola virus disease<http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)30415-4.pdf>[Citation.

We collected data on children [aged less than 13 years] admitted to Ebola holding units in Sierra Leone to refine the case definition and describe outcomes of admitted children. ...-more---InterpretationContact history, fever, conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea are key characteristics for diagnosis of paediatric Ebola virus disease. The case definitions developed can be used flexibly--for example, for triage into risk categories to reduce risk of nosocomial infection.]26 Feb 2017: Nucleoprotein C-terminal domain from the Ebola and Marburg viruses<https://www.iucr.org/news/research-news/nucleoprotein-c-terminal-domain-from-the-ebola-and-marburg-viruses>[Citation. Baker L.E., Ellena J.F., Handing K.B., et al. (2016). Nucleoprotein C-terminal domain from the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Acta Cryst (2016). D72, 49-58<https://doi.org/10.1107/S205979831502143>Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus belong to a virus family called Filoviridae and can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa demonstrates the grave threat that these viruses pose globally to human health. While the EVD outbreak is slowly losing momentum, it is still unprecedented, resulting in over 23 000 cases and more than 9000 deaths by late 2015.Until recently, the nucleoprotein was one of 2 proteins encoded by the Ebolavirus genome that have not yet had their structures characterized. Since this protein is critical for the assembly and replication of the virus, it is recognized as a suitable drug target. Recently a group of scientists [Baker et al. (2016). Acta Cryst. D72, 49-58; doi: 10.1107/S2059798315021439] have shown that the homologous C-terminal domains of NP from 2 related pathogenic species of Ebolavirus, TaÌø Forest and Bundibugyo, have structures that are highly similar to that of a Zaire variant, in spite of differences in the amino-acid sequence. Interestingly, the related NPCt domain from MARV has a structure that is significantly different from the Ebolavirus consensus structure.Summary. The Filoviridae family of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses is comprised of 2 species of Marburgvirus (MARV and RAVV) and five species of Ebolavirus, i.e. Zaire (EBOV), Reston (RESTV), Sudan (SUDV), TaÌø Forest (TAFV) and Bundibugyo (BDBV). In each of these viruses the ssRNA encodes 7 distinct proteins. One of them, the nucleoprotein (NP), is the most abundant viral protein in the infected cell and within the viral nucleocapsid. It is tightly associated with the viral RNA in the nucleocapsid, and during the lifecycle of the virus is essential for transcription, RNA replication, genome packaging and nucleocapsid assembly prior to membrane encapsulation. The structure of the unique C-terminal globular domain of the NP from EBOV has recently been determined and shown to be structurally unrelated to any other known protein [Dziubanska et al. (2014), Acta Cryst. D70, 2420-2429]. In this paper, a study of the C-terminal domains from the NP from the remaining 4 species of Ebolavirus, as well as from the MARV strain of Marburgvirus, is reported. As expected, the crystal structures of the BDBV and TAFV proteins show high structural similarity to that from EBOV, while the MARV protein behaves like a molten globule with a core residual structure that is significantly different from that of the EBOV protein.]Funding----22 Feb 2017: Mark Zuckerberg gives USD 50 million to battle Zika, Ebola, other diseases<http://www.healthaim.com/mark-zuckerberg-gives-50m-to-battle-zika-ebola-other-diseases/73201>.The Chan Zuckerberg bio hub is a research center connected to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative under the Chan Zuckerberg Science program.
