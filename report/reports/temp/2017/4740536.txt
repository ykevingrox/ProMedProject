We have almost 99 percent coverage with regard to the diphtheria toxoid vaccine and there have been no cases of diphtheria reported to the Epidemiology Unit for many years. The moderator has failed to realise that vaccination does not result in eradication of the bacterium. _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ will continue to colonise and spread in humans, in any part of the globe, as it is unaffected by vaccination against toxin.As far as I am aware there are no statistics on the percentage of toxigenic strain in developed versus developing countries, so it is just an assumption that the toxigenic strain was acquired in Sri Lanka and not in Austria.--Dr Enoka CoreaConsultant MicrobiologistUniversity of ColomboSri Lanka<enokacorea@hotmail.com>[The report from Franz Allerberger and Alexander Indra of the Diphtheria Reference Centre, Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES), which ProMED-mail posted, presented a 60-year old Austrian who was seen at a hospital in Austria with ""signs and symptoms ""of cutaneous diphtheria due to a toxigenic strain in the tissues near a fingernail one day after returning from a one-month-vacation [23 Nov-21 Dec 2016] in Sri Lanka.The Allerberger/Indra report stated that ""travel -- and as previously shown migration -- to and from countries where diphtheria is endemic may still pose a risk for re-emergence of the disease, which emphasizes the importance of proper diphtheria vaccination,"" with the presumption that the infection was acquired in Sri Lanka.ProMED-mail thanks Dr Enoka Corea for pointing out that diphtheria is not endemic in Sri Lanka. In fact, with increasing vaccine coverage after the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was established in Sri Lanka in 1978 (<http://www.epid.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=426&lang=en>), no cases of diphtheria have been reported in Sri Lanka since 2001 (see figure 1, from reference 1 below and <http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencediphtheria.html>).Cutaneous infections due to toxigenic isolates of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ are characterized by chronic non-healing shallow skin ulcers, which can occur anywhere on the body, often associated with infected insect bites or trauma and frequently co-infected with pathogens such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322786/>). Systemic toxic manifestations are uncommon, even in non-vaccinated persons. Cutaneous diphtheria is contagious and can be a source of respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts. Acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur even in vaccinated contacts, since vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin, as mentioned by Dr Enoka Corea above.In the UK, all 17 patients with cases of cutaneous diphtheria due to toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_, reported from 1995 to 2002, were said to be related to travel to tropical countries where diphtheria is endemic (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322786/>), as were all 5 cases in Germany, for which clinical information was available (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3320432/>). The number of cases of diphtheria reported to WHO from 1980 to 2015 from various tropical countries can be found at (<http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencediphtheria.html>).In a study from Australia, 70 percent of patients with non-healing wounds from which mostly non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ were cultured were reported to have recently traveled to a tropical destination (<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jtm.12074/full>).In the US, 2 cases of diphtheria were recorded between 2004 and 2015. Cutaneous diphtheria, although no longer reportable to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, has been most often associated in the US with homelessness, poor sanitation, poverty, and crowded living conditions (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html>).Reference---------1.
