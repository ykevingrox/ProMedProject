The ministry investigated the incident after 5 hepatitis C cases emerged at Weilian Clinic in Taoyuan City. It later determined that needles used to administer treatment for the 5 infected patients were not disposed of but used repeatedly, possibly infecting 1200. The incident represents the first iatrogenic cluster of the disease in Taiwan.The ministry is urging patients who received jabs at the clinic between 10 Jun 2016 to 12 May 2017 to undergo health checks to determine if they were infected with hepatitis C. The Ministry said it would assist with treatment if necessary.Speaking at a legislative committee, Health Minister Chen Shih-chug revealed that the clinic not only reused needles, but also stocked expired drugs. Chen said the outbreak at Weilian was an isolated incident. Weilian will be shut down for the next 3 months and personnel connected to the incident will be subject to legal penalties. Patient compensation issues would be made in accordance to the law, said Chen.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[In addition to hepatitis C, both hepatitis B and HIV can be readily transmitted by reusing needles. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193>.]
