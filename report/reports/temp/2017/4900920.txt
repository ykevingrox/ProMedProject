Parramatta Sun [edited]<http://www.parramattasun.com.au/story/4522794/measles-warning-from-nsw-health/>NSW Health has alerted Sydneysiders to watch out for measles symptoms after 2 people returned to Australia from Bali infected with the disease.A Sydney resident and a Brisbane resident were on Virgin Airlines flights from Denpasar, Bali, to Sydney on 2 days last week. The Sydney resident also spent time at a pharmacy, medical centre and hospital in Auburn last week.[For details of their whereabouts and flights when infectious, see full report at URL above.]This is the 2nd measles warning NSW Health has issued this week and the 4th this year [2017].The total number of measles cases in NSW now stands at 8 for 2017. All NSW residents contracted the disease overseas.Sydney residents should be mindful of symptoms, particularly if they have not been vaccinated and have spent time in the places frequented by the infected people.Symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.NSW Health communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard said it was important to be vaccinated against measles, not only to protect yourself but to protect others through ""herd immunity.""""The risk of contracting measles is higher in certain overseas countries, and vaccination is your best protection against this disease, so it's important to seek advice from your doctor on the appropriate vaccinations to have ahead of overseas trips,"" Dr Sheppeard said.""The greater the number of people vaccinated, the greater the herd immunity, which helps to protect vulnerable people, such as infants under 12 months who are too young to have the measles vaccination.""Measles is highly infectious and is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If you or a family member experiences symptoms, it's important to go to your GP as soon as possible, as measles can have serious complications, particularly for young children.""Measles vaccine MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] has been freely available for many years for adults and children. Two doses of the vaccine are required for maximum protection for anyone born in and after 1966.[Byline: Kylie Stevens]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
