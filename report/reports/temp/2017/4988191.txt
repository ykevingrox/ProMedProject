""We are going to continue to give priority to the areas in which there is confirmation of virus circulation and the nearby localities,"" he stated.MaricÌÁ was one of the 65 municipalities of Rio de Janeiro state included in the list of priority cities for vaccination.Rio de Janeiro initiated a campaign on 25 Apr [Mar ?] [2017] to vaccinate the entire population in the city against the disease that is transmitted by a mosquito and in just in the 1st day about 212 000 people were immunized.The Rio de Janeiro municipal Secretariat advanced the preventive campaign after the confirmation of the 1st cases of yellow fever in Rio de Janeiro state that sounded the alarm.But the yellow fever outbreak that Brazil suffers since this past December [2016] is concentrated in states neighboring Rio de Janeiro, mainly Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and Sao Paulo.According to the Ministry of Health latest bulletin, issued 2 weeks ago, since December [2016] 604 yellow fever cases have been confirmed, with 202 deaths.--Communicated by:ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[This report was provided by Kathryn Soderholm <kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>][Brazil has embarked in a race against time, vaccinating the population in affected areas before urban cycles with transmission by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes can be initiated. So far, all cases have been attributed to spill-over from sylvan (forest) transmission. The quick response by health authorities so far has been successful in preventing urban transmission, but cases so near to a major population center such as Rio de Janeiro city, with abundant _Aedes aegypti_ populations, is worrisome.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
