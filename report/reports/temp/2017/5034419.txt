9 News [edited]<http://www.9news.com.au/health/2017/05/04/17/02/mosquito-and-measles-warning-in-wa>The Department of Health is reminding West Australians travelling to the north of the state to avoid mosquito bites.The mosquito warning comes after flocks of sentinel chickens in the Kimberley and Pilbara were found to have the Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and Kunjun virus.Sentinel chickens are used to detect the presence of diseases that may affect humans, with frequent tests of their blood used to assist authorities.in the Kimberley and Pilbara, 3 suspected cases of Kunjin virus have been detected in humans and will be the 1st human cases in the state since 2006 if confirmed.Both viruses are only carried by mosquitoes, and while the risk of being infected is low, the Department of Health says it is important to avoid being bitten.The Kunjin virus usually has milder symptoms than MVE, but rare cases result in headaches, neck stiffness, fever, delirium and coma.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Kunjin virus is endemic in Australia and human cases occur there sporadically, especially in wet years when mosquitoes are more abundant. As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment of 17 Apr 2010 (ProMED-mail archive number 20100417.1251): In the 8th ICTV Report Kunjin virus and West Nile virus are grouped together (as members of the West Nile virus species), whereas Murray Valley encephalitis virus is considered to be close to Alfuy virus (together forming the Murray Valley encephalitis virus species). Both species are members of the Japanese encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Australia can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.]
