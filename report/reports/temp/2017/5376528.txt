The minister, while giving the report on the public health situation in the country said so far, the country has recorded 10 cases of yellow fever this year: 4 cases in Kwara state, 2 in Kogi, 2 in Plateau, one in Abia and one in Edo state.He said the ministry will start a campaign in Kwara and Kogi starting from [Fri 13 Oct 2017]. ""We have also decided to start a nationwide vaccination [campaign] against yellow fever, we are going to bring that forward to December [2017] because of what is currently ongoing. We quite recognise the fact that we have a large number of Nigerians who are not immune to yellow fever and so we want to do a nationwide vaccination against yellow fever, he said.Mr. Adewole on the status of yellow fever in the country said there had been no report of new confirmed cases of the disease.[Byline: Ayodamola Owoseye]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report clarifies the current yellow fever (YF) case numbers and their localities. YF cases are more wlde-spread than reported in previous reports. Although the numbers of cases is not large, because, as the Minister indicated, a large number of Nigerians have not been vaccinated, the risk of an urban outbreak is significant. Health authorities are wise in initiating a YF vaccination campaign promptly. Urban YF can spread rapidly. Carrying out a nation-wide vaccination campaign is a formidable undertaking.
