Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-08/08/c_136509567.htm>At least 328 people have died of cholera in South Sudan since 18 Jun 2016, as rainy season threatens further spread across the country, the UN migration agency said on Tue 8 Aug 2017. Beldina Gikundi, International Organization for Migration (IOM), South Sudan Migration Health Emergency Officer, said rapid responses are critical to stemming the cholera outbreak that has affected the country for over a year.""In a country with mass displacement and severe levels of food insecurity, the effect of the continued cholera outbreak on the health of vulnerable populations is acute,"" Gikundi said in a statement released in Juba.The IOM agency said cholera outbreak has compounded already dire humanitarian needs. Approximately 4 million people have been displaced by the conflict that erupted in December 2013. According to IOM, more than 18 000 cholera cases been reported in South Sudan, noting that health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) teams continue to respond to the outbreak through case management and preventive measures across the country.Disease outbreaks are particularly dangerous for displaced and vulnerable populations, such as children under 5 years of age, who account for more than 1 in 5 cholera cases reported in 2017. ""As we saw the outbreak continue even during the dry season in 2017, we expect to see the trend persist throughout the rainy season, which leaves as much as 60 per cent of the country inaccessible by road,"" IOM said. ""Sustained and flexible responses are crucial to stemming the continued transmission of the disease in this extremely challenging context,"" it said.IOM said its team has repaired 84 boreholes, distributed cholera response kits, including jerry cans, water treatment supplies, and soap to more than 2600 households, as well as conducted water quality monitoring and treatment at water points and distributed soap and household water treatment supplies during hygiene promotion sessions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of South Sudan can be seen at <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/28_States_of_South_Sudan.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Cholera - Sudan (Northern state)Date: Tue 8 Aug 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-spreads-northern-sudan>Cholera has extended to the north of Sudan and reached Abri in Halfa locality [Northern state], where 4 cases were reported on [Mon 7 Aug 2017]. A hospital recorded more infected cases coming from the gold mines in Northern state. The patients are treated in the isolation ward placed outside of the health centre of Abri, a town along the Nile.A source reported to Radio Dabanga also on 7 Aug 2017, that 5 cases are being treated in Wadi Halfa hospital in Northern state, and in El Mahas in Dalgo locality, 5 people suffering from cholera were also reported to the health centre, bringing to the total number of infections the centre has seen to 70.Activist Wael El Imam told Radio Dabanga that the 5 new patients are all miners who work in the traditional gold mining sector in Dalgo. One patient, a miner, succumbed to cholera on [Sat 5 Aug 2017], in the hospital where a room has functioned as isolation space since last [Thu 3 Aug 2017]. People in Delgo (the main town of Dalgo) have continued to call upon the authorities to establish the cholera isolation ward outside of Delgo and in the mining areas, in fear of a growing rate of infections among residents. They threatened to prevent miners from entering Delgo. ""Authorities have not yet responded to them,"" El Imam said.Last week [week of 1 Aug 2017], activist Adham Nasir told Radio Dabanga that the hospital in Delgo received 34 new cases of cholera on [Thu 3 Aug 2017], raising the total number of infected cases in the ward to 77. Most of the patients are reportedly miners.In Khartoum, First Vice-President and Prime Minister Bakri Hassan Saleh instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Income Allocation and Monitoring Commission to provide financial resources to complement the efforts to combat cholera. Health Minister Bahar Idris Abugarda said in a statement that the total number of cases of 'watery diarrhea' in the country now stands at 123 people. Since the 1st reports of infections in Blue Nile state in September 2016, the Sudanese authorities have refused to make any reference to the disease being cholera, in disagreement with doctors, medical volunteers and civil society initiatives.Yesterday [7 Aug 2017], Abugarda said in a press statement that the containment of cholera is moving quickly as the health teams intensified their efforts to contain the epidemic, with continued monitoring and follow-up efforts. The current health situation is good all over the country, the health minister said, pointing out that schools and educational institutions are well protected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Sudan can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Sudan> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62500>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThe mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
