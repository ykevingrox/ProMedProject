Dirk Haselow <Dirk.Haselow@arkansas.gov> [edited]The Arkansas Department of Health is investigating all 3 recent _E. coli_ cases and has determined that the 3 cases are all unrelated infections without epidemiological or laboratory evidence of linkage to one another. There is no outbreak. The grouping in time appears to be an unfortunate coincidence.Of the cases; 2 are O157:H7 but have different PFGE [Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis] fingerprints. The 3rd is O103.None are currently related isolates involved in outbreaks reported to PulseNet.--Dirk Haselow, MD, PhDState Epidemiologist and Outbreak Response Medical DirectorArkansas Department of Health<Dirk.Haselow@arkansas.gov>[ProMED thanks Dr. Haselow for his prompt response to the RFI. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208>.]
