There were 3552 people infected Australia-wide last year [2016].Perth has had its wettest summer on record, prompting concerns that it could lead to a surge in cases of RRV and other diseases which spread when people are bitten by virus-carrying mosquitoes.The department said yesterday [1 Mar 2017] that while the number of infections in recent weeks had been average, mosquito numbers in some parts of Perth, the South West and other areas of WA were expected to increase because of extreme rainfall in the middle of last month [February 2017].A spokesman said the department and councils were managing mosquitoes in affected areas.The City of Swan, one of the areas in Perth hardest hit by rain last month [February 2017], issued an update this week warning of the continuing risk of increased mosquito breeding in flood-affected areas.While the council was treating affected areas, it said residents also needed to take precautions to protect themselves and their property.It said heavy rain could also increase stable-fly activity in the area and warned residents to remove excess hay and waste vegetable matter.Symptoms of RRV include painful or swollen joints, sore muscles, skin rashes, fever, fatigue and headache.There is no cure or vaccine against mosquito-borne infections. Health authorities advise the best way to avoid being bitten is to cover up when outdoors, particularly around dawn and dusk.People should also check around their home for containers holding stagnant water which could encourage mosquito breeding.[Byline: Cathy O'Leary]--Communicated by:ProMED-maoil from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Ross River virus (RRV) infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy, including in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia states. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.
