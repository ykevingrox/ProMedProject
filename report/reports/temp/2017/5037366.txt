The Hindu [edited]<http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/goa-doctors-not-sure-of-second-monkey-fever-death/article18449592.ece>The Goa Health Service authorities are unsure whether the recent death of one AG, 60, of Valpoi, North Goa was due to monkey fever or Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD).According to family sources, AG died on 29 Apr 2017 of KFD. However, Dr. Utkarsh Betodkar, epidemiologist of Goa Health Services monitoring KFD-related issues, told The Hindu on Saturday [13 May 2017] that according to medical papers of the patient, he was admitted for KFD fever around a month before his death at the Goa Medical College hospital and was discharged after he recovered.However, he was referred to GMC on 22 Apr 2017 and detected to have developed multiple medical problems, including high diabetes, and respiratory problems. What was shocking according to Dr. Betodkar was that he was discharged from the hospital after 24 Apr 2017 against medical advice. Therefore, Dr. Betodkar said there was no evidence to record his KFD as the cause of death.""We will not record it as a KFD death, but we will probe the case history,"" said Dr. Betodkar.As regards the death of VSK (67) of Banda-Sawantwadi (Maharashtra) at the GMC on Thursday [11 May 2017], where he was being treated for KFD, Dr. Betodkar said that they were yet to get this death also on record.The death of a 60-year-old woman at Mauxi village in Sattari was the 1st recorded KFD death this year [2017].Dr. Betodkar claimed that the spread of KFD this season was much less this year [2017]. Last year [2016], 284 cases were detected during the season, which ends with the onset of monsoons. This year, 80 cases have been detected so far, and the season is almost at its end.He reiterated that surveillance, vaccination, and monitoring were all going on in Goa.[Byline: Prakash Kamat]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an infectious disease caused by the Kyasanur Forest disease virus. The 1st KFD outbreak was registered in 1957; it affected inhabitants of Karnataka state, India, who were living close to the Kyasanur Forest. Although this outbreak did not claim human fatalities, a locally increased incidence of febrile diseases prompted epidemiological studies and led to the identification of a so far undescribed virus [Holbrook MR. Kyasanur Forest disease. Antiviral Res. 2012; 96(3):353-362].It is transmitted by ticks of the genus _Haemaphysalis_. Both virus and ticks are endemic to Karnataka state, India, and cases of KFD have been reported in this region as well as other states including Goa. There are high similarities between the KFD virus, the Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (isolated in Saudi Arabia) and the Nanjianyin virus (isolated in China).Presumably, several mammalian and bird species inhabiting the forests of southern India constitute the natural reservoir of the KFD virus. Ticks may feed on these species, become infected with the virus, and transmit it to humans. Besides humans, macaques and langurs are susceptible to the virus, and outbreaks are generally associated with high mortality rates in the respective non-human primate populations.As mentioned in the above report, there is no laboratory evidence to confirm KFD in the fatal case; however, the epidemiological data are suggestive that the patient had previously been diagnosed with KFD from which he recovered and was discharged. The clinical diagnosis at the time of readmission has not been mentioned. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/301>.]
