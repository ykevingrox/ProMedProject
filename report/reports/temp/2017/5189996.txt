Fox News [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/07/18/man-contracts-hantavirus-after-staying-in-cabins-at-california-park-family-says.html>A man was hospitalized with hantavirus, a rare and potentially fatal rodent-borne respiratory disease he may have contracted after staying in cabins at California parks, his family said.The man, 22, began having symptoms of the disease during the 4th of July weekend, his family told Fox 40. The family wrote on a crowdfunding page that they were camping at Lee Vining when he began having consistent headaches over 5 days. One day, he woke up with a 104 F [40 C] fever.""My mom and I insisted he return to Sacramento with us, not knowing how fast this was going to progress,"" the man's brother wrote. ""After a couple hours in the ER, vomiting began, and his lungs began to fill with fluid. He was quickly rushed to the ICU where he has now been for 9 days,"" he added.The man remains in critical condition as he continues to battle the rare virus that is usually spread through deer mice droppings. The 22-year-old worked as a tour guide at Bodie State Park in California, a ghost town about 100 miles from Yosemite National Park.The Department of Parks and Recreations has not confirmed that he contracted the disease during his stay at the state park, but his family said the guides knew there were deer mice in the cabins.California Department of Public Health reported that one person died in 2011 after contracting the disease during his visit to Bodie State Park.The family wrote an updated statement on Monday [17 Jul 2017] that the man is ""awake and able to communicate"" by writing on a whiteboard. He was breathing through a ventilator on Sunday [16 Jul 2017] due to fluid in his lungs.Since 2012, at least 10 people have contracted the virus after visiting Yosemite National park, Fox 40 reported.The virus kills more than one third of its victims but cannot be transmitted from person to person. --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It certainly is possible that the man acquired his infection in the park, since there have been previous cases acquired there.The hantavirus involved in this, and doubtless earlier cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. It appears that the case above was HPS, but he will probably survive it. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (<https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html>).Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus.
