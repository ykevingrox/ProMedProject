All are being treated for the disease, which is transmitted by the anopheles mosquito.In 2016 there were 2 cases of malaria in Petropolis, which is located in the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state and is a tourist destination due to its vestiges of the colonial era.The mayor reported that the sanitary surveillance team carried out an inspection and cleaning in the homes of and places frequented by the 5 men to identify possible mosquito breeding spots, common in closed forest regions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report was posted on ProMED-PORT on 26 Mar 2017 (see below). Petropolis is a mountain resort 70 km (44 mi) north of Rio de Janeiro located at an altitude of 825 meters (2707 ft) (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr%C3%B3polis>). The average night temperature in April is 15.7 deg C (60.3 deg F) and highest average day temperature 25.7 C (78.3 deg F) with winter approaching. Thus, the climate does not favor transmission of _Plasmodium falciparum_ and the malaria cases must therefore be _P. vivax_ if _P. simium_ is ruled out (reported by ProMED on 19 Mar 2017; see below).According to the country profile for Brazil in the WHO World Malaria Report 2016 (<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2016/WMR-2016-profiles.pdf>) this area is free of malaria. Thus malaria transmission here is something new. Molecular analysis of cases is needed to distinguish _P. vivax_ from _P. simium_. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10971>.]
