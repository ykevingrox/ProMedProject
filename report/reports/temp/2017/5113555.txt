WHO EDCARN Secretariat [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/edcarn/en/>WHO has launched a series of video courses on epidemics, pandemics and health emergencies. Geared for responders working in emergencies, the courses are also accessible to the public.The courses, which are on a platform called OpenWHO, transform complex scientific knowledge into easy-to-understand introductory video lessons, using a smaller bandwidth so that people in any country can access them. Offline versions are available on both Android and iOS devices.The platform can host an unlimited number of users and is free and open to anyone wishing to register.OpenWHO has 4 channels. One of the important channels is ""Outbreak,"" which focuses on diseases that are epidemic or pandemic-prone, such as Ebola, MERS, Zika, yellow fever, and pandemic influenza.Each course contains concrete knowledge and practical skills for our members and staff who are working in the field (e.g. infection prevention and control for viral hemorrhagic fever, ventilation management for severe acute respiratory infection). These courses will also be helpful to those who train medical workers in the field in epidemics and pandemics.In addition, this platform includes:- GetSocial!, which covers social science interventions such as risk communication, community engagement, and social mobilization.- Ready For Response, which offers courses on WHO's emergency response framework, Incident Management System and pre-deployment trainings for people who might be sent to countries for emergency response.- The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which provides them with the training necessary to participate in responses.All courses are in English, and many are also available in French and Arabic. To ensure that everyone involved in emergency response has the latest science and operational information, WHO makes some courses available in local languages and dialects during epidemics and emergencies.The video courses can be accessed here:OpenWHO: <https://openwho.org>.The mobile phone apps can be downloaded here:- Android app: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.xikolo.openwho&hl=en>- iOS app: <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openwho/id1183923481?mt=8>--Communicated by:Nicola Petrosillo <nicola.petrosillo@inmi.it>.................................................dk/msp/dk"
