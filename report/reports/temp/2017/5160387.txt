However in the last 6 months a number of people have suffered from severe complications.""This included some adolescent males who were treated in hospital for pain and swelling in their testicles, which in rare cases can result in infertility.In other cases, some females experienced ovarian inflammation and another person developed meningitis.Non-immune pregnant women who catch the disease risk miscarriage in the 1st 3 months. In rare cases, mumps can cause permanent hearing loss.With almost 70 percent of this year's cases occurring in those aged between 10 and 19, Dr Peters urged parents to ensure their families' free measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations were up to date.Mumps can spread quickly among those who are not immune, and one infected individual can cause an outbreak at a secondary school because immunity in that age group is well below the national average.""We are in the midst of an outbreak and already many students are scrambling to catch up on school work after missing school for several weeks,"" Dr Peters said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of New Zealand can be found at Healthmap <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>]******USA---[2] Massachusetts (Harvard college) alertDate: Fri 23 Jun 2017Source: Boston Globe [edited]<https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/22/two-cases-mumps-confirmed-harvard/ASaNehAgaSel6aY9lVhvXK/story.html>A total of 2 members of the Harvard University community have been diagnosed with mumps, according to an e-mail sent to Harvard students and staff.The infections were confirmed [Thu 22 Jun 2017] and coincide with several other mumps diagnoses in the Boston area over the past month, Dr Paul J.

See [4] below.From 1 Jan -- 17 Jun 2017, 44 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported mumps infections in 3562 people to CDC.Mumps is no longer very common in the United States, but case numbers vary from year to year; mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5833 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to under-reporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.See map of cases and figure with number of cases over years at <https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html> - Mod.LK]******[3] New Hampshire (Dartmouth College)Date: Thu 6 Jul 2017Source: Fox News [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/07/06/dartmouth-student-diagnosed-with-mumps.html>Health officials confirmed on [Wed 5 Jul 20917] that a Dartmouth College student has a case of the mumps and has been placed in isolation.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms can appear 16--18 days after infection, or up to 25 days after.

Those diagnosed range in age from 20 -- 41, may represent a change in the epidemiology of mumps in the state, which experienced a large outbreak last year [2016], as none has any known connection to higher education, according to the DPH.To date, according to the DPH, the majority of confirmed and probable mumps cases in the commonwealth have been among vaccinated college students and others linked to colleges and universities.It is believed most of the Latino individuals diagnosed since March [2017] have not been vaccinated, and none is known to have traveled internationally.MMR vaccination is highly protective against mumps and is recommended for children and adults,"" said Monica Bharel, the state's public health commissioner, in a statement.""In addition, those who have mumps should stay isolated at home for 5 days after their onset of swelling. Mumps is usually a mild disease but can cause serious illness. If you think you have mumps, stay home and call your healthcare provider.''The DPH alerted healthcare providers and local boards of health, in the Greater Boston area, to the outbreak 5 June 2017.According to the DPH, those diagnosed presented symptoms of mumps between 24 Mar and 31 May [2017], and included members of the Colombian, Dominican, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran communities. None is known to have traveled internationally prior to becoming ill. For the majority of the residents, vaccination histories are unknown; most are believed to be unvaccinated against mumps.DPH and local health departments are investigating the clusters of outbreaks and instituting measures to prevent further infection. Unvaccinated individuals are most susceptible to mumps infection.Mumps virus is spread through infected respiratory tract secretions. It can be spread within 3 -- 6 feet when an infected person coughs or sneezes or with direct contact with infected secretions, such as sharing water bottles.In 2016, according to the DPH, Massachusetts experienced a large mumps outbreak with 252 reported cases, which is more than 15 times the usual number of mumps cases. Those cases were part of a national mumps outbreak, which saw more than 5800 mumps cases, the largest number in a decade.So far this year [2017] the mumps outbreak continues in Massachusetts, with nearly 300 suspected cases of mumps investigated and 35 cases confirmed, according to the DPH.[Byline: Anne-Gerard Flynn]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
