The Morning Bulletin [edited]<https://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/mosquitoes-buzzy-infecting-rocky-locals-with-disea/3203125/>Mosquitoes have infected 112 central Queenslanders with diseases this year.NewsRegional analysis of Queensland health data shows 101 people living in Rockhampton and Gladstone were diagnosed with Ross River virus in the past 7 months.Last year [2016], 122 locals were found to have the disease.There are also 7 cases of the Barmah Forest virus but no reports of malaria or chikungunya, all of which mosquitoes spread.Across Queensland, there have been 1830 mozzie-borne [mosquito-borne] virus infections reported in the past 7 months, compared to 2462 for the whole of 2016.To control mosquitoes, Rockhampton Regional Council checks properties for infestations, mists adult mosquitoes, and monitors saltmarsh and fresh water areas with environmentally-friendly treatments.The council also has an ongoing education program to help residents reduce the pests. ""Due to our temperate climate and close proximity of the Fitzroy River, mosquitoes are a part of life here and Rockhampton Regional Council has a well-established track record of delivering effective vector management programs,"" the council's Planning and Regulatory Committee chair Cr Ellen Smith said.""At the end of the day though, it is ultimately residents who are responsible for the control of mosquitoes on their property. The council has placed a large emphasis on educating the community around best practice to control mosquitoes including reducing the number of breeding sites around the home and using measures such as mosquito nets, coils, repellents, and light-coloured clothing to reduce the risk of being bitten.""Ross River virus is Australia's main mosquito-borne disease.There is no vaccine and it costs the Australian economy more than AUD 20 million [about USD 15.9 million] a year to detect.The main treatment for the disease is anti-inflammatory medications.Queensland virologist Professor John Aaskov said infection rates could rise across our region. Prof Aaskov said transmission of the disease in our region was most likely human-mosquito-human rather than animal-mosquito-human.""At the moment, the only way to stop the disease is to cover yourself up and some of the sunscreens have mosquito repellents in them,"" he said. A pair of thongs, stubbies [shorts], and a singlet [sleeveless garment with a low-cut neck] are not going to protect you from mosquitoes. Really, all we can do is avoid getting mosquito bites.""Queensland Health urged those with symptoms to ask their doctor for a blood test.""Management of the illness generally involves treatment of the symptoms and most people recover without lasting effects,"" a spokesman said. ""Your doctor will advise on treatment for joint and muscle pains.""If diagnosed with a mosquito-borne disease such as Ross River fever, it is also important to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes so your illness is not passed on to someone else.""A new treatment for Ross River fever is being trialled in Queensland and Victoria.If successful, pentosan polysulfate sodium could be used to significantly reduce the duration and severity of joint pain caused by the virus that has infected 85 Central Queensland residents this year [2017].At a glance------------ Ross River virus is spread by mosquitoes from infected animals or humans.- Only female mosquitoes can pass on the disease.- It is prevalent in about 20 species of [mosquito].- Children who get the disease have less severe symptoms than adults.- Symptoms take 2-9 days to develop.- Symptoms can last for 40 weeks and include fever chills, muscle aches, rashes, fatigue, aching tendons, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, and extreme joint pain.- Once you have been infected you become immune to the disease.- It is diagnosed by a blood test.- People cannot spread the virus to other people.- The treatment is limited to pain killers and anti-inflammatories.- There is no vaccine available in Australia.[Byline: Sherele Moody]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This has been a very active Ross River and Barmah Forest virus transmission season. As noted in previous comments, Ross River virus [RRV] infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases also occur at times in New South wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring. Barmah Forest virus is also an alphavirus.Dr Steve Berger provided comments on background on Barmah Forest disease [BFD] in Australia abstracted from Gideon (<http://www.GideonOnline.com>) and the Gideon e-book series. Barmah Forest disease virus was first isolated from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_) in the Barmah Forest, Northern Victoria in 1974. Human infection was subsequently reported along the south coast of New South Wales during the mid-1980's; in Queensland during 1988-1989; in the Northern Territory in 1992, and in southwestern Western Australia in 1993. A new focus was described in Gippsland (Victoria) during 1993-1994. The number of localities reporting Barmah Forest disease increased during 1996-1998, and again during 1999-2001. Disease incidence has increased somewhat since 2000, with most cases reported from Queensland and New South Wales.Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285>. - Mod.TY]
