News24, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]<http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/plague-closes-2-madagascan-universities-20171005>Madagascan authorities on Thu 5 Oct 2017, ordered 2 universities to close temporarily as efforts intensify to halt a plague outbreak that has killed 33 people and caused widespread panic.The Indian Ocean island nation suffers annual plague outbreaks, but in 2017 the disease has affected urban areas, triggering concern from the WHO. ""In the fight against the spread of plague, the universities of Toamasina and Antananarivo will be closed for sanitation,"" the Ministry of Higher Education said in a statement. The capital Antananarivo and the port city of Toamasina have been at the centre of the plague outbreak.33 people are now confirmed to have died nationwide since the end of August 2017.The campus in Antananarivo is expected to reopen next week [week of 9 Oct 2017], though public gatherings in the city will remain banned. The outbreak includes bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, which spreads from person to person. Pneumonic plague can kill quickly, within 18 to 24 hours of infection if left untreated, but it can be cured by early use of antimicrobials. Long queues have formed outside pharmacies as people flock to buy face masks and medicine.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 6 Oct 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, WHO report [edited]<https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/who-briefing-notes-6-october>WHO briefing notes - 6 Oct 2017-------------------------------Madagascar----------- The World Health Organization (WHO) has delivered nearly 1.2 million doses of antimicrobials and released USD 1.5 million dollars in emergency funds to fight plague in Madagascar.- Plague is curable if detected in time. Our teams are working to ensure that everyone at risk has access to protection and treatment.- WHO has delivered 1 190 000 doses of antimicrobials to the Ministry of Health and partners this week [week of 2 Oct 2017], and a further supply of 244 000 doses is expected in the days ahead.- The different types of drugs will be used for both curative and prophylactic care. They are enough to treat up to 5000 patients and protect up to 100 000 people who may be exposed to the disease.- The medicines are being distributed to health facilities and mobile health clinics across the country with the support of the Ministry of Health and partners.- WHO is also filling critical shortages in disinfection materials and personal protective equipment for health professionals and safe burials.- WHO and the Ministry of Health are training local health workers on how to identify and care for patients, and how to trace people who have had close contact with symptomatic patients so that they may be given protective treatment.- Most of the 231 infections and 33 deaths that the Ministry of Health has reported since August 2017 are associated with pneumonic plague -- a more dangerous form of the disease that affects the lungs and is transmitted through coughing at close range.- Both bubonic and pneumonic plague can be cured using common antimicrobials if used early. Antimicrobials can also help prevent infection among people who have been exposed to plague.- WHO has rapidly released USD 1.5 million from it emergency funds to allow for immediate support to the country until more substantial funds are received.- WHO is appealing for USD 5.5 million to effectively respond to the outbreak and save lives.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This report cites 33 deaths and 231 cases, up from the 30 deaths reported 4 Oct 2017; Plague - Madagascar (10): fatal 20171004.5361339) when 194 total cases were reported. It is not stated whether any of the cases were thought to have been acquired on the universities' grounds.Newer plague vaccine candidates are now being evaluated including:- modified _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_:Demeure CE, Derbise A, Carniel E: Oral vaccination against plague using _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_. Chem Biol Interact. 2017; 267: 89-95; <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2016.03.030>Abstract--------""_Yersinia pestis_, the agent of plague, is among the deadliest bacterial pathogens affecting humans, and is a potential biological weapon. Because antibiotic resistant strains of _Y. pestis_ have been observed or could be engineered for evil use, vaccination against plague might become the only means to reduce mortality. Although plague is re-emerging in many countries, a vaccine with worldwide license is currently lacking. The vaccine strategy described here is based on an oral vaccination with an attenuated strain of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_. Indeed, this species is genetically almost identical to _Y. pestis_, but has a much lower pathogenicity and a higher genomic stability. Gradual modifications of the wild-type _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ strain IP32953 were performed to generate a safe and immunogenic vaccine. Genes coding for three essential virulence factors were deleted from this strain. To increase cross-species immunogenicity, an F1-encapsulated _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ strain was then generated. For this, the _Y. pestis_ caf operon, which encodes F1, was inserted first on a plasmid, and subsequently into the chromosome. The successive steps achieved to reach maximal vaccine potential are described, and how each step affected bacterial virulence and the development of a protective immune response is discussed. The final version of the vaccine, named VTnF1, provides a highly efficient and long-lasting protection against both bubonic and pneumonic plague after a single oral vaccine dose. Since a _Y. pestis_ strain deprived of F1 exist or could be engineered, we also analyzed the protection conferred by the vaccine against such strain and found that it also confers full protection against the two forms of plague. Thus, the properties of VTnF1 makes it one of the most efficient candidate vaccines for mass vaccination in tropical endemic areas as well as for populations exposed to bioterrorism.""- and an adenovirus-based vector:Sha J, Kirtley ML, Klages C, et al: A replication-defective human type 5 adenovirus-based trivalent vaccine confers complete protection against plague in mice and nonhuman primates. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2016; 23(7): 586-600; <http://cvi.asm.org/content/23/7/586.long>Abstract--------""Currently, no plague vaccine exists in the United States for human use. The capsular antigen (Caf1 or F1) and 2 type 3 secretion system (T3SS) components, the low-calcium-response V antigen (LcrV) and the needle protein YscF, represent protective antigens of _Yersinia pestis_. We used a replication-defective human type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) vector and constructed recombinant monovalent and trivalent vaccines (rAd5-LcrV and rAd5-YFV) that expressed either the codon-optimized lcrV or the fusion gene designated YFV (consisting of ycsF, caf1, and lcrV). Immunization of mice with the trivalent rAd5-YFV vaccine by either the intramuscular (i.m.) or the intranasal (i.n.) route provided protection superior to that with the monovalent rAd5-LcrV vaccine against bubonic and pneumonic plague when animals were challenged with _Y. pestis_ CO92. Preexisting adenoviral immunity did not diminish the protective response, and the protection was always higher when mice were administered one i.n. dose of the trivalent vaccine (priming) followed by a single i.m. booster dose of the purified YFV antigen. Immunization of cynomolgus macaques with the trivalent rAd5-YFV vaccine by the prime-boost strategy provided 100 percent protection against a stringent aerosol challenge dose of CO92 to animals that had preexisting adenoviral immunity. The vaccinated and challenged macaques had no signs of disease, and the invading pathogen rapidly cleared with no histopathological lesions. This is the first report showing the efficacy of an adenovirus-vectored trivalent vaccine against pneumonic plague in mouse and nonhuman primate (NHP) models.""- Mod.LLMaps of Madagascar can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/madagascar/mar2582r/madagascar_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
