ZNBC (Zambia National Broadcast Corporation) [edited]<http://www.znbc.co.zm/?p=47974>The Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock has partnered with the Ministry of Health to address the outbreak of anthrax in [Zambia's] Western Province. And 67 people are reported to be ill out of which 2 are suspected to have died from anthrax from November 2016 to [17 Jan 2017].Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya has since warned residents in the province to desist from consuming meat from cattle that died from suspected anthrax. Dr Chilufya says anthrax can claim dozens of lives if no stringent measures are put in place to contain it.Meanwhile Minister of Fisheries and Livestock Michael Katambo says his ministry is carrying out a mass vaccination exercise to contain the disease. Mr Katambo says government has since restricted the movement of cattle from affected areas to allow for their vaccination.The duo was speaking at a joint media briefing on the outbreak of anthrax disease in Mongu.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Clearly a diffuse number of cattle had died unreported of anthrax and were butchered and marketed. The only way to stop human cases of anthrax is to proactively vaccinate livestock in areas of high risk. When lacking the ability to GARP model the ecology [1], vaccinate all cattle within 5 km (3 mi) of known outbreaks. If there is any evidence for biting fly facilitated cases, make it 10 km (6 mi). But get the neighbouring herds vaccinated first.Stupidity plays a large part in the epidemiology of human anthrax, and there is no vaccine for that. And when there is a measure of rural malnutrition and meat is rarely eaten, the temptation to butcher a moribund animals is great. And thus the importance of livestock not dying from anthrax. 1.
