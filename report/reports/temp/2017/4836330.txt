South China Morning Post [edited]<http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2070197/town-southwest-china-culls-all-dogs-after-woman-dies-rabies>A small town in Meishan city, Sichuan culled more than 240 dogs after a woman died from a bite, the West China City Daily reports.The slaughter started on [Thu 9 Feb 2017], a day after it was confirmed that the victim died from rabies, authorities of Xiuwen town said. Law enforcement officers in gloves beat the dogs to death with long poles. The animals' bodies were transported to a disposal site by government staff wearing face masks.The woman, a dentist, was bitten by her own pet Husky in July [2016] and died in January [2017]. She refused to go to hospital because the dog had been vaccinated. She also feared the treatment might affect her pregnancy.The township government said 3 people have died from rabies in the past 8 years. Because about 20 percent of vaccinated dogs can still carry the rabies virus [see comment], officials decided to cull the entire canine population within 3 km [approx 1.86 mi] of the town.Rabies is carried mainly by wild and domesticated carnivores and bats. Exposure to rabid dogs is still the cause of more than 90 percent of human exposures to the virus and more than 99 percent of human deaths worldwide, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.Some animal rights experts voiced concern to the indiscriminative cull. The incident prompted discussions on mainland social media.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The above story lacks an essential piece of information: the fate of the (apparently vaccinated) pet husky which, reportedly, was the source of infection, killing its owner, a woman dentist, and 6 months after being bitten. Did the dog die? If so, when, and did it show any clinical signs?The statement that ""about 20 percent of vaccinated dogs can still carry the rabies virus"", which reportedly led officials to kill ""the entire canine population within 3 km (of the town?)"", is rather enigmatic. Is there suspicion of deficient vaccine applied in the region? In case confirmed, such deficiency may serve to explain both the rabies infection in the pet husky, as well as the exceptional (and controversial) decision to kill hundreds of (probably vaccinated) dogs.The 6-months long incubation period of the human victim is relatively long though within time limits presented in the literature. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
