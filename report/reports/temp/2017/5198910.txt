El Dia [in Spanish trans. Mod.TY, edited]<https://www.eldia.com.bo/index.php?c=Portada&articulo=Bolivia-registra-el-5to-caso-de-fiebre-amarilla&cat=1&pla=3&id_articulo=231264>The Director General of Health Services of the Ministry of Health, Rodolfo Rocabado, reported this Friday [21 Jul 2017] that the 5th case of yellow fever was registered in the country.He referred to the 1st registered case in Cochabamba that now was controlled. ""We have another case in Cochabamba. The total at the national level will be 5 cases. In La Paz [department], 4 are reported, one in Cochabamba. Historically, cases have occurred in Cochabamba, Beni and La Paz.""He recalled that in La Paz department, 4 yellow fever cases have been registered and lamented the death of a 9-year-old girl in Caranavi municipality (north part of La Paz).""We are taking action in the endemic zone. We have an epidemiological team that is working together with Departmental Health Services (SEDES). We are taking action, reinforcing our vaccination campaigns for unvaccinated people, because the teams are moving in these areas (Caranavi), and we are investigating the presence of the vector [mosquitoes],"" he said.Given this situation, Rocabado stated that they are continuing epidemiological surveillance to detect suspected cases and intensify control.""The alert will continue; surveillance is being strengthened, and this has permitted us to detect cases because we have intensive surveillance,"" he said.This past 14 Feb [2017], the 1st yellow fever case was reported in the La Paz department. This involved a Dane who visited the Caranavi municipality and was diagnosed with this disease. This obligated the Ministry of Health to issue an alert and reinforce land and air border control.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The yellow fever (YF) case count has now increased by one. These 5 yellow fever (YF) cases were doubtless due to spill over of the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission to unvaccinated humans rather than to _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission.Sporadic human cases occur in the Amazon Basin, including the Bolivian tropics, as spill-over from this sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Control of YF virus transmission within the forest cycle is not possible, leaving vaccination of people living in or traveling to endemic areas as the only feasible preventive measure. As implied in the above report, these 5 individuals almost certainly had not been vaccinated, a problem in the sparsely populated, rural areas in the Amazon Basin, where health services are not readily available. On [Mon 9 Jan 2017], a Danish tourist who came to Caranavi in the tropical area of La Paz department, Bolivia became infected with the virus [see Yellow fever - Americas (19): Bolivia (LP) 20170211.4832508]. Individuals residing in or traveling to these areas should be vaccinated at least 10 days before possible exposure to the virus.Maps of Bolivia can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5>, and a map of La Paz can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10123>. - Mod.TY]
