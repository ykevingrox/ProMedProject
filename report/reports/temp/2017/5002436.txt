MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6617e2.htm?s_cid=mm6617e2_w#suggestedcitation>Recent manufacturing problems resulted in a shortage of the only U.S.-licensed yellow fever vaccine. This shortage is expected to lead to a complete depletion of yellow fever vaccine available for the immunization of U.S. travelers by mid-2017. CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Sanofi Pasteur are collaborating to ensure a continuous yellow fever vaccine supply in the United States. As part of this collaboration, Sanofi Pasteur submitted an expanded access investigational new drug (eIND) application to FDA in September 2016 to allow for the importation and use of an alternative yellow fever vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur France, with safety and efficacy comparable to the U.S.-licensed vaccine; the eIND was accepted by FDA in October 2016. The implementation of this eIND protocol included developing a systematic process for selecting a limited number of clinic sites to provide the vaccine. CDC and Sanofi Pasteur will continue to communicate with the public and other stakeholders, and CDC will provide a list of locations that will be administering the replacement vaccine at a later date.DiscussionCDC and Sanofi Pasteur have worked to assure a continuous yellow fever vaccine supply in the United States after the anticipated complete depletion of YF-VAX in mid-2017. As the eIND protocol rollout begins in April [2017], Sanofi Pasteur will coordinate site recruitment and training, and CDC will help to resolve any problems that arise. Although the systematic site selection process for the distribution of Stamaril took into account site volume (giving preference to larger sites) and adequate geographic reach, accessibility difficulties for some international travelers might occur, because of the decrease in the number of clinics nationwide that provide yellow fever vaccination from 4000 to 250. CDC and Sanofi Pasteur will monitor for critical gaps in vaccine access and collaborate to address any issues, including considering the possibility of recruiting additional clinics to participate as necessary.CDC will notify state and territorial health department immunization programs about the Stamaril protocol. Information about which clinics will be eligible to receive Stamaril will be available to the public and other stakeholders, and discussed with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. CDC and Sanofi Pasteur continue to monitor the domestic yellow fever vaccine supply and will provide updates to health care providers and the public as new information becomes available.Updates regarding yellow fever vaccine and the anticipated complete depletion of vaccine stock will be available on CDC's Travelers' Health website at <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/> and Sanofi Pasteur's website at <http://www.sanofipasteur.us/vaccines/yellowfevervaccine>. Once available, CDC will provide a complete list of clinics where travelers can receive Stamaril at <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellow-fever-vaccination-clinics/search>.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Travelers planning to go to yellow fever (YF) endemic countries and travel clinics advising them need to be aware of the reduction in sites where the YF vaccine is available in the USA, starting in 2-3 months. Travelers need to be aware that they should receive their vaccination at least 10 days before travel in order to be protected upon arrival at their destinations.
