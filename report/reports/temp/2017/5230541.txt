Both cases are people who visited healthcare settings while they were infectious. This has prompted Public Health Wales to again warn that people with measles symptoms should not go into public waiting rooms.The Gwent area outbreak has been caused by the same strain of measles that has affected more than 14 000 people across Europe this year [2017] and which has killed 35 people. The new cases bring the total confirmed number in the outbreak to 12.Public Health Wales has issued the following advice:- Children with measles symptoms -- which include a high temperature, cough, runny nose, red eyes (conjunctivitis), and a distinctive red rash -- should be kept home from school, nurseries and social events such as holiday clubs and birthday parties.- Public Health Wales is also urging parents not to take children who appear to have symptoms of measles to the GP surgery, A&E department or hospital, where they could put other people at risk without calling ahead first.- Parents who suspect their child has measles should contact their GP or NHS Direct Wales for an assessment. They should alert their health care providers of the symptoms before attending any appointment.""We have already seen cases of measles in this outbreak that were passed between people in a waiting room, which shows how quickly measles can spread without needing to know someone who is infected very well or be in very close contact with them. We continue to urge parents not to take their children to any healthcare setting if they suspect they might have measles, but to phone ahead. Parents are also reminded that 2 doses of the MMR vaccine offer the only protection against measles, which can prove very serious and even fatal, and that it is never too late to catch up on missed doses."" - Dr R Stiff, Public Health WalesAround a 5th of children with measles can experience serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia or meningitis. One in 10 children with measles ends up in hospital - and in rare cases it can be fatal.For more information on measles, visit the Public Health Wales website <http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/43749>.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap/ProMED of Wales, United Kingdom can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/281>. - Mod.LK]******[2] ItalyDate: Mon 31 Jul 2017Source: I News [edited]<https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/world/italian-parents-vent-rage-compulsory-child-vaccines/>Members of Parliament [MPs] and doctors in Italy have been the victims of violent protests against a law that will see parents fined if they fail to have their children vaccinated. After the legislation passed through Italy's lower house of parliament on Fri [28 Jul 2017], anti-vaccine demonstrators assaulted 3 MPs outside Montecitorio. The 3, Elisa Mariano, Ludovico Vico and Salvatore Capon from the ruling centre-left Democratic Party, were rescued from protesters shouting ""killers"" by police officers.This morning [Mon 31 Jul 2017] it emerged that a man was arrested after allegedly assaulting a doctor in charge of the Diamante vaccination centre in the southern province of Cosenza. The man attacked the doctor after blaming a vaccination for an illness his child contracted, Ansa news agency reported.Dangerous measles outbreaks---------------------------The Italian government says obligatory vaccinations are necessary because the decrease in immunisation rates across the country risk is sparking outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases. Cases of measles, which can cause deadly brain damage, rose more than 5-fold across Italy in April [2017] compared with the same month last year [2016], health officials say. Many believe the vociferous -- and growing -- anti-vaccine movement has contributed to the increase. Italy was one of the countries where now discredited claims of a link between the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination and autism had a particularly strong impact.Fines if children aren't vaccinated-----------------------------------Under the new law, parents cannot enroll their children in nursery unless they have been immunised against polio, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B, _Haemophilus influenzae_ B, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox. Vaccination against meningitis B and C, pneumonia and rotavirus, are also recommended but are not compulsory.Parents face fines of 2500 EUR [about 2940 USD] if they fail to vaccinate their children by the time they reach school age. Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni insisted on [Fri 28 Jul 2017] that the law would ""raise the level of family health"". But protest groups such as No Vax have led demonstrations across Italy. Protesters have demanded to the right to withhold vaccines from their children because, they say, of the risks they pose.A 40 year old mother of 2 young children from Milan, who describes herself as pro-vaccine, hit out at the protests, however. She said: ""The availability of information on the internet has made people believe they know more than doctors. Scientific data has been disregarded for the advice of witch doctors and charlatans. These people are ignorant and dangerous.""[byline: Michael Day]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap/ProMED of Italy can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>. - Mod.LK]******[3] Finland (Savonlinna)Date: Thu 3 Aug 2017, 5:03 PM Source: Yle Uutiset [edited]<https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/fifth_measles_case_confirmed_in_eastern_finland_this_summer/9755940>So far, a total of 5 cases of the measles virus were diagnosed between the months of June and July [2017]. The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) confirms that all 5 cases are of the same virus type, which is good news for virologists. The 5th and latest case of a recent string of measles cases in the Savonlinna region was caused by the same virus strain as the others, THL reported on Thu [3 Aug 2017].""But this is still good news, because it means no new virus types have appeared in the region,"" says Mirkaleena ErkkilÌ  from the Eastern Savo health care district. ""We'll monitor the situation until mid-August [2017].""The 1st cases of measles started appearing in June [2017]. An Italian national from the Eastern Karelia Folk High School was the 1st carrier to be diagnosed. The man is suspected to have contracted the virus before arriving from Italy. The agency says that the small-scale epidemic is not yet over.About 95 per cent of children born in 2014 have received the MMR vaccine, providing protection against measles, mumps and rubella. Considering the highly contagious nature of measles, however, MMR vaccination coverage should be over 95 per cent of the population. Currently, the coverage remains under 95 per cent for 61 health centres, THL wrote in February [2017].ErkkilÌ  said he wanted to remind the public to be sure to keep up to date with their inoculations.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap/ProMED of Finland can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/118>. - Mod.LK]******[4] South Africa: GautengDate: 5 Aug 2017 Source: Platinum weekly [edited]<https://www.platinumweekly.co.za/article.php?id=706&categoryID=5>An unprecedented number of measles cases have been confirmed recently in Gauteng. It is alleged that the outbreak started with one specific family who refused to be vaccinated.This outbreak illustrates that even though all claims anti-vaxers use against vaccinations are scientifically unsound, there are people who believe in their cause and are refusing to vaccinate their children. Anti-vaxers hold that vaccines cause autism, are toxic and unnecessary as diseases like measles are not so serious. Some even claim that it's a racket to enrich doctors and pharmaceutical companies.During the 2008 and 2009 outbreaks, where 18 000 people were infected, several people died from the disease. Medical costs arising from treating preventable diseases are also very high.Due to of the seriousness of measles, Gauteng has started with emergency vaccinations of children, also giving boosters to children and adults who are already vaccinated.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap/ProMED of South Africa can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179>. - Mod.LK]
