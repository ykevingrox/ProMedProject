It seems unusual the milk would have an odor, possibly of a chlorine-like substance. Sour milk can be distasteful but chlorine would be quite distasteful and possibly harmful. However the 1st summary states teachers and staff also noticed the unusual odor.Vomiting and hysteria can spread through a group of students, but the addition of the diarrhea is not usually present in a hysteria event. Furthermore, with adults noticing the unusual odor, it seems there may be more than just a hysteria situation. - Mod.TGMaps of Japan can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/cities_of_japan_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2395>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2395>.]
