More than 1000 Guineans survived the epidemic, which lasted about 42 days with a couple of flare ups some months after the country was declared EVD-free. Most of them are said to suffer from depression as well as post-traumatic stress disorder, the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) reports. More are said to suffer from physical discomforts such as joint pains, chronic fatigue, and headaches. Despite their health problems, they can barely afford access to health care.""It is important that survivors and their families have access to quality care because many are unable to work and cannot afford to pay their own care,"" ALIMA said in a statement.][It is critical for West Africa and supporting countries to address both physical and mental sequelae of the Ebola outbreak, just as they would after a war. - Mod.LK]23 Mar 2017 New CDISC data standard aids development of therapies for Ebola virus<https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/iddo-ncd032317.php>[The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) and the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) announce the availability of a new standard to assist in the collection, aggregation and analysis of Ebola virus disease (EVD) research data.

The potential for exosomal VP40 to have a substantial impact on Ebola virus disease is examined in a [new] review article. The article is available free on the DNA and Cell Biology website until 13 Apr 2017.Citation. Pleet M., DeMarino C., Lepene B., et al. The Role of Exosomal VP40 in Ebola Virus Disease. DNA and Cell Biology. Feb 8. doi: 10.1089/dna.2017.3639Abstract. Ebola virus (EBOV) can cause a devastating hemorrhagic disease, leading to death in a short period of time. After infection, the resulting EBOV disease results in high levels of circulating cytokines, endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and bystander lymphocyte apoptosis in humans and nonhuman primates. The VP40 matrix protein of EBOV is essential for viral assembly and budding from the host cell. Recent data have shown that VP40 exists in the extracellular environment, including in exosomes, and exosomal VP40 can impact the viability of recipient immune cells, including myeloid and T cells, through the regulation of the RNAi and endosomal sorting complexes required for transport pathways. In this study, we discuss the latest findings of the impact of exosomal VP40 on immune cells in vitro and its potential implications for pathogenesis _in vivo_.]21 Mar 2017: Treatment with interferon may ease symptoms of Ebola patients<http://www.news-medical.net/news/20170321/Treatment-with-interferon-may-ease-symptoms-of-Ebola-patients.aspx>[A pilot study of a class of drugs used to treat hepatitis and some forms of multiple sclerosis has been shown for the 1st time to ease symptoms of Ebola patients, while also increasing their survival.Citation. Kader Konde M., Baker D.P., Traore F.A., et al. (22 Feb 2017). Interferon Beta-1a for the treatment of Ebola virus disease: A historically controlled, single-arm proof-of-concept trial. PLoS One <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169255> Abstract. To date, there are no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Based on our in vitro evidence of antiviral activity of interferon (IFN)-Beta activity against Ebola virus, we conducted a single arm clinical study in Guinea to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of IFN Beta-1a treatment for EVD. Nine individuals infected with Ebola virus were treated with IFN Beta-1a and compared retrospectively with a matched cohort of 21 infected patients receiving standardized supportive care only during the same time period at the same treatment unit. Cognizant of the limitations of having treated only 9 individuals with EVD, the data collected are cautiously considered. When compared to supportive care only, IFN Beta-1a treatment seemed to facilitate viral clearance from the blood and appeared associated with earlier resolution of disease symptoms. Survival, calculated from the date of consent for those in the trial and date of admission from those in the control cohort, to the date of death, was 19 percent for those receiving supportive care only, compared to 67 percent for those receiving supportive care plus IFN B-1a. Given the differences in baseline blood viremia between the control cohort and the IFN-treated cohort, an additional 17 controls were included for a subset analysis, from other treatment units in Guinea, matched with the IFN-treated patients based on age and baseline blood viremia. Subset analyses using this expanded control cohort suggests that patients without IFN B-1a treatment were ~ 1.5-1.9 fold more likely to die than those treated. Viewed altogether the results suggest a rationale for further clinical evaluation of IFN Beta-1a.]22 Mar 2017: Silence is golden: Suppressing host response to Ebola virus may help to control infection<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170322143226.htm>[The findings, which appear in the Journal of Virology [see citation below], could lead to new treatment options for Ebola virus disease.The Ebola virus is transmitted to people from wildlife, potentially bats, and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. Currently there are no licensed Ebola virus vaccines but two potential candidates are undergoing evaluation.Prior studies by others have shown the Ebola virus activates a defense program in macrophages through a process normally used by bacteria but not by viruses. The Ebola virus activates the macrophages through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Macrophages use TLR4 to sense bacterial infections and then activate a defense program evolved to fight bacteria. Unfortunately, activation of TLR4 by Ebola virus may lead the macrophages in the wrong direction and they mount an inappropriate immune response. This leads to the production of immune modulators that may be harmful and deteriorate Ebola virus disease.Using the Reston virus, a cousin of the Ebola virus, that does not cause disease in humans, researchers at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) examined how macrophages responded to Ebola compared to the Reston virus. Surprisingly and in contrast to Ebola virus, Reston virus-infected macrophages were not activated. In addition, the researchers found by using drugs that inhibit TLR4 activation, it was possible to keep macrophages that are exposed to Ebola virus silent.""We used transcriptomics analysis performed by our collaborators at the University of Washington, Seattle and other assays to look specifically at the inflammatory response in infected macrophages,"" explained corresponding author Elke MÌ hlberger, PhD, associate professor of microbiology at BUSM. ""This lack of activation in human macrophages might be one of the reasons why Reston virus does not cause disease in humans. More importantly, it showed that it is possible to keep macrophages that are exposed to Ebola virus silent by using drugs that inhibit TLR4 activation. This could be a promising treatment option for Ebola virus disease.""The researchers hope this study will allow for new insight for treating other hemorrhagic fever viruses in addition to Ebola virus.Citation: J Olejnik, A Forero, LR DeflubÌ© et al..
