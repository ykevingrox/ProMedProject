Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) can develop quickly and has a case fatality rate of around 30 percent. This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infection, nor specifies the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only 1 of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS.In the report above, no mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred. The croplands and food sources of the area, such as stored grain, attract the rodent host of Choclo virus. The preventive measures indicated in this and previous reports include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41718>. - Mod.TY]
