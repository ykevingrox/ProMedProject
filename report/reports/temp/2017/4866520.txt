In the Dominican Republic, from the beginning of the year to EW 2 of 2017 [1-13 Jan 2017], there were 7 suspected cholera cases and 2 confirmed cases reported, including 1 death.In 2016, 4 countries of the Americas: the Dominican Republic (1159), Ecuador (1)*, Haiti (41 421), and Mexico (1)* reported suspected and confirmed cases.In Haiti, in 2017 up to EW 5 [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017], a total of 1897 cholera cases, including 28 related deaths (case fatality rate: 1.5 percent) were reported**. In this period, the number of reported cases is lower than reported in 2015 and 2016. In relation to the in-hospital case fatality rate (CFR), it has remained around 1 percent since 2011. At the sub-national level, the departments with the highest reported cases in EW 5 [28 Jan-3 Feb 2017] in descending order are: Artibonite, Centre, Nord, Nord- Ouest, and Ouest (which includes Port-au-Prince). In the departments of Grand Anse and Sud, areas affected by the passing of Hurricane Matthew on 4 Oct 2016, there is a low level of suspected cholera cases and a declining trend since their respective peaks in EW 43 and 42 [15-28 Oct 2017], respectively.* Isolated cholera case, _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup 01, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor no toxigenic** Preliminary data subject to change as new information is received--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Prior to the 12 Jan 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the infrastructure supplying clean water in the population was tenuous at best. The earthquake destroyed much of the ability to deal with human waste and supply safe potable water. When _Vibrio cholerae_ was then inadvertently introduced into the country, the epidemic spread quickly in this population due to the lack of clean water in an immunologically naÌøve population and had continued over the 6 years since the beginning. Hurricane Matthew produced an exclamation point to the on-going epidemic in its wake as a dramatic exaggeration to the yearly increases related to the rainy season. The beat of this dismal epidemic goes on and will not stop until adequate funding is obtained to rebuild an infrastructure.
