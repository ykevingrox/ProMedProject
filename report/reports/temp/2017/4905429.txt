The New York Times [edited]<https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/world/middleeast/egypt-food-poisoning-3300-children.html?_r=0>More than 3300 children were hospitalized in Egypt on [Tue 13 Mar 2017], after an outbreak of food poisoning at several state-run primary schools, state-owned news media said. The mass poisoning, in the impoverished Upper Egypt province of Sohag, north of Luxor, was one of the biggest food-safety cases to hit the country in years. Officials suspect that school lunches may have been contaminated, and they have opened an investigation. Samples from the lunches, consisting of processed cheese cubes, dry sesame paste bars and loaves of bread, were being analyzed, they added.Children, most [of them] younger than 12, began vomiting within an hour of eating the lunches, Ahmed Nashaat, a Sohag lawmaker, said in a telephone interview. A total of 3353 children became ill, and at least 50 ambulances were sent to the schools, state news media said. Since then, all but 17 of the students have recovered and been discharged. No deaths or serious complications were reported.The ordeal revived complaints over the declining quality of Egypt's public education and health systems. ""It is ridiculous how this keeps on happening,"" Mr. Nashaat said. ""It is not hard to store biscuits and look at the expiration date."" The governor of Sohag, Ayman Abdel-Moneim, quickly suspended the distribution of government meals and demanded that changes be made to how they were stored and transported to schools.Tuesday's outbreak was one in a long series that have occurred in public schools and universities nationwide recently. Earlier in this month [March 2017], more than 214 students were found to have food poisoning caused by government meals at several schools in the provinces of Minya and Assiut.[Byline: Nour Youssef]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The short inoculation period and short period of illness suggest that the illness was caused by ingestion of preformed toxin produced by _Staphylococcus aureus_. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4048>.]
