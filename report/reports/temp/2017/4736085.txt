The Global Dispatch [edited]<http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/leprosy-cases-in-florida-at-18-half-in-brevard-county-16513/>The number of confirmed leprosy cases in Florida stands at 18 in 2016 to date [31 Dec 2016], down from the 28 cases reported in 2015, according to Florida Department of Health data. Like last year, Brevard County saw the most confirmed cases this year with 9, or half the state total. Volusia County reported 2 cases while Alachua, Bay, Broward, Clay, Martin, Polk and Seminole counties reported 1 a piece.175 new cases were reported in the US in 2014 (the most recent year for which data are available). Most (128 or 73 percent) of these new cases were reported in Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New York and Texas.Hansen's disease, formerly known as leprosy, is caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_ (_M. leprae_) bacteria. The infection has also been identified in nine-banded armadillos. Approximately 95 percent of people are resistant to infection; people who develop clinical illness can experience a wide range of clinical manifestations, but typically develop infections involving the skin, peripheral nerves and nasal mucosa.Although the mode of transmission of Hansen's disease is not clearly defined, most investigators believe that _M. leprae_ is usually spread person-to-person in respiratory droplets following extended close contact with an infected person, such as living in the same household.Research in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below] shows that the nine-banded armadillos (_Dasypus novemcinctus_), animals that naturally carry the leprosy bacterium, _Mycobacterium leprae_ and have been linked to zoonotic infections, have spread their geography to affect more areas of the southeastern United States.Leprosy is a chronic bacterial disease that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves and upper airway. Feared as a highly contagious and devastating disease, it is well established that Hansen's disease (leprosy) is not highly transmissible, is very treatable, and, with early diagnosis and treatment, is not disabling.Leprosy remains the most misunderstood human infectious disease. The stigma long associated with the disease still exists in most of the world and the psychological and social effects may be more difficult to deal with than the actual physical illness.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Reference---------Sharma R, Singh P, Loughry W, et al: Zoonotic leprosy in the Southeastern United States. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(12): 2127-34. <https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2112.150501>Florida leprosy patients are frequently infected with _Mycobacterium leprae_ strains having unique genotypes that are also found in _M. leprae_-infected Florida armadillos (<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/12/15-0501_article#tnF3>).It would be interesting to learn whether the 18 recent Florida patients in the news report above had contact with armadillos or contact with other leprosy patients in their households, whether genotyping _M. leprae_ from the 18 recent Florida patients reveals the same highly specific strains of _M. leprae_ found in Florida armadillos, or whether the patients had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions and, if so, whether _M. leprae_ genotypes reflective of that particular region were found to have infected these patients. Information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.A picture of the 9-banded armadillo can be found at <https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/images/mammals/armadillo.jpg>.The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.
