The Local [edited]<https://www.thelocal.ch/20171009/tick-related-meningitis-cases-on-rise-in-switzerland>The number of people contracting meningitis from tick bites is on the rise in Switzerland, according to the federal health office.Since the beginning of the year [2017], 214 people have contracted the serious viral illness from a tick bite, the SonntagsZeitung wrote on [Sun 8 Oct 2017].That's a higher number than in any of the previous 10 years.This year [2017] 2 people have even died from the disease.The increase in tick-borne meningitis cases is worrying the federal health office, which wants people to vaccinate themselves against the disease.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although this report refers to these cases as meningitis, they are most likely tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases. TBE is broadly distributed from western Europe to Japan. ProMED-mail has posted several instances of TBE in Europe this year [2017] and last (see 2017 and 2016 citations below). Health officials in the above report urge individuals to become vaccinated. The WHO states, ""Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious."" <http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/>Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105>.]
