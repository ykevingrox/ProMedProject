Of these 7 newly confirmed infections, 4 are mentioned to be asymptomatic infections of healthcare workers, presumably detected as part of contact tracing. 3 of the 4 healthcare workers were from Riyadh, and one was from Bisha in 'AsÇr region. Of the 3 newly confirmed infections in symptomatic individuals, one was classified as a secondary healthcare acquired case in a patient in Riyadh, and the remaining 2 were classified as primary cases, one with a history of direct exposure to camels and the other still pending investigation of possible high risk exposures.So it appears as though there is recent nosocomial transmission occurring in both Riyadh and Bisha. In Riyadh, there have been 4 cases (3 asymptomatic infections in healthcare workers and one symptomatic case in a patient), and in Bisha there has been one asymptomatic infection in a healthcare worker and one symptomatic infection in a patient.Since the beginning of May 2017, there have been 14 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia, compared with 8 newly confirmed cases in the 1st 19 days of April 2017.So, MERS-CoV is not going away, it is still being confirmed in Saudi Arabia. It still has nosocomial transmission, and there are still a majority of cases for which the transmission route remains unidentified.Maps showing the locations of the cases mentioned above can be found at the source URLs.
