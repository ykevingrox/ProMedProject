The ProMED-mail post rightly mentions the collaboration with international experts to build surveillance in Gibraltar. However we would like to set the record straight as experts were mandated by ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) through VectorNet activities (European network for sharing data on the geographic distribution of arthropod vectors, transmitting human and animal disease agents).Indeed a major action of VectorNet is to promote and support surveillance of invasive and native mosquito vector species in Europe. Therefore emphasis is put on capacity building in countries and regions where gaps in vector surveillance exist. Recent significant success outcomes are numerous. For example, in the Caucasus, VectorNet field missions demonstrated the establishment and spreading of populations of the major vector species _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ in both Georgia and north eastern Turkey in 2015 (Akiner et al, 2016). The latter species was also found for the 1st time in Armenia in 2016 (VectorNet field activity report, 2017). Later this year [2017], a mission will launch the survey in Azerbaijan. In the Balkans, _Ae. albopictus_ was found widespread in Bosnia in 2015, and locally established in FYROM [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] (2016) and in north Montenegro (2016). In Western Europe, the invasive species _Ae. japonicus_ was found by VectorNet experts spreading fast in France, from Alsace to the counties (dÌ©partements) Vosges (2016), Haute-SaÌ«ne, and Doubs (2017), and _Ae. albopictus_ could recently be detected in Gibraltar by local partners trained in 2016 and prolonging the vector surveillance.These VectorNet actions (<https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/disease-vectors/surveillance-and-disease-data>), together with the capacity building programme implemented by WHO Europe in non-EU countries of the European continent (<http://tinyurl.com/yc9q5q2v>) and with the national surveillance programmes implemented now in many EU countries are improving the preparedness of the continent to face vector-borne diseases.References----------1.

The efforts of the VectorNet partners in surveillance and capacity building are impressive. Their activities in EU and bordering countries is a good example of recognition that vector arthropods know nothing of international borders, making surveillance across broad geographic areas essential for preparedness, prevention and control. The success of VectorNet has gone beyond detection of _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. Their surveillance has also been tracking the spread of another invasive vector, _Ae. japonicus_. The VectorNet approach is a good model to adopt by other geographic areas at risk of arthropod-borne pathogens.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Gibraltar and several other countries mentioned can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/517>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Invasive mosquito - Gibraltar 20170827.52773022015----Invasive mosquito - Europe: France (VP) 20150823.3596512].................................................dk/ty/mj/dk"
