The Express Tribune [edited]<https://tribune.com.pk/story/1364901/chikungunya-engulfs-coastal-belt-karachi/>Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral fever, has now taken over the coastal belt of Karachi after its first outbreak in Malir district last year [2016].Thousands of patients have flocked to the hospitals but the Sindh health department and local government have been unable to provide relief to the victims. The Sindh government is still unable to test the suspected cases of Chikungunya virus, since it is still considering it a new and unknown disease. However, the 1st case was tested positive in December last year [2016] when the samples were sent to Islamabad.[A male, M], 20, a resident of Ibrahim Hyderi, told The Express Tribune that he has been suffering from severe joint pain for the last week with high-grade fever. Although, the fever is gone but his body aches due to the virus, which according to the doctors, is Chikungunya.Another victim with the same symptoms, GF, 40 remarked, ""3 members of my family had the virus earlier this month [March 2017] but the doctors failed to diagnose the disease. The hygiene and sanitary conditions in our area depict the worst picture but no government department seems committed to resolving the main issue of our area.""MZ, a resident of Keamari, a costal neighbourhood also talked about his miseries. He said a mosquito-borne viral disease has affected the residents of Keamari but the government has failed to announce the outbreak and provide relief to the victims as it was done in Malir district.According to a medical officer in the government hospital of Ibrahim Hyderi, the flow of patients with high-grade fever and body pain has been stabilized. Earlier, he said, hundreds of patients visited the hospital with a complaint but the doctors have no other option but to prescribe them symptomatic treatment since they do not have a diagnosis facility in Karachi.Karachi Health Director Dr Muhammad Tofique told The Express Tribune that the virus earlier affected a large number of people but it is under control now. However, he said, they fear the virus may spread again if measures are not taken to improve the sanitation conditions and prevent mosquito breeding by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar told The Express Tribune that they have been spraying regularly in all the areas.[Byline: Mudaser Kazi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Based on the recent report from the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU), from [19 Dec 2016] to [24 Mar 2017], a total of 960 suspected cases of Chikungunya were identified and registered using the WHO recommended case definition in the different towns of Karachi.
