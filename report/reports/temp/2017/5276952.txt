UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, Monitor-Uganda report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/uganda-viral-haemorrhagic-fever-alert>Uganda has been placed on high alert as the Ministry of Health investigates and monitors suspected cases of the deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in the central districts of Kiboga and Nakaseke. On [20 Aug 2017], the ministry received blood samples of 2 patients from Kiboga and Nakaseke hospital suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).According to a [21 Aug 2017] statement signed by the acting Director General, health services Dr Anthony Mbonye, the 2 victims tested positive to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCFH].CCHF is a common disease among humans and animals caused by caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_); the virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.Dr Mbonye says that the general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCFH among humans. The statement warns that while its symptoms do not appear in the infected animal, it appears in a very dangerous way in human beings.""You are required to work with the office of the District Veterinary Officer to strengthen measures against CCHF control in animals, implement interventions to reduce the risk of CCHF infections among humans, and interventions to control CCFH in health care settings.You are also reminded to immediately report and investigate any CCFH suspected cases in your district,"" reads the statement in part signed by Dr Mbonye.CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.According to Ministry of health, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians and that human-to-human transmission occurs from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies.Records indicate that since 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000, Bundibugyo, 2007, Luwero, 2011, Kibaale in July 2012, Luwero in November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007. More recently in 2012, 2 outbreaks of Marburg VHF have occurred in Ibanda and Kabale districts.Signs and symptoms of CCHF--------------------------Sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion.After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).[Byline: David Mafabi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north -- the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.The report above does not mention any clinical features of the cases.ProMED has not posted reports of cases of CCHF in Uganda since 2013. - Mod.UBAMaps of Uganda can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
