Many face stigma and discrimination in their families and communities, and thousands more face ongoing physical and mental health problems. Joint pains, fertility concerns, and eye problems, as well as livelihood and other economic issues, are daily ordeals for [EVD] survivors, according to research such as that carried out by the International Medical Corps in the middle of the crisis.In 2016, the UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] and the Government of Sierra Leone through the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs agreed on an Annual Work Plan to address these issues.Sierra Leone's Minister of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs is Dr Sylvia Blyden. On launching the project, she noted that ""Under the leadership of the UNDP and the Government of Sierra Leone, we'll have so many success stories out of this project."" However, the signing of this work plan has not so far changed the predicament of Ebola survivors.UAB is one of them. Among the 1st people to survive [EVD], UAB lives in an unfinished building in Goderich, west of Freetown. During the early days of the outbreak, UAB volunteered to work as a hygienist in a treatment centre near his community, where he contracted the virus. He remembers what it felt like living with the disease.""It was one of the greatest fears of my life. I saw infected people dying like animals every day. There were few survivors. 10 or 11 patients would come, and only one would survive. That was how severe things were. Seeing the hopeless situation of others made me think I was going to die,"" UAB says.When UAB was discharged, things were not easy. His family had already burnt most of his personal belongings and documents. ""Even my elder brother didn't come to visit me because he feared that I might infect him. I felt disappointed and very discouraged.""Though he survived both Ebola and the stigma that followed, UAB now lives with a medical complication called urethra rapture. The condition makes it difficult for him to urinate freely. He explains with tears in his eyes. ...][Byline: Abdul Brima][When the survivors of EVD, especially those who contracted the disease caring for others, continue to be stigmatized, that is a shame on those who conduct or condone such treatment. Education is critical to bring survivors back into the fold of the community. And now with the terrible news of torrential rain and mudslides in Sierra Leone, the community will need everyone pulling together to get through this latest tragedy. - Mod.LK]12 Aug 2017 Sierra Leone News: Training on human/animal interactions and disease<http://awoko.org/2017/08/11/sierra-leone-news-training-on-humananimal-interactions-and-disease/>[The Conservation Society Sierra Leone, with support from Welthungerhilfe [an organization for development and humanitarian aid] ended a 4-day training in zoonotic originated health diseases in Sierra Leone for community representatives from Gola Rainforest National Park [GRNP] Rangers and other stakeholders at the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Food Security training hall at Chinese farm along Wahman Abu Road in Kenema.The Biodiversity Officer for the Conservation Society, Papanie Bai Sesay, said the objective of the training is to develop, share, and apply knowledge and understanding on the prevention of zoonotic originated health epidemics in Sierra Leone. These diseases are relevant to broaden the knowledge of rangers, multipliers and community members in relation to wildlife and human interactions and early warning signs.Abdul Rashid, Program Manager Conservation Society, said zoonotic diseases include [Ebola virus disease (EVD)], Lassa fever, rabies, and monkey pox, [among other diseases], and that the training will enhance participants in knowledge of animals, sick animals and how to detect or spot strange behaviors among wildlife. Participants also learn about a strong reporting link between community members, multipliers, rangers and the GRNP/District Health Management Team (DHMT). [Rashid] maintained that participants will commit themselves to follow what they learned, and will strengthen relationship between communities and rangers. In addition, they will be willing to volunteer to take records of dead/sick animals in their communities for early warning systems for reporting.][This seems like an excellent approach to educate the community about veterinary health and serve as an early warning system. - Mod.LK]6 Aug 2017: Action follows 60 Minutes investigation questioning whether protective gear for Ebola was defective<http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-quarantines-its-own-equipment/>[The [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it has ""quarantined"" some of its own stock-piled equipment following a 60 Minutes report that questioned whether the gear, recommended for protection against the Ebola virus, was defective.The 60 Minutes story quoted former employees and internal company documents regarding MICROCOOL surgical gowns made by Halyard Health (formerly a division of Kimberly-Clark). The investigation first aired in May 2016 and was on the [US] CBS Television network.Based on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, 60 Minutes reported that MICROCOOL gowns were part of the US Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies for use in future outbreaks and emergencies. The stockpile is maintained by the CDC.In response to an inquiry from 60 Minutes, the CDC sent the broadcast a statement saying, ""The gowns are being quarantined within the SNS [Strategic National Stockpile] inventory and there are no current plans to use them.""]The CDC's full statement can be found at the URL above. ... - more]******[2] ResearchRNA persistence in semen------------------------3 Aug 2017: Ebola RNA persists in semen longer than 2 years<https://tinyurl.com/y9j62dq4>[Citation. Fischer, WA II, Brown J, Wohl DA, et al. Ebola RNA persists in semen longer than 2 years. Open Forum Infect Dis. 2017; doi:10.1093/ofid/ofx155; <https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofx155>Abstract--------Among 149 men who survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) donating semen 260-1016 days after EVD onset, Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA was detected in 13 (9 percent). Of 137 men donating semen 2 years after EVD onset, 11 (8 percent) had an EBOV RNA-positive specimen. The mechanism underlying the persistence of EBOV RNA in semen is unclear, as is whether the detection of viral RNA represents the presence of infectious virus.Background----------The well-documented sexual transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) by 2 men who survived the 2013-2016 West Africa epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) coupled with the detection of EBOV RNA in semen months after recovery from EVD has raised concern for the continued risk of sexual transmission of Ebola virus by asymptomatic survivors.][It is difficult to imagine infectious virus is not sequestered in a protected area in the male genital tract of those individuals who have RNA persisting in the semen for 2 years after exposure. Such prolonged presence of RNA will not help combat the stigma survivors are experiencing, discussed above. - Mod.LK][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of the West African countries affected by the 2014 Ebola outbreak can be accessed atLiberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>. - Mod.LK][See Also:Ebola update (34): research, vaccines 20170730.5216001Ebola update (33): research, vaccines, funding 20170723.5198911Ebola update (32): news, research, vaccine, funding 20170716.5179848Ebola update (31): news, vaccines, research, funding 20170709.5160324Ebola update (30): news, research, non-governmental organization, vaccines 20170629.5140988Ebola update (29): news, vaccine, research, funding 20170618.5113468Ebola update (28): DR Congo, Uganda, research 20170607.5090956Ebola update (27): news, vaccine 20170605.5083820Ebola update (26): news, research 20170529.5068444Ebola update (25): news, research, vaccine 20170524.5057906Ebola update (24): news, research, vaccine 20170521.5050743Ebola update (23): DRC, news, vaccine 20170519.5047049Ebola update (21): Congo DR, News, Research, VaccineEbola update (20): Congo DR, news, vaccine, update 20170515.5037761Ebola update (19): Congo DR, Nigeria preparedness 20170514.5035550Ebola update (18): Congo DR, vaccine 20170513.5034029Ebola update (17): Congo DR, vaccine, research 20170512.5031411Ebola update (16): news, research, vaccines, funding 20170428.5000661Ebola update (15): news, research, vaccine 20170416.4974553Ebola update (14): news, research, vaccine 20170410.4959931Ebola update (13): news, treatment, research, funding 20170402.4943034Ebola update (12): news, research, vaccine 20170326.4927435Ebola update (11): news, vaccine, research 20170312.4896304Ebola update (10): news, research 20170305.4881172Ebola update (09): news, research, funding 20170226.4866142Ebola update (08): news, research, vaccine 20170219.4850524Ebola update (07): research, economy 20170213.4836546Ebola update (06): research, treatment, funding 20170206.4819835Ebola update (05): news, vaccine, funding, documentary films 20170129.4801064Ebola update (04): research 20170123.4786222Ebola update (03): news, research 20170115.4767977Ebola update (02): news, research, vaccine, comment 20170108.4750411Ebola update (01): News, research, vaccine 20170103.47380602016----Ebola update (72): vaccine, research, NGO, media 20161226.4724859Ebola update (71): research, economy 20161218.4706276Ebola update (70): news, research, economy, funding 20161211.4690740Ebola update (69): news, NGO, research, economy, funding, vaccine 20161204.4675615Ebola update (68): news, economy 20161127.4657148Ebola update (67): news, research, funding 20161120.4642402Ebola update (66): news, research, funding, economy 20161115.4629793Ebola update (65): news, research, commentary, economy, funding, vaccine 20161106.4609611Ebola update (64): news, research 20161030.4595759Ebola update (63): news, research 20161023.4579436Ebola update (62): news, research, treatment, funding 20161017.4564066Ebola update (61): news, funding, economy 20161009.4547627Ebola update (60): news, research, economy 20161002.4531285Ebola update (59): news, research, funding 20160925.4514591Ebola update (58): news, research, funding, vaccine 20160918.4497393Ebola update (57): news, research, funding 20160911.4481043Ebola update (56): news, vaccine, research 20160904.4465145Ebola update (55): research, funding 20160828.4446844Ebola update (54): rapid test recall, nurse, research 20160821.4431433Ebola update (53): Guinea, research 20160814.4415032Ebola update (52): funding, research 20160808.4400521Ebola update (51): funding, research, miscellaneous 20160731.4383179Ebola update (50): Liberia, Sierra Leone, research 20160724.4366266Ebola update (49): Sierra Leone, research, history 20160717.4350351Ebola update (48): CDC, research, funding, economy 20160710.4336146Ebola update (47): Liberia, US preparedness, funding, research 20160703.4323924].................................................lk/mj/ml"
