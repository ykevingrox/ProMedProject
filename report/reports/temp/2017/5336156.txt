MPR News [edited]<https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/09/21/minnesota-probing-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-maple-grove>State [Minnesota] and local health authorities say they're investigating 2 cases of Legionnaires' disease in residents at the Silver Creek on Main assisted living facility in Maple Grove.The 1st resident's symptoms began on 22 Aug 2017, and the 2nd resident's symptoms began on 12 Sep 2017. Both residents were hospitalized and are recovering, the Minnesota Department of Health said in a statement on Thursday [21 Sep 2017].The state is working with Silver Creek to identify possible sources, and the facility has hired its own consultant. ""Available evidence indicates that the source of the _Legionella_, the bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease, is most likely within the building water system, though an exact source must still be determined,"" the health agency said.Legionnaires' [disease] is a type of bacterial pneumonia spread by inhaling water mist contaminated with _Legionella_ bacteria. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and coughing, according to the state Health Department. Most people exposed to _Legionella_ do not develop Legionnaires' disease, although people over age 50 and others who are smokers or who have chronic health conditions are at increased risk. It is not spread from person to person.Silver Creek's operators said Thursday [21 Sep 2017] that while the issue appears isolated to a ""small area of the property,"" and ""the risk to additional residents is minimal,"" the facility has closed its pools as a precaution and are advising residents to hold off on showers and use bottled water for drinking and brushing teeth.State officials said Maple Grove's water system is fine. ""This really has to do with the facility and their water system. The city of Maple Grove water supply is safe and meets water quality standards,"" said Kris Ehresmann, the Minnesota Health Department's director for infectious disease. ""The general public is not at risk.""Minnesota typically sees 50 to 60 cases in a year. The last major outbreak took place in 2016 in Hopkins. A beverage processing plant in Hopkins was identified as the likely source of that outbreak. 23 people were sickened in the outbreak. One person died. The disease was 1st identified at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maple Grove, with 68 385 residents, is a city in Hennepin County in the U.S. state of Minnesota, in the northwest region of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area.Silver Creek on Main is a community in Maple Grove, Minnesota for people 55 years of age or older, offering 106 independent living apartments, 41 assisted living apartments, short-term stay apartments, and studio apartments for those with memory loss (<http://www.silvercreekonmain.com>). The facility has a gym, including a multipurpose warm water pool, and ""HYDROWORXå¨1200"" aquatic therapy pool (<http://www.silvercreekonmain.com/silvercreek-main/health-and-fitness>). ""Hot tubs"" and whirlpool baths have frequently been implicated as sources for Legionnaires' disease outbreaks.However, the above news report fails to give details concerning common exposures to potential sources of _Legionella_ for the 2 cases of Legionnaires' disease in occupants at Silver Creek on Main, nor do we know whether the cases are infected by the same species of _Legionella_. Transmission pathways can be identified on the basis of matching genotypes for the clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_.More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354>.]
