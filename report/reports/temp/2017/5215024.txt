Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-h1n-idUSKBN1AC1XZ>Six people have died in an outbreak of H1N1 influenza largely hitting Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, a health official said on Thursday [27 Jul 2017] amid government efforts to track the spread of the virus known as swine flu.Two 5-year-old girls died on Tuesday [25 Jul 2017] at a children's hospital in Yangon, said Thinzar Aung, deputy director of the infectious diseases department at the Ministry of Health and Sport.She added that one man died on Wednesday and another on Thursday [26-27 Jul 2017] morning at other government-run hospitals in the city.Laboratory tests confirmed that all 4 people had contracted H1N1, she said. A pregnant woman and another man died on Monday [24 Jul 2017] after contracting the virus, also in Yangon. Aside from those killed by the virus, 30 people have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, Thinzar Aung said, insisting that the rising toll was not a cause for concern.Most cases have been found in Yangon, but 10 people were confirmed to have contracted the virus earlier this month [July 2017] in Matupi, in the remote northwestern state of Chin. An 8-year-old boy who died in Matupi with respiratory problems is suspected to have also caught swine flu.Health officials have sought to calm fears among the public over the outbreak, which has seen stores in Yangon sell out of surgical masks. They point out that H1N1 has been among the strains of flu circulating in Myanmar seasonally since a global pandemic in 2009, although deaths from the virus have not been reported in recent years.""We cannot say that government needs to control the spread of the virus because it is not at the level to control,"" said Thinzar Aung. ""These numbers are not big. It happens normally.""Myanmar's health system suffered from low levels of funding under consecutive military governments that prioritized defense spending. Funding has increased since a transition from junta rule began in 2011, but the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, which took power last year, faces a challenge to improve matters.The health ministry has called on hospitals and clinics -- as well as private health facilities -- to report any patients showing signs of influenza-like illness. Stephan Paul Jost, Myanmar representative for the World Health Organization, told Reuters he was ""generally impressed"" by Myanmar's initial response.""Clearly people are alert, and referral to a hospital in the local area would be fairly quick"" under the government's surveillance system, he said.[Byline: Wa Lone and Simon Lewis]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Data on the WHO Flu Net page indicate a rise in influenza A/H1N1pdm 2009 activity with nearly no cases reported in preceding weeks <http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/charts/en/>; the virus may have been in circulation with most cases mildly symptomatic and severe and fatal cases presenting within the last few days.What is important to note is that the fatal cases belong to the already described high risk groups for seasonal influenza which include:- Children younger than 5, but especially children younger than 2 years old- Adults 65 years of age and older- Pregnant women (and women up to 2 weeks postpartum)- Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities- People who have medical conditions including: Asthma; Neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions [including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability (mental retardation), moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury]; Chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and cystic fibrosis); Heart disease (such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease); Blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease); Endocrine disorders (such as diabetes mellitus); Kidney disorders; Liver disorders; Metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders); Weakened immune system due to disease or medication (such as people with HIV or AIDS, or cancer, or those on chronic steroids); People younger than 19 years of age who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy; People with extreme obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or more).The CDC recommends yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older by the end of October, if possible (in these inter-seasonal cases, use of vaccination will have to be evaluated). Furthermore, prompt treatment with antiviral drugs for people who are very sick or people who are sick and at high risk of flu complications is also recommended <https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm>. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/148>.]
