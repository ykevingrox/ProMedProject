A source said that in the bordering villages of Torsem and Mopa, 6-7 monkeys have been found dead.Local MLA and forest minister Rajendra Arlekar, along with officials of the forest and health department, inspected the areas. ""Without taking any risk, we have ordered the vaccination of the locals as a precautionary measure. It is yet to be established whether it is KFD. We have done the inspection of the dead bodies of the monkeys and have sent for biopsy, the reports of which are likely to be out in 5 days,"" local MLA and forest minister Rajendra Arlekar, who had inspected the area, said.""We have also asked all the government officials who are involved in the inspection of the dead bodies of the monkeys to take the vaccination,"" he said.Locals said that the monkeys have travelled to Patradevi (bordering Goa) from the forest areas of Banda in Maharashtra. ""We have also alerted the forest officials from Maharashtra to take necessary steps,"" Arlekar said. Arlekar also said that there has not been any case of KFD reported and that people need not panic.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), caused by a tickborne flavivirus, is seen in a limited area of India. It was first reported in the spring of 1957, when an outbreak of severe disease was documented in people living near the Kyasanur forest in Karnataka state, India, which also affected wild nonhuman primates.The vector is _Haemaphysalis spinigera_, a tick whose immature stages are avid primate feeders, including on humans. Ticks transmit the virus transovarially. Wild monkeys, _Presbytis entellus_ (black faced langur) and _Macaca radiata_ (red faced bonnet monkey), are very common in the forest localities where KFDV circulates. - Mod.PMBA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>.]
