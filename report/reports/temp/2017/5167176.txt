Salt Lake Tribune [edited]<http://www.sltrib.com/news/5497350-155/11-people-on-utah-arizona-line-have>A public health department on Tue 11 Jul 2017 said that the number of _E. coli_ O157 cases in Hildale, UT had increased to 11 and issued a warning to residents there about consuming raw milk and ground beef.The outbreak, which began in June 2017, has already killed 2 children. A 3 Jul 2017 alert from the Southwest Utah Public Health Department said 6 cases of _E. coli_ had been confirmed in Hildale.David Heaton, a spokesman for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department said that most of the cases are children. That has public health officials and physicians worried, he said, because this particular strain of _E. coli_ has been shown to cause kidney failure in kids. ""We're hoping the care these kids are receiving will prevent that,"" Heaton said.Epidemiologists are still seeking the source of the outbreak. Heaton said it's possible there are multiple sources or that the original patient contaminated other food or surfaces to spread the bacteria.The health department on Tue 11 Jul 2017 issued a warning to residents in Hildale and the surrounding area not to consume raw milk or ""previously purchased ground beef until further notice."" Heaton said that is a standard warning to help reduce the spread of _E. coli_; there's no confirmation those products have sickened anyone. Previous updates have said there was no sign of _E. coli_ in Hildale's water system.The mother of a 6-year-old girl, who died on 30 Jun 2017 from complications from _E. coli_ and who was sickened too, has said she suspects dirty diapers thrown in the yard of her housing complex in Hildale. A dog would tear the diapers open, the mother said, and some of the residents tried to clean up the mess. A 3-year-old boy who also lived at the Hildale housing complex reportedly died earlier in June 2017, 3 days after being taken to a Las Vegas hospital with symptoms including stomach pains and diarrhea, the mother has said. The boy's name has not been disclosed.Heaton said the health department is still investigating whether the diapers could have been a cause, but he added that the newest patients did not live in the housing complex.Hildale and adjoining Colorado City, Arizona, collectively known as Short Creek, are home to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The _E. coli_ patients previously identified had no connection to the church. It was not clear whether the new patients had church connections.[Byline: Nate Carlisle]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly, and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).References:1.
