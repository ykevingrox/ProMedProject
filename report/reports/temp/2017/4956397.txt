They are all in a stable condition after being sent to the commune's health center.""The main cause is likely the homemade soy milk because about 10 to 15 minutes after they drank it, they started displaying symptoms of food poisoning. However we're still waiting on the official results from the experts,"" Mr. Tith said. Provincial health department officer Voeung Bun Reth said a preliminary investigation showed the tainted soy milk to have been the cause, coupled with the fact that the recently-ordained monks had consumed it in large amounts as a food substitute.""Young monks aren't used to skipping dinner. So they drank too much soy milk after they were ordained yesterday morning,"" he said.""Once they are ordained, they cannot have dinner based on the rules of the religion, so they drank too much soy milk instead, which caused them to vomit. But now they're better and there is no problem."" He also urged anyone producing or consuming food products to pay special attention to food safety guidelines to avoid making consumers ill.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than 1 hour) suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper.ProMED would appreciate learning any additional information on the etiology of this outbreak.The location of Battambang province in central-west Cambodia can be found on a map at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battambang_Province#/media/File:Cambodia_Battambang_locator_map.svg> - Mod.LL]
