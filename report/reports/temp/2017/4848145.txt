Johnson TP et al. Sci Transl Med. 2017 Feb 15;9(377). pii: eaaf6953. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf6953.Abstract:Nodding syndrome is an epileptic disorder of unknown etiology that occurs in children in East Africa. There is an epidemiological association with _Onchocerca volvulus_, the parasitic worm that causes onchocerciasis (river blindness), but there is limited evidence that the parasite itself is neuroinvasive.We hypothesized that nodding syndrome may be an autoimmune-mediated disease. Using protein chip methodology, we detected autoantibodies to leiomodin-1 more abundantly in patients with nodding syndrome compared to unaffected controls from the same village. Leiomodin-1 autoantibodies were found in both the sera and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with nodding syndrome. Leiomodin-1 was found to be expressed in mature and developing human neurons in vitro and was localized in mouse brain to the CA3 region of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and cortical neurons, structures that also appear to be affected in patients with nodding syndrome. Antibodies targeting leiomodin-1 were neurotoxic in vitro, and leiomodin-1 antibodies purified from patients with nodding syndrome were cross-reactive with _O. volvulus_ antigens. This study provides initial evidence supporting the hypothesis that nodding syndrome is an autoimmune epileptic disorder caused by molecular mimicry with _O. volvulus_ antigens and suggests that patients may benefit from immunomodulatory therapies.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Nodding disease syndrome has remained enigmatic since the 1st link to Onchocerciasis was proposed in 1992 and 1994:""(Kipp W et al.

The results are in line with a previous study finding a link between onchocerciasis exposure, lack of ivermectin treatment and NS (Risk factors for epilepsy in Bas-Uele Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo: a case-control study.
