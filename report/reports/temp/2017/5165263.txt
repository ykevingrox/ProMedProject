Conjunctivitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, or toxins (such as chlorine in swimming pool water).A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis. A mucopurulent or purulent discharge, often associated with morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids, strongly suggests a bacterial infection. Pain, photophobia, or blurred vision suggests a more serious disease process such as keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea.As mentioned in the report above, there has been an increase in the number of conjunctivitis cases in Colon province of Panama, but the specific clinical features or diagnostic data are unavailable, so inference to the cause is difficult. - Mod.UBAMaps of Panama can be seen at <http://www.d-maps.com/m/america/panama/panama74.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4709>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
