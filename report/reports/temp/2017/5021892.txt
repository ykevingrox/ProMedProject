SWI [edited]<http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-cow_anthrax-infection-case-identified-in-canton-jura/43166464>Authorities in the Swiss canton of Jura have identified a case of anthrax in a cow that died suddenly. The last such case in Switzerland dates back to 1997.The cantonal authorities have cordoned off the farm and the pasture where the infected cow was found dead last week in northwestern Switzerland. All persons who have had any contact with the infected animal have been informed and asked to contact their doctor.The last Swiss case was documented in canton Schwyz in 1997, and canton Jura last reported an infection in 1993. Jura veterinary and public health officials are working closely together to monitor any other cases.Anthrax is caused by a bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_, which survives in the environment by forming spores. Cattle get infected by consuming spores from water or fodder contaminated by the faeces or blood of infected animals. Anthrax can spread from animals to humans, and those working with animals or animal products are most at risk. The most common form of the disease is skin anthrax, when spores enter the skin through cuts or abrasions and cause a black sore.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] OIE WAHIDDate: 8 May 2017Source: OIE [edited]<http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=23717>Anthrax - Switzerland-------------------Information received on 8 May 2017 from Mr Hans Wyss, Chief Veterinary Officer, Schwarzenburgstrasse 161, Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, Liebefeld Berne, SwitzerlandSummary:Report type: Immediate notificationDate of start of the event: 29 Apr 2017Date of confirmation of the event: 05 May 2017Report date: 8 May 2017Date submitted to OIE: 8 May 2017Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed diseaseDate of previous occurrence: August 1997Manifestation of disease: Clinical diseaseCausal agent: _Bacillus anthracis_Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced), NecropsyThis event pertains to the whole country.New outbreaks (1)Outbreak 1 (Anthrax_2017_1): Villars-sur-Fontenais, Porrentruy, Fontenais, JuraDate of start of the outbreak: 29 Apr 2017Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)Epidemiological unit: FarmAffected animals:Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / SlaughteredCattle / 80 / 1 / 1 / - / - /Affected population: Two other animals with fever.

Previously, there had been a case in 1993, 2 in 1989, and one in 1988. There was a human case in 2014, but this was in a tourist returning from visiting family in Turkey, so it will be very interesting to see what the Swiss authorities discover about this bovine case in Jura.It is plotted in the OIE report, and it is very close to the western border with France. Genomics will say whether it is a French strain or whether someone dug up the 1997 carcass. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105>.]
