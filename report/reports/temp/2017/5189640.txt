Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/vibriosis-outbreak-in-seattle-up-to-25-people-may-have-become-ill-62523/>In a follow-up to a report last week [week of 10 Jul 2017] concerning a _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ outbreak linked to raw oyster consumption in Seattle, Washington, Public Health -- Seattle & King County officials say as many as 25 people may have become ill since early June 2017.The health department investigation is looking at multiple reports of persons ill with watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting --symptoms consistent with vibriosis -- after eating raw oysters from one of several restaurants and markets in King County.For each retail/restaurant location reported, Environmental Health inspectors conducted on site investigations to ensure that the oysters were from approved sources, being cold held properly (at refrigeration temperatures at or below 41 deg F [5 deg C]) and handled in such a way to minimize the risk of cross-contaminations (where bacteria from one bad oyster could be spread to a whole batch, or to other foods). The _Vibrio_ bacterium is naturally found in salty, brackish waters where oysters are grown. Therefore, while temperature violations before and after delivery to restaurants can contribute to the growth of _Vibrio_, the restaurants are not the direct source of _Vibrio_ in oysters.According to Public Health -- Seattle & King County epidemiologist, Jenny Lloyd: To minimize the risk of _Vibrio_ infection, practice safe shellfish preparation (such as keeping shellfish cold (less than 41 deg F [5 deg C]) and cook shellfish thoroughly, following these guidelines. People who take antacids, have suppressed immune systems, or some other chronic health conditions are more likely to get sick and should consider avoiding raw oyster consumption.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Eating locally acquired raw shellfish only during months containing an ""r"" in its name may decrease infection transmission during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the Northern Hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming is truly occurring, this pathogen and others are occurring in areas previously not seeing it and with shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore.Successful isolation of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ from diarrheic stools must start with consideration of this particular organism, as _Vibrio_ spp. and a number of organisms, including the enteropaths of _E. coli_, require special media to either facilitate growth (_Vibrio_ spp. require higher salinity and are referred to as halophilic) or aid to identification (_E. coli_ O157 can be screened for using its lack of fermentation of sorbitol). With the availability of DNA screening panels for stool, non-cultural diagnostic methodology is being much more commonly used. - Mod.LLThe state of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4512>.
