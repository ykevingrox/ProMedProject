ClarÌ n [in Spanish, trans.

The health region confirmed the death of this woman this noon [Fri 3 Feb 2017], whose identity was not revealed, but stated that she was from Mendoza and was on vacation together with her son in Sauce Grande, located some 7 km [4.3 mi] from the Buenos Aires spa center.Oscar Bonino, head of the Ministry of Health unit in the southwest of Buenos Aires province, said that most likely the woman had contracted the disease during her stay in this summer resort center.""About a month ago she was in Sauce Grande and the incubation period of the disease is 2 - 6 weeks,"" stated the physician who indicated that the victim had a medical visit for malaise this past [Mon 30 Jan 2017] in a Monte Hermoso hospital,""They examined her, carried out tests and radiographs, but did not find anything abnormal. Few hours later, she felt worse and immediately was sent to Bahia Blanca,"" the professional said. Although she was admitted in intensive care and the image indicated respiratory insufficiency, ""In just a few hours she went into irreversible shock and died,"" said Bonino about the fatal outcome of today's case.He added that postmortem samples were taken and sent to the Malbran Institute where the hantavirus [infection] diagnosis was confirmed. ""This is a zoonosis, a disease in which the virus is transmitted through the excreta, urine and saliva of a rodent, most frequently the pygmy long-tailed rat which is mostly distributed in the Andean zone, but which is found from the north to the south of the country,"" the physician added.""There is the possibility that she might have contracted the virus in Mendoza, but being within the limits of the incubation period, as is the case of this woman, we are working with the hypothesis that it began in Sauce Grande,"" Bonino added.He remarked that in 99 percent of the cases the transmission is from the rodent to the person, so it was recommended that follow up be made with the son of the victim, who in coming hours will return to Mendoza with the former spouse of the woman, who traveled to Monte Hermoso to arrange for the shipment of the body.[Byline: Gabriel BermÌ¼dez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>There is no indication of the specific hantavirus involved in these cases or previous ones in Buenos Aires province in 2016, nor is there mention of the specific circumstances under which the woman reported above acquired her infection.Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 6 years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these recent Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, while the case acquired in Buenos Aires or Mendoza provinces may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at <http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg>.A map of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.zonu.com/argentina_maps/Argentina_Regions_Map_2.htm>, and at<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/723>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53505>.]******[2] La AraucanÌ a region, ChileDate: Thu 2 Feb 2017Source: Bio Bio Chile [in Spanish, trans.

This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and this only occurs with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at<http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57414>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54750>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>.]
