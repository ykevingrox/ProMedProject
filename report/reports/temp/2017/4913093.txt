The New Indian Express, Express News Service [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/mar/19/anthrax-scare-in-bisra-1583087.html>At least 5 villagers, suffering from anthrax, have been admitted to Rourkela Government Hospital (RGH) [Odisha] and 3 others were discharged even as veterinarians are worried over death of cattle and goats due to the disease in Bisra block of Sundargarh district.A week back, villagers of Birkera under Bisra block of the district had consumed beef after death of a cow. Subsequently, those who had handled the carcass and removed the skin started showing symptoms of anthrax. Sundargarh Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) BK Naik said 5 persons with ulcers in their bodies are undergoing treatment for anthrax at the RGH, while 3 others were discharged.He said all the 8 were involved in handling of the cow carcass. As a preventive measure, 163 villagers, who had consumed beef, were on [Fri 17 Mar 2017] given contact doses. He said a medical team visited the affected village on [Sat 18 Mar 2017] and no fresh case was reported.Surveillance would continue for a week, he said, adding that 2 persons of the village on [Fri 17 Mar 2017] died of reasons other than anthrax. At the RGH, [2 farmers] said they contracted the disease while burying severed body parts of cows.Meanwhile, 5 cattle and 7 goats had died at Birkera village, while 4 cattle were reported dead at Dhatkidihi village of Jareikela panchayat of the same block. Sundargarh Chief District Veterinary Officer (CDVO) D K Patnaik visited the 2 villages on [Sat 18 Mar 2017] to take stock of the situation. He said blood samples of the dead animals have been collected to ascertain the exact cause of death. ""It would be too early to say the animals were suffering from anthrax. 8 ill cows at Birkera are responding well to treatment,"" he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59012>. For a description and map of Sundergarh go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundergarh_district>.Dr Patnaik is correct in being cautious. While it is possible to successfully treat cattle suffering from anthrax it is not usually attempted and most successes come from treating incubating cases. And one must admit that there are a number of other diseases known to kill cattle other than anthrax, quite a few actually. All of which is why when dealing with a suspect anthrax situation involving humans and livestock one should get the veterinary team in as quickly as possible. And as livestock or wildlife will always be involved in anthrax, except in the cases of industrial exposure, you should call the vets first to sort it out and stop any further cases. They will make sure that any medical team is called if needed and without delay.When one reads accounts where medical teams are the only one called, time and again they chase down only human cases and take diagnostic samples for submission to their clinical laboratory. Fair enough, but checking on possible sources of infection takes some prior knowledge of the epidemiology and prior field experience as to where any possible contaminated materials -- meat, hides, bloody slaughter ground -- may be, even where the carcass is likely to have been dumped, and can be sampled. Plus making sure that any and all other livestock are promptly vaccinated or treated if they have a temperature. Any and all carcasses must be burnt or buried to limit the possibility of future outbreak. Treating humans is important but it does nothing to prevent future outbreaks of anthrax. - Mod.MHJ][Anthrax is a good example of why human, animal and environmental health professionals should be collaborating in investigations from the beginning. - Mod.MPP]
