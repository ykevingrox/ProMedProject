WHO Surveillance and monitoring, influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update - 283 (based on data up to 5 Feb 2017)-------------------------------------------------------Summary-------Influenza activity in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere continued to be elevated. Many countries especially in East Asia and Europe appeared to have already peaked and were reporting decreasing trends. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) virus was predominant. The majority of influenza viruses characterized so far were similar antigenically to the reference viruses contained in vaccines for use in the 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season. Nearly all tested viruses collected recently for antiviral sensitivity were susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications. - In North America, influenza activity with A(H3N2) virus predominating increased in the United States of America and Mexico, whereas in Canada influenza activity continued to decrease. - In Europe, influenza activity remained elevated with influenza A(H3N2) virus being the most prominent subtype. Most of the countries reported stable or decreasing trends compared with previous weeks. Persons aged over 65 years were most frequently associated with severe disease from influenza infection. - In East Asia, influenza activity appeared to be decreasing with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominant. - In Western Asia, influenza activity was decreasing with influenza A(H3N2) predominant in the region. Low levels of influenza B viruses were also detected. - In Southern Asia, influenza activity sharply increased in India and Sri Lanka, with mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 reported followed by influenza B and A(H3N2). - In South East Asia, influenza activity remained low. - In Northern Africa, influenza activity seemed to have peaked; influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus detections were reported. - In West Africa, influenza B continued to be detected in Ghana. - In the Caribbean countries and Central America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low in general, except in Puerto Rico where influenza activity remained above the seasonal threshold with influenza A(H3N2) predominating. - In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low, although RSV activity remained elevated in Colombia. - In the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.National Influenza Centers (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 83 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 23 January 2017 to 05 February 2017 (data as of 17 Feb 2017 11:53:23 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 154 949 specimens during that time period. 40 292 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 36 922 (91.6 percent) were typed as influenza A and 3370 (8.4 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 418 (2.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 and 14 024 (97.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 332 (62.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 197 (37.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Predominant A/H3N2 circulation among Influenza A and B-Yamagata lineage among Influenza B reported in this update, a continuation of the earlier trends in the 2016-17 season in the northern hemisphere. - Mod.UBA]******[2] Seasonal Vaccine Studies-EuropeDate: Thu 23 Feb 2017Source: Eurosurveillance [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22723>Systems for register-based monitoring of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) in real time were set up in Stockholm County, Sweden, and Finland, before start of the 2016/17 influenza season, using population-based cohort studies. Both in Stockholm and Finland, an early epidemic of influenza A(H3N2) peaked in week 52, 2016. Already during weeks 48 to 50, analyses of influenza VE in persons 65 years and above showed moderately good estimates of around 50 percent, then rapidly declined by week 2, 2017 to 28 and 32 percent in Stockholm and Finland, respectively. The sensitivity analyses, where time since vaccination was taken into account, could not demonstrate a clear decline, neither by calendar week nor by time since vaccination. Most (68 percent) of the samples collected from vaccinated patients belonged to the 3C.2a1 subclade with the additional amino acid substitution T135K in haemagglutinin (64 percent) or to subclade 3C.2a with the additional haemagglutinin substitutions T131K and R142K (36 percent). The proportion of samples containing these alterations increased during the studied period. These substitutions may be responsible for viral antigenic change and part of the observed VE drop. Another possible cause is poor vaccine immunogenicity in older persons. Improved influenza vaccines are needed, especially for the elderly.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Citation for this article: Hergens M, Baum U, Brytting M, Ikonen N, Haveri A, Wiman A, Nohynek H, Ortqvist A.

Euro Surveill. 2017;22(8):pii=30469. DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.8.30469>The study concludes that annual vaccination against circulating influenza viruses remains the best strategy for preventing influenza illness. However, VE varies widely and in some seasons the protection of especially older persons and other medical risk groups may be very low or even non-existing, particularly in seasons dominated by influenza A(H3N2) [< DOI: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.43.30381 PMID: 27813473>]. In addition, VE estimates in a given season may differ depending on whether the analysis is performed early/mid-season or at the end of the season, in most cases resulting in lower end-of-season estimates [< DOI: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.16.30201 PMID: 27124420>]. - Mod.UBA]******[3] Emergence of a new A/H3N2 subclade in London, United KingdomDate: Thu 23 Feb 2017Source: Eurosurveillance [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22720>We report the molecular investigations of a large influenza A(H3N2) outbreak, in a season characterized by sharp increase in influenza admissions since December 2016. Analysis of haemagglutinin (HA) sequences demonstrated co-circulation of multiple clades (3C.3a, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1). Most variants fell into a novel subclade (proposed as 3C.2a2); they possessed 4 unique amino acid substitutions in the HA protein and loss of a potential glycosylation site. These changes potentially modify the H3N2 strain antigenicity.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Citation for this article: Harvala H, Frampton D, Grant P, Raffle J, Ferns RB, Kozlakidis Z, Kellam P, Pillay D, Hayward A, Nastouli E, For the ICONIC Consortium. Emergence of a novel subclade of influenza A(H3N2) virus in London, December 2016 to January 2017. Euro Surveill. 2017;22(8):pii=30466. DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.8.30466>The authors concluded that 'the early start and higher intensity of the 2016/17 influenza A(H3N2) virus epidemic mirrored that of the season 2014/15 where the subtype H3N2 also predominated. During the 2014/15 season, most influenza A(H3N2) infections in Europe were shown to be caused by antigenically drifted virus variants within the new genetic subgroup 3C.2a . Our genetic analysis of London A(H3N2) viruses demonstrates ongoing co-circulation of drifted variants from multiple subclades (3C.3a, 3C.2a1 and proposed 3C.2a2). Four or more substitutions in 2 or more antibody binding sites are predicted to give an antigenically different virus [as observed in the study report]'.'The amino acid substitution S144K in the emerging subclade 3C.2a2 viruses together with the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site (N122D) shows potential for antigenic drift that warrants further monitoring during this ongoing season. Our findings in London of the rapid emergence of genetically drifted influenza A(H3N2) viruses underscore the potential for such strains to spread rapidly in hospital environments among patients and staff. Characterizing emerging strains of influenza by next generation sequencing adds to the local and national monitoring of influenza trends'. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/>.]
