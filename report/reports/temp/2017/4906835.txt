The individual involved is a 35 year old man resident in the Victoria community [AraucanÌ a region].According to information provided, the affected man began to have symptoms on 4 Mar 2017, however his 1st medical consultation was 9 Mar 2017 in the Victoria hospital, after he presented with fever, headache, and gastrointestinal upset. Then, during the morning of 10 Mar 2017, he was taken to the intensive care unit of the Guillermo Grant Benavente Hospital in ConcepciÌ n [BÌ o BÌ o region]. According to information issued by the health authority, he is in serious condition.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the man might have acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the AraucanÌ a region and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/23378>. - Mod.TY]
