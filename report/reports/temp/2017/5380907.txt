No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate. Southeast Michigan Hepatitis A Outbreak Cases and Deaths as of 12 Oct 2017**Table will be updated weekly by 4:00pm each FridayCases - 397Hospitalizations - 320 (85.6%)Deaths - 15 (4.0%)Please note: Table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the region, only those that are identified as outbreak-related. More descriptive data on the current outbreak can be found within the Comprehensive Summary.

More than a 1/3rd of the cases had neither homelessness nor substance abuse risk factors. As in California, MSM are not well represented, but concern must be present that it could spill over into this high risk group. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225>.]
