The KFDV was 1st isolated from sick monkeys captured in Kyasanur Forest, Shimoga district, Karnataka state; hence its name. The KFD virus (KFDV) is maintained by ticks, mammals, and bird cycles.

Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease.As per the media report above, a 45-year-old woman from Sattari taluka of North Goa district of Goa died of Kyasanur Forest Disease on [Mon 24 Apr 2017].
