He checked into a hospital in the city of Hakodate but died earlier this month [July 2017], according to the division.No tick bites were found, but a blood test confirmed his infection with a tick-borne virus. Officials said he could have been infected in the prefecture.The tick-borne virus that causes encephalitis is known to exist in parts of Hokkaido; 2 previous cases have occurred in the prefecture.The officials said infection with the virus only takes place where the virus-carrying ticks live, noting that the virus is not transmitted from person to person.A group of researchers at Hokkaido University in May [2017] said it has confirmed the virus infection among wild animals.A prefectural official warned people to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when they hike in the mountains or are near bushes and to seek medical help immediately if they are bitten.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Of the 3 types of tick-borne encephalitis virus, the Far Eastern type occurs in Hokkaido. It causes the most severe disease of the 3 types. The virus has been isolated from dogs and wild mammals, including the large Japanese field mouse _Apodemus speciosus_, and ticks (_Ixodes ovatus_) in Japan. Although the presence of Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis virus has been recognized in Japan for 20 years, this is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted.References:Takeda T, Ito T, Chiba M, Takahashi K, Niioka T, Takashima I.

Isolation of tick-borne encephalitis virus from wild rodents and a seroepizootiologic survey in Hokkaido, Japan. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1999 Feb; 60(2):287-91.Tickborne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. The WHO states: ""Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered safe and efficacious. <http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.].................................................sb/mpp/ty/msp/mpp"
