More than half of the west cases were males.Peters said close to half of the cases in west Auckland had been notified by schools - 40 in total. But the health body would not name the schools ""unless it's necessary to protect public health"".The Western Leader found mumps cases had been notified by Massey High School in March, Don Buck Primary School in June [2017], Lincoln Heights School in July [2017] and Prospect School in Glen Eden in September last year [2016].Peters said the biggest concern were cases recorded in secondary schools because ""immunity in that age group was well [below] the national average"".She said 58 of the people who became ill in west Auckland were not fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.Peters said 44 of those who had fallen ill were Pacific Islanders. Mumps cases among Samoans numbered 24, with 21 Maori people also contracting the viral illness.The suburb of Massey recorded the highest numbers out west with 31 mumps cases, Henderson had 17 and Ranui 11. The rest of the west cases were isolated in other suburbs.A total of 3 west Aucklanders had been hospitalised.The youngest west Auckland mumps sufferer was aged under one year, the oldest person diagnosed was aged 51.ARPHS said half of the west Auckland cases were in the 10 to 19 [years old] age group.""Low MMR vaccination rates amongst those aged 10--29 years in west Auckland are one of the main drivers for the high numbers of mumps cases in west Auckland,"" Peters said.""Many people with mumps were significantly unwell and some developed severe complications.""Males hospitalised from the outbreak in Auckland had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may led to infertility. One person had developed meningitis, and some women had experienced ovarian inflammation.Peters said the key was immunisation - 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine which was free of charge.Mumps cases rose significantly this year [2017] - 51 cases from January to April which was 2 --3 times above the norm from the past 3 years.Last year [2016], there were 35 mumps cases notified but only 13 confirmed.The last mumps outbreak in Auckland was in 2007 where there were 30 cases.Peters urged people to ask their doctor if their vaccinations were up to date, or seek medical help if they suspected mumps.Mumps is spread via saliva or mucus when coughing, sneezing, or talking. Infected droplets can transfer up to one metre [3 feet]. It's easily transmitted through toys, keyboards and door handles.Early symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. The salivary glands on one or both sides of the face, cheeks or jaw may become swollen and sore after 2 days.If people suspected mumps, they are asked to call their doctor, or Healthline for advice.

Adult males contracting the disease are at risk of sterility. Complications of mumps, such as hearing loss, are potentially serious, but rare. The disease is considered to be extremely contagious.Among the symptoms of mumps are:Swollen, painful salivary glands on one or both sides of your face (parotitis); fever; headache; muscle aches; weakness and fatigue; loss of appetite; pain while chewing or swallowing.Immediate medical care is suggested for those experiencing symptoms. Yet the Mayo Clinic reports there's no specific treatment for mumps. The website notes that mumps outbreaks still occur in the United States, and mumps is still common in many parts of the world, so getting a vaccination to prevent mumps remains important.See Healthyhorns website with questions related to mumps and suggestions if felled by the disease .[Byline: Tony Cantu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap of the United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>]
