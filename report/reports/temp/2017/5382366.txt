The distribution of these cases by district places Boghni by far at the 1st rank, and this is explained by the high prevalence of leishmaniasis in this part of the province. In fact, it could be explained by a high density of stray dogs that transmit rabies as well as leishmaniasis to humans.""In response to Dr Berger's above appreciated notes:1) the presented GIDEON chart [""Disease comparisons:"" rabies, 1990-2014, leishmaniasis,1995-2014]. The years 2015-2017, addressed in the reviewed study, are not (yet) included.2) cumulative numbers of disease cases in a given country do not necessarily reflect their distribution at provincial and local levels.3) in the moderator's comment, a direct link between rabies and leishmaniasis, as apparently suggested in the addressed study, was not supported. It stated that both leishmaniasis and rabies incidence are likely to reflect the high density of a stray dogs reservoir in the affected area. - Mods.AB/ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12576>.][See Also:Rabies (42): Africa, Asia, Europe, human, animal 20171013.5379441Rabies (26): Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan) Africa (Algeria) animal, human 20170616.51095292015----Rabies - Algeria: (TL) human, wolf susp, RFI 20150829.3610476Rabies - France (02): (LR) ex Algeria, canine, human exposure, OIE 20150525.3383986Rabies - France: (LR) ex Algeria, canine, human exposure 20150524.33828642010----Rabies - Algeria: (SF) animal, human exposure, alert].................................................arn/msp/dk"
