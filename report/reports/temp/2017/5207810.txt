ABC 6 [edited]<http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/mosquito-battle-continues-after-two-illnesses-in-central-ohio>A 2nd case of La Crosse encephalitis in Central Ohio is leading area health officials on the offensive against mosquitoes. A woman in Ashley [Delaware county] was hospitalized with symptoms of the mosquito-borne illness, but has been released, according to officials with the Delaware General Health District. District officials led a campaign of fogging and door-to-door notifications last week [week of 17 Jul 2017].""In rare cases, it can cause encephalitis, which is a swelling of the brain,"" said Adam Howard, environmental manager for the district. ""In less than one percent it would be fatal.""District officials last week dropped information, screen repair kits, and mosquito repellant at doors in the neighborhood. They also urge neighbors to eliminate standing water. Mosquitoes need as little water as it takes to fill a bottle cap to breed. The breeding takes 7 days for mosquitoes to go from eggs to larva.Neighbors in Ashley said they will take more precautions after the encephalitis case last week. [A resident] said she will cover her children's kiddie pool more regularly. ""I bought a tarp to keep it covered hoping that will keep the mosquitoes away,"" she said.The Delaware General Health District will also offer free larvicide for neighbors with concerns about standing water on their property.[Byline: Tom Bosco]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There was a previous case reported in Ohio this year (2017) in a 4-year-old child (see La Crosse encephalitis - USA: (OH) 20170715.5177421). As noted in that and previous cases, the Ohio case above occurred in one of the focal La Crosse virus (LACV) endemic areas. Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children, so a case in an adult is somewhat unusual. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur, and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal.The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus maintained through transovarial transmission.LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio, and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at <http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>). There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA.The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at <http://www.cdc.gov/LAC/index.html>.An image of _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_ can be seen at <http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=2166>.The state of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62013>.
