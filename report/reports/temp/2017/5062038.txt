Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/yemen-records-400-cholera-deaths-less-month-46413/>About 10 000 cholera cases and nearly 100 deaths have been reported in war-torn Yemen since our last report earlier this week [<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/yemen-cholera-cases-grow-3000/>]. According to a press release Thu 25 May 2017 the WHO reported that an aircraft carrying 67 tons of intravenous fluids and cholera kits has successfully landed at Sana'a airport, noting this is the largest planeload of medical goods WHO has brought into the country since the escalation of the conflict in March 2015.""Flying a jumbo jet into a war zone is not easy,"" said Dr Nevio Zagaria, WHO Representative in Yemen. ""You need the agreement of the parties to the conflict to ensure the plane is not accidentally caught up in the crossfire. We're thankful for their cooperation in allowing these life-saving supplies to reach the people of Yemen. We are also thankful for logistical support from the World Food Programme that allowed us to charter the plane.""The supplies, sufficient for the treatment of 10 000 patients, are a welcome boost to the country's response to a cholera outbreak which has caused more than almost 70 000 suspected cases since it began in October 2016. The epidemic had shown signs of slowing but recently reignited, causing 42 207 suspected cases and 420 deaths between 27 Apr 2017 and 24 May 2017. This has been reported in 74 percent (17/23) of the governorates. Most of the cases have been reported in the western governorates. The 4 most affected governorates were Amanat Al Asimah, Hajjah, Sana'a, and Amran, according to WHO.WHO continues to work with local health authorities and partners to scale up the response to the disease. 14 new diarrhea treatment centres have been set up across the country, in addition to the 26 treatment centres established during the 1st wave of the outbreak. WHO is also scaling up the network of oral rehydration points for the treatment of mild and moderate cases of dehydration. WHO is also helping to run the national and governorate emergency operations centres, supporting the disease surveillance system, and providing medicines and cholera treatment in the affected districts.Prior to Thursday's [25 May 2017] delivery, WHO had already distributed more than 28 cholera kits, sufficient for the treatment of 2800 people, and more than 115 000 bags of intravenous fluids for the rehydration of severely affected cases. A further 13 tons of supplies for the cholera response in the country's southern governorates will travel to Aden via ship.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 24 May 2017Source: The Guardian [edited]<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/24/scientists-race-against-time-yemen-deadly-cholera-outbreak-spirals>Malnutrition, lack of clean water, and a conflict that has destroyed infrastructure and hampered access to medical supplies have allowed the epidemic to escalate, according to those coordinating the aid response. ""This is the 2nd wave of cholera we have seen here recently, and it is spreading at an alarming rate,"" said Nevio Zagaria, head of mission in Yemen for the World Health Organization (WHO).Speaking from the capital, Sana'a, Zagaria said: ""We had an outbreak that started in October 2016 and which declined in January 2017. Now, in the last month, we have seen more cases in 3 weeks alone than in the previous 6 months."" Since 27 Apr 2017, there have been 329 deaths and 32 056 confirmed new cases, according to the latest figures. Of those, 16 percent are among children under 5 and 20 percent among children aged 5 to 14.""We have started an investigation to determine whether a new and more virulent strain of the cholera, perhaps originating in Somalia or Ethiopia, has been generating a higher mortality rate during this 2nd wave of infection,"" said Zagaria. Samples have already been collected by the WHO for testing in Paris. Experts hope the results can help them understand how the disease has been spreading.The immediate forecast is grim, however. Even by the most conservative estimates, there will be 150 000 cases of cholera within the next 6 months, said WHO statisticians. Yemen has a population of almost 27 million. With food shortages and hunger spreading, the UN estimates nearly 19 million people are in need of help. Among the most vulnerable are the undernourished. Medics on the ground said children are dying from a preventable disease because they lack supplies to treat them.In Sana'a -- the epicentre of the outbreak, with 8000 cases -- one doctor said his hospital had been receiving more than 100 suspected cases an hour. Dr Mohammed Zaid said: ""I personally received 180 cases in one day. People are left lying in the corridors and in some cases we are having to put 6 children in one bed.""We are urging the international organizations to scale up their response. We are facing so many challenges: we lack medicines and medical supplies, we do not have enough doctors and nurses. We don't even have a place to wash our hands.""Cholera, an acute diarrheal infection, is spread through contaminated food or water but can be effectively treated with the immediate replacement of lost fluids and salts. Without treatment it can lead to death in just a few hours, even for healthy adults. 3/4 of people infected with the disease display no symptoms, but the pathogens remain in their feces for 7 to 14 days, meaning they can infect others. Cholera can spread very quickly, especially in areas where there is overcrowding and poor sanitation.Experts in Yemen said a shortage of trained medical staff had led to misuse of the limited supply of intravenous fluids. Amid the political upheaval and violence, health workers already on extremely low salaries are no longer being paid. With the capital under rebel control since February 2015, the government has moved to the southern port city of Aden. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia has led a US-backed military intervention aimed at reinstating the ousted president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and countering the advances of the Iran-backed Houthi forces.""Medical professionals haven't been paid for months,"" said Mark Kaye, a humanitarian adviser for Save the Children. ""What we are seeing now in Yemen is a man-made disaster. As well as the latest outbreak of cholera potentially belonging to a more aggressive strain, there is a lack of systems in place to deal with the crisis. Facilities are being destroyed or damaged due to fighting. We can provide support on the frontline, but it's merely a sticking plaster. Only once there is a peace process can we get aid to the sick and hungry and start to rebuild the institutions that have been damaged or destroyed.""[Byline: Hannah Summers]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Wed 24 May 2017 13:07 IRDTSource: Tasnim News Agency [edited]<https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2017/05/24/1418217/cholera-bacteria-may-have-been-spread-in-yemen-intentionally>Director of a medical center in Yemen said cholera bacteria may have been spread in the war-torn country intentionally, as the World Health Organization has reported dramatic increases in cholera cases there.Earlier in May 2017, Yemen's Health Ministry declared a state of emergency in Sana'a in connection with the epidemic. International organizations, including the United Nations and the Red Cross, say the Saudi-led war on Yemen and an embargo against the country may be responsible for the cholera epidemic. The Saudi aggression has taken a heavy toll on the poor country's facilities and infrastructure, destroying many hospitals, schools, and factories.Since March 2015, the Saudi regime has been engaged in a brutal campaign against Yemen in an attempt to reinstall Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the president who resigned and is a staunch ally of Riyadh. The campaign also aims to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement. The Saudi regime has failed to achieve its objectives.Director of the Azal Medical Center, Dr Yahya Al-Hamdani, has suggested that the bacteria behind the outbreak may have been spread intentionally from the air, Press TV reported. ""The most important reasons for the aggression are that they have sprayed toxic gases from the air; and hidden forces have worked on the spread of the epidemic,"" he said.Another doctor at the center, Yousra Sourai, said that they are having difficulties dealing with the influx of patients diagnosed with cholera. ""We were receiving more than 500 cases at the medical complex. We did not know how we could receive these cases, with the shortage of medicine, nurses and doctors,"" she said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The dramatically increasing numbers are listed below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 420In 7 days, the number of reported cases has risen from 23 500 to 42 207 and the deaths from 209 to 420. Whether the strain involved has increased virulence is unclear at this point but the dreadful conditions in the country and lack of adequate care can account for some of the numbers.Formally, the 2 established biotypes of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, classical and El Tor, can be distinguished from one another by a number of phenotypic properties including hemolysis of sheep red blood cells, agglutination of chicken red blood cells, the Voges-Proskauer reaction, as well as susceptibility to polymyxin B and to biotype-specific viral bacteriophages. Hybrid biotypes, so-called Matlab variants, are also described (Nair GB, Faruque SM, Bhuiyan NA, et al: New variants of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 biotype El Tor with attributes of the classical biotype from hospitalized patients with acute diarrhea in Bangladesh. J Clin Microbiol 2002; 40(9): 3296-3299; abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12202569>). These strains are associated with a higher percentage of symptomatic cases.There is no evidence that the spread of cholera in Yemen is deliberate at this point. Regarding cholera as a biological weapon:""During World War II, the Japanese biological weapons program known as Unit 731 located in Pingfan Manchuria (24 kilometers south of Harbin) experimented with _Vibrio cholera_ as a weapons agent. It was reported that the Japanese dropped cholera and typhus cultures into more than 1000 Chinese wells and reportedly caused 10 000 cases in 1941. However, an estimated 1700 of the deaths were Japanese soldiers, a testimony to the difficulty of protecting one's own troops from biological agents and controlling infections. South Africa's biological weapons program, Project Coast (1981-1994), under the direction of Colonel Wouter Basson, developed cholera as a possible biological agent. It was reported that during South Africa's civil war, cholera, anthrax and other bacteria were released into water in rebel-held areas. Iraq's biological weapons program reportedly began with the start of the Al-Hazen Institute in 1974 where cholera was one of the biological agents under study. North Korea reportedly also studied cholera as a possible biological weapons agent."" <http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/bio_cholera.htm> - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
