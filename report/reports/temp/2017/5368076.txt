M Live [edited]<http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2017/10/first_2017_case_of_influenza_a.html>The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Allegan County Health Department confirmed in a press release the 1st case of [swine variant of influenza A/H3N2] in 2017. The agencies reported that a child who visited the Allegan County Fair last month [September 2017] tested positive for the H3N2 variant influenza.The child visited the fair sometime between [8-16 Sep 2017]. As the incubation period for this influenza is 1 to 7 days, it is unlikely there will be new cases from direct exposure to the Allegan County Fair, according the health agencies.There currently is no vaccine for H3N2v and the seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against it.Symptoms of H3N2v infection are similar to seasonal flu viruses and can include fever and respiratory symptoms. These included a cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Infections with influenza viruses can cause severe disease and complications, such as pneumonia which can lead to death.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the [influenza A/H3N2 virus] is thought to be spread from pigs to humans mainly when an infected pig coughs or sneezes and the droplets land in a person's nose or mouth or they are inhaled.The CDC reports that H3N2v affects humans similar to the seasonal flu.People who are at high risk of developing complications if they get influenza include children younger than 5 years of age, people 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions.[Byline: Bryce Airgood]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st case of influenza A/H3N2v reported from Michigan state in 2017; since 2012, 21 cases have been reported, with 12 cases reported during 2016.The A/H3N2v viruses were first identified in US pigs in 2010 (<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-situation.htm>). Between 2011 and September 2016, 364 human H3N2v cases were reported from 14 states. The largest outbreak occurred in 2012, when a total of 309 human cases of H3N2v flu were identified, including 16 hospitalizations and one death (<http://nasphv.org/Documents/Influenza_Transmission_at_Swine_Exhibitions_2016.pdf>). The majority of cases were exhibitors and others in close contact with pigs at agricultural fairs.Symptoms of H3N2v infection in people are usually mild and similar to those of seasonal flu viruses, but as with seasonal flu, complications can lead to hospitalization and death. Clinical features may include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, as well as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The incubation period (the time it takes from exposure to onset of illness) for this influenza is also typically similar to seasonal influenza at about 2 days, but may be up to 10 days.There are ways to reduce the spread of influenza viruses between pigs and people (<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/swineflu/prevent-spread-flu-pigs-at-fairs.pdf>).CDC recommendations for people not at high risk include:- don't take food or drink into pig areas; don't eat, drink, or put anything in your mouth in pig areas;- don't take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items into pig areas. Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill;- take protective measures if you must come in contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes minimizing contact with pigs and wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves and masks that cover your mouth and nose when contact is required;- wash your hands often with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub;- to further reduce the risk of infection, minimize contact with pigs in the pig barn or arenas;- avoid contact with pigs if you have flu symptoms. Wait to have contact with pigs until 7 days after your illness started or until you have been without fever for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications, whichever is longer;- people with high risk factors who develop flu symptoms should call a health care provider;The same influenza antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can be used to treat variant virus infection. - Mod.UBAThe state of Michigan can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4551>.
