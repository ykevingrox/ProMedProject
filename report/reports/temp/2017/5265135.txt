Levante [in Spanish, trans.KS, edited]<http://www.levante-emv.com/comunitat-valenciana/2017/08/18/salud-publica-eleva-siete-casos/1606017.html>The Directorate General of Public Health of the Ministry of Universal Healthcare and Public Health reports that it has been notified of a new case of legionnaires' [disease], the 7th related to the outbreak in the downtown area of Calicanto de Chiva, which has claimed the life of one victim, as revealed by Levante-EMV and confirmed later by the ministry. As has been reported by the regional administration, this case is a 59 year old woman who displayed symptoms in July [2017] and was admitted to the General Hospital of Valencia where, after performing various tests (including for legionellosis, which was initially negative), she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She received antibiotic treatment and has now received a clean bill of health.Yesterday [Thu 17 Aug 2017] the patient was seen for follow-up and, since she worked in the risk zone, the legionellosis tests were repeated and a positive result was confirmed today [Fri 18 Aug 2017]. The explanation given by the public health service is that legionellosis can appear in urine up to 3 months after the infection clears, confirming that the pneumonia that was treated in July [2017] was caused by legionella [bacteria]. However, she has already been discharged and her condition is good.The Department of Public Health would like to emphasize that there is not a new outbreak, since the woman displayed symptoms at the end of July [2017] and has already been cured.[byline: David LaguÌ a]--communicated byKathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>******[2]Date: Wed 16 Aug 2017 07:30 EDTSource: El Pais [in Spanish, trans.KS, edited]<https://elpais.com/ccaa/2017/08/16/valencia/1502878254_552429.html>An outbreak of legionellosis, with 6 cases identified but none of them seriously ill, in the housing development of Calicanto de Chiva (Valencia) has required the supply of drinking water to be cut off until 8:00 am today [Thu 17 Aug 2017] to allow the cleaning of the reservoir, the origin of the outbreak, sources within the Ministry of Health have confirmed.The Department of Health detected an outbreak in the housing development of Calicanto de Chiva (Valencia) affecting 6 people, 2 of whom remain hospitalized in the Hospital of Manises, although their condition is not serious.The origin of the outbreak, according to the 1st studies, could be in the development's water supply, which is being cleaned and chlorinated 1st thing today [Wed 16 Aug 2017], says the Department of Health. Last [Mon 14 Aug 2017] a meeting took place between members of the Chiva City Council, public health technicians, and representatives of the water management company, and it was decided to clean the reservoir and the affected facilities.First thing this morning [Wed 16 Aug 2017], the water management company began emptying the tank, which is being chlorinated, and after a few hours they will refill the tank and distribute the treated water to the pipes over 12 hours so that it will disinfect the distribution system. The sources calculate that at 8.00 am this [Thu 17 Aug 2017] the disinfection process will be done and the residents of the Calicanto development will have water again.Public health recommended to the City of Chiva and the water management firm, as well as residents, that internal networks be sanitized, for example, in the case of electric and gas heaters, that water tanks be left plugged in and the water be kept at a temperature of at least 60 degrees Celsius [140 å¡F].After any absence of more than 10 days, or at least once a year, the water system has to be cleaned and disinfected. To do this, disinfect the faucet [tap] diffusers and showers, descale them with conventional anti-scale cleaner and immerse them in a bucket with dilute bleach for 30 minutes (simply add a coffee cup filled with commercial bleach to a 5 litre [1.32 gallon] bucket of water). It is also advisable to run cold water and hot water through all faucets in the house simultaneously for 5 minutes, and, in the case of faucet diffusers and showers, replace those that are deteriorated.[byline: Jordi Vicent]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Calicanto de Chiva is a development in the city of Chiva; Chiva had a population of 15 652 residents in 2014 and is 20 minutes west [by car] of the coastal city of Valencia (<https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiva>). A map of Chiva can be found at <https://www.google.com/maps/place/46370+Chiva,+Valencia,+Spain>.Detection of soluble legionella antigen in urine specimens is a rapid method that can provide an early diagnosis of infection due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, the commonest cause of legionnaires' disease in most localities. The assay will not detect organisms other than _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Excretion of legionella antigen in urine may vary among patients. Legionella antigenuria can be detected as early as one day after onset of symptoms and persists for days to weeks. Some individuals have been shown to excrete antigen for extended periods of time (up to one year after acute infection (1).No information is given in the news reports above concerning genotyping both the clinical and environmental legionella isolates, which would help confirm transmission pathways.1.
