Reuters [edited]<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-cholera-idUSKBN18J2QL>The number of cholera cases in Yemen has leapt, a WHO document showed on [Tue 23 May 2017], with 35 217 suspected cases since 27 April 2017 when the outbreak began to spread rapidly. That represents a 50 percent increase in the reported incidence compared with figures given last [Fri 19 May 2017], by the WHO representative in the country, Nevio Zagaria, who said at that point there had been 23 425 cases since 27 April 2017.A WHO epidemiology bulletin covering the period up to 22 May 2017 said 361 deaths had been reported, mainly in western governorates of Yemen. That is a rise of more than 100 since [Fri 19 May 2017], when Zagaria said 242 people had died.The epidemic began in October 2016 and grew until December. It then dwindled but was never brought fully under control, and a new surge in cases began in April 2017 worsened by the collapse of the economy and the health system. The total number of cases reported since December 2016 stands at 61 000, the bulletin said. Zagaria said last week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] that the total could reach 300 000 in the next 6 months.Caused by ingesting the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium from water or food contaminated with faeces, cholera usually manifests itself with a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhea and can kill within hours, although 3-quarters of infected people show no symptoms. The short incubation period means outbreaks can spread with explosive speed, especially in places without safe water and proper sanitation, according to the WHO.Yemen has been ruined by 2 years of civil war, with 18.8 million people needing humanitarian aid, many of them on the brink of famine. Less than 45 percent of the country's health facilities are fully functional.[Byline: Tom Miles]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The dramatically increasing numbers are as follows:Date [2017] / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 361. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
