The specific situation under which the young man acquired his hantavirus infection is not stated. As a dairy farm worker, he no doubt came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus. The numbers of cases of hantavirus infections in the Los Lagos region continue to increase this year (2017).Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37584>. - Mod.TY]
