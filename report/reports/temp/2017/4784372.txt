9 News, Australian Associated Press (AAP) report [edited]<http://www.9news.com.au/health/2017/01/17/16/56/health-alert-over-two-vic-measles-cases>Health authorities are warning people to be on the alert for measles after 2 teenagers were diagnosed with the infection in Melbourne.The teenagers, siblings from the same family, might have been unwell when they returned home from Malaysia on Air Asia flight D7214 arriving at 9:30 AM on [5 Jan 2017].The teens also visited the Fountain Gate Shopping Centre in Melbourne and went to the cinema before they were diagnosed, the Department of Health and Human Services says.Victoria's Chief Health Officer Charles Guest is concerned others could have been infected. ""Measles has an incubation period of up to 18 days so illness acquired from contact could still be coming through, and cases could still remain infectious for many days,"" Professor Guest said in a statement on [Tue 17 Jan 2017].The disease is highly infectious, usually beginning with common cold symptoms such as fever, sore throat, red eyes and a cough.A rash usually begins 3-7 days after the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body.People can develop pneumonia and other serious complications from the disease.One of the 2 teenagers was hospitalised, but both are now recovering at home, the Department said.While the disease is uncommon in Australia thanks to the use of the measles vaccine, most cases are linked to international travel.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Australia (New South Wales): importedDate: Tue 17 Jan 2017 4:00 PM AEDTSource: Port Macquarie News [edited]<http://www.portnews.com.au/story/4409720/reported-measles-case-on-mid-north-coast/>The North Coast Public Health Unit has been notified of a case of measles in the Macleay Valley [New South Wales] and anticipates that other cases may emerge over coming days. The person acquired the infection overseas, and developed measles symptoms after returning home.Public Health Director Paul Corben said that measles is highly infectious among people who are not fully immunised.Anyone in the Port Macquarie or Kempsey areas who is not protected against measles should be alert for symptoms, particularly those who were at the Majestic Cinema in Port Macquarie on Sun 8 Jan 2017, Barnett's Bakery in Kempsey on Mon 9 Jan 2017, Kempsey District Hospital Emergency Department on [Thu 12 or Fri 13 Jan 2017], or Tristar Medical Centre in Kempsey on Fri 13 Jan 2017.""Measles is spread through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms can include fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough, and sore red eyes, which usually last for several days before a red blotchy rash appears. Complications range from an ear infection and diarrhoea, through to pneumonia and swelling of the brain (encephalitis),"" Mr Corben said.""Vaccination with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the only way to prevent infection. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for children, with the 1st at 12 months and the 2nd at 18 months of age,"" Mr Corben said.People born during or after 1966 who do not have 2 documented doses of MMR vaccine should contact their local health provider for vaccination advice. People born before 1966 are usually immune because they had measles during childhood. The MMR vaccine is free to people born during or after 1966.""The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is typically 10 days, but can be as short as a week or as long as 18 days. People are infectious for 24 hours before symptoms appear and remain infectious until 4 days after appearance of the rash. Anyone who contracts measles should stay away from work, preschool, school, and other public places until at least 4 days after the onset of the rash when they are no longer infectious"" Mr Corben said.Anyone with symptoms of measles should contact their General Practitioner [GP] in advance before arriving for assessment to ensure they can be isolated from other patients,"" Mr Corben said.Vaccination is the only way of preventing the occurrence of measles in our community. For vaccination to be effective, a high level of MMR vaccine coverage must be maintained.Reports on the progress towards eradication of measles in Australia show that the overwhelming majority of measles cases that occurred in Australia in recent years were acquired either when unvaccinated Australians travelled overseas or were directly linked to returning infected travellers. At the moment there are numerous places in Australia (Brisbane, Sydney) and around the globe that are experiencing measles outbreaks including many locations in USA, Indonesia, Singapore, Pakistan, the Middle East, Switzerland, other parts of Europe, China, and Africa.""Because of the ongoing risk of measles to travellers when overseas and to their families and local communities when they return home, it is very important that everyone checks their measles vaccination status before travelling.""If you were born during or after 1966 and haven't received 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine, before leaving Australia you should talk with your GP about getting vaccinated,"" Mr Corben advised.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Even with Australia being declared measles-free by the World Health Organization on 20 Mar 2014, it is important for children to be vaccinated to maintain a high level of immunity in the population, making it difficult for the disease to spread from person to person following introduction of virus. In addition, the MMR vaccine will protect individuals who travel outside the country to locations where measles activity still occurs.Maps of Australia can be accessed at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186>. - Mod.LK]******[3] USA (California, San Luis Obispo County)Date: Wed 18 Jan 2017 9:35 PM CETSource: KSBY [edited]<http://www.ksby.com/story/34290493/second-case-of-measles-reported-in-san-luis-obispo-county>The San Luis Obispo County [California] Public Health Department on [We 18 Jan 2017] reported a 2nd case of measles in the county.Health officials say the patient, a child under 1 year of age, had contact with an adult who was diagnosed with measles in early January [2017].They say the child was too young to be vaccinated. It is recommended that children get vaccinated against the virus at 12-15 months of age.The adult patient was also unvaccinated and began showing symptoms starting [3 Jan 2107] after having contact with international travelers over the holidays.The Public Health Department has reportedly quarantined several people who had contact with that person in an attempt to limit the spread of the disease.Measles is highly contagious and spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, and pink eye, which can be followed by small white spots inside the mouth 2 or 3 days later. Then, a rash of small red spots appears, starting on the face and spreading to the rest of the body.In the wake of this most recent case, Public Health officials are stressing the importance of vaccinations. They say if you are unsure of your vaccination status to check with your doctor.[Byline: Katherine Worsham]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] USA (California, Los Angeles County)Date: Fri 20 Jan 2017 6:00 AM PSTSource: LA Times [edited]<http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-measles-20170120-story.html>California's strict new vaccination law failed to prevent a new outbreak of measles in western Los Angeles [LA] County. 6 months after California's strict vaccine law took effect, a measles outbreak has infected 20 people, prompting a search for others who may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus.Most of the patients live in western areas of the county, including LA's Westside, the Santa Monica Mountains, and the San Fernando Valley. Santa Barbara and Ventura counties each reported 1 case.At least 15 of the 18 LA County patients either knew one another or had a clear social connection, said Dr Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, interim health officer for the LA County Department of Public Health. None of the 18 could provide proof of vaccination, he said.Gunzenhauser said the 1st person was diagnosed in early December [2016], followed by 16 cases in the last 3 weeks of 2016, and then one more case last week [week of 9 Jan 2017].""I'm hopeful that we're getting to the end of this,"" he said.Hershy Z Ten, a rabbi who runs Jewish healthcare foundation Bikur Cholim in LA's Beverly Grove neighborhood, said county health officials told him a measles outbreak was affecting the county's Orthodox Jewish community. He convened a panel last week to discuss steps that Jewish day schools and synagogues could take to stem the outbreak and ensure unvaccinated children are immunized.""Measles is very, very serious,"" he said. ""Those children are at risk and they put other children at risk.""A measles outbreak that began at Disneyland in 2014 infected 145 people across the United States, as well as dozens in Canada and Mexico. It led to the passage of a law in California requiring all children to be vaccinated unless a doctor provides a medical exemption. The law took effect in July [2016].California is now one of 3 states that forbid children from opting out of vaccines because of religious or personal beliefs.Health experts say the outbreak reveals the degree to which immunity against the disease has eroded -- a problem the new law will probably improve but not completely fix.""It really speaks to what we're so concerned about, which is parents making their decisions not to vaccinate their kids, and they can bring their kids into any setting and then contaminate everyone,"" said Dr Robert Adler, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. If an infected person walks into a room, the virus can stay there for 2 hours after the person leaves, ready to infect someone. And it's dangerous -- 15 people die every hour worldwide from measles, according to the World Health Organization.To try to stop the spread of the virus in Southern California, LA County health workers spent the last several weeks chasing down people who might have been exposed. Infected people develop a rash that can take weeks to show up, but they can transmit the virus to others before that.Gunzenhauser said county health workers interviewed each infected person to find out everywhere they went during the four days before and after they developed a rash.Then they tried to figure out who might have been at those locations. If someone went to an emergency room, for instance, they asked the hospital for a list of patients there that day.The county ultimately identified more than 2000 people who may have come into contact with a measles patient, and discovered that about 10 percent of them hadn't been vaccinated against the disease. Half of those who weren't protected were given a vaccination or other treatment to prevent them from getting measles, he said.Gunzenhauser said the outbreak was contained to a group of people who shared a social circle, which made it easier to track down who might have come into contact with the virus.""It is a little bit unusual, but it's fortunate,"" he said. ""If this is a Disneyland thing or if this happened at Staples Center ... that would be problematic for us.""However, that doesn't mean people in other parts of the county are safe from the highly contagious virus, he said. ""Measles just isn't that way,"" he said. ""They could've driven and let's say they stopped at a gas station -- somebody could've gotten exposed.""Though the state's new law, known as SB 277, makes vaccinations mandatory, schools are only required to check children's immunization statuses when they hit kindergarten or 7th grade. That means that a child who went unvaccinated upon entering kindergarten in fall 2015 because his parents opted out could have continued in 1st grade this past fall [2016] -- still without vaccines.""It was sort of a phase-in, so by the time over the next 7 years, 6 years, we will eventually get to a point where every child is required [to be vaccinated], but it's going to take some time for us to get there,"" said Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), a physician who wrote the legislation. ""It won't happen right away.""Children are supposed to receive 2 vaccines to protect against measles before they start kindergarten.A bigger concern, Pan said, are the thousands of Californians who've already finished their schooling and never received immunizations. The UC [University of California] system has said it will require vaccines for all new enrollees, but most young adults won't encounter another vaccination checkpoint once they leave high school.""You have critical masses of people who never got caught up on their immunizations,"" Pan said. ""We've been accumulating an ever-growing number ... and that becomes the basis and source of outbreaks.""That fear appears to be borne out in the most recent cluster of measles cases. Of the 18 cases in L.A. County, the biggest share were people in their 20s, though ages ranged from young children to older adults, Gunzenhauser said.Adler, with Children's Hospital, said some parents don't vaccinate their kids because they believe they'll be protected by herd immunity -- the idea that if a certain percentage of people are vaccinated everyone will be safe from illness. But measles is so contagious that between 96 percent and 99 percent of people need to be immunized to establish herd immunity.The state Health Department reported that in the 2015-16 school year, 94.5 percent of kindergartners had been vaccinated against measles.""There are kids who've only had the one vaccine or none,"" Adler said. ""It's pretty disturbing.""[Byline: Soumya Karlamangla]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.

Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(3): pii=30443]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Since the early 1990s, the Netherlands has experienced several large measles epidemics, in 1992-94, 1999-2000, and in 2013-14. These outbreaks mainly affected orthodox Protestants, a geographically clustered population with overall lower measles-mumps-rubella 1st dose (MMR-1) vaccination coverage (60 percent) than the rest of the country (greater than 95 percent). In the 2013-14 epidemic described here, which occurred between 27 May 2013 and 12 Mar 2014, 2700 cases were reported. Several control measures were implemented including MMR vaccination for 6-14-month-olds and recommendations to reduce the risk in healthcare workers. The vast majority of reported cases were unvaccinated (94 percent, nÛä=Ûä2539), mostly for religious reasons (84 percent, nÛä=Ûä2135). The median age in the epidemic was 10 years, 4 years older than in the previous epidemic in 1999-2000. A likely explanation is that the inter-epidemic interval before the 2013-2014 epidemic was longer than the interval before the 1999-2000 epidemic. The size of the unvaccinated orthodox Protestant community is insufficient to allow endemic transmission of measles in the Netherlands. However, large epidemics are expected in the future, which is likely to interfere with measles elimination in the Netherlands and elsewhere.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is a new publication on an old measles outbreak in the Netherlands Bible belt. See ProMED Measles update (30) 20130728.1850496. As stated earlier, the problem is unvaccinated individuals becoming infected and spreading the virus to other non-immune people. Unvaccinated individuals present a risk not only to themselves, but also present a public health risk.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the Netherlands can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/104>. - Mod.LK]
