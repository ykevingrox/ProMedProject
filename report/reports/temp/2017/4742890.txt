As a precautionary measure, indoor residential sprays have been carried out in more than 15 000 rooms in the residential areas of Malir that were affected by the virus, said Panhwar.However, he said that all other 4 districts of Karachi are free of chikungunya fever, while referring to the reports received by him through the district health officers.
