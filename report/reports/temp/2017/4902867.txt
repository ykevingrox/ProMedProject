Saigon Giai Phong Daily [edited]<http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2017/3/123523/>The number of kids with pertussis skyrockets in [the] North. The Department of Preventive Medicine under the Ministry of Health said yesterday [Sun 12 Mar 2017] that since the beginning of the year [2017], 82 kids with pertussis had been reported; mostly from the northern provinces of Cao Bang, Hanoi, Hai Duong, Phu Tho, Ha Nam and the central province of Nghe An. Amongst localities, Hanoi has 21 cases with 1 death.In the meantime, the National Children Hospital showed an upward trend of the disease in children. During the past 3 months, the hospital recorded 55 infection cases while it was 12 cases in the same period last year [2016] and it was 10 cases in 2015.The Department also said that the cold weather in the North is conducive to the disease outbreaks. To make matters worse, many of them [the kids] had not been vaccinated.[Byline: Nguyen Quoc, translated by Uyen Phuonng]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces and 5 municipalities existing at the same level as provinces.

A ""mini epidemic"" of whooping cough has afflicted Canterbury for the past 20 months. Health officials are calling for mothers and family members to immunise themselves as well as their children.Between November 2016 and March 2017, 50 confirmed cases and 39 probable cases of whooping cough were reported to the Canterbury District Health Board. Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Ramon Pink said the demographic of people afflicted was similar to a major epidemic, with the bulk of cases in people under the age of 15.The last major whooping cough epidemic was in 2012, during which there were more than 100 cases reported in Canterbury in [a few] months. Pink said the situation was an increase above the ""endemic"" å  or normal å  infection levels. ""Maybe what we we're seeing is an increase in the endemic level rather than a mini epidemic."" He said infant vaccination levels were very good in Canterbury, at 95 per cent for the last 15 months reported. ""Vaccination, with vaccine-preventable diseases, is still the most effective tool we have.""Pink said the mini epidemic was not a major concern, but it was a reminder to healthcare providers to be vigilant. ""The fact that we have occasional clusters in different communities is not uncommon. And so we would address those as we usually would. We would just be more concerted in our effort to encourage timely vaccination. Which is what we have been doing.""He said an area to work on was encouraging expecting mothers to get vaccinated between 28 weeks and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Pink said immunity to whooping cough wanes over time, so adults and teenagers might need another vaccination, particularly if they are going to be around children.""An adult who has whooping cough is pretty crook, but the real risk for the littlies, particularly down to 1 [year old], since their airways are really tiny."" People with a cold should avoid visiting young babies, he said. ""If you want to be sure, go to your GP and get vaccinated against whooping cough so that when you visit you're minimizing the risk to that newborn."" More information on whooping cough, and who should be immunised and when, is available on the Ministry of Health website.[Byline: Jamie Small]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Canterbury, with a population of 600 100 residents, is a region of New Zealand, located in the central-eastern South Island; Christchurch is the South Island's largest city with 65 percent of the region's population (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury,_New_Zealand>). - Mod.ML]******[3] New Zealand (Bay of Plenty)Date: Wed 8 Mar 2017, 5:00 PMSource: Bay of Plenty Times [edited]<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&objectid=11814447>In the first 7 weeks of 2017 there have been 7 cases of whooping cough in the Bay of Plenty, 2 of which were babies. ""We're not off to a good start,"" Toi Te Ora Public Health Service medical officer of health Dr Phil Shoemack, said.The number of people with whooping cough increased across the Bay last year [2016] - up 61 from 2015. A total of 10 of these were babies, who were at most risk of complications, and 11 were young children aged from 1 to 4 years old. Already this year [2017] small children have been admitted to hospital with the disease. Babies under 1-year-old are at the most risk of serious complications from the illness such as pneumonia and brain damage.Pregnant women could get a whooping cough booster vaccination free between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. This was the time she could pass her immunity on to the baby, helping protect them until they were old enough to be vaccinated against whooping cough themselves as part of their free childhood immunisation at 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months old.Mr. Shoemack said as children have now gone back to school and preschool, it was a good time to check if family was up to date with immunisations. Immunisation coordinator Diane Newland said women should talk to their GP about the Boostrix vaccine and when the right time to have it. ""Staff should also be able to talk about immunisations for your baby and the importance of getting these on time.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Bay of Plenty is a region on the northern coast of New Zealand's North Island <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Plenty>.

Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old.DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Lower-case ""d"" and ""p"" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations of the vaccine. In the ""acellular"" vaccine, the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.In the U.S., children should get 5 doses of DTaP, 1 dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/recommendations.html>). One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3167>.]
