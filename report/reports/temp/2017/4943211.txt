""Immediately after the impact, patients and staff reported suffering severe respiratory symptoms and burning of mucous membranes -- symptoms consistent with an attack using chemicals.""The health authority of opposition-held parts of Hama blamed the attack on Syrian government warplanes. The Syrian government denies attacking hospitals and says it only targets militants.The medical charity said the strike knocked the hospital out of service for 3 days, after which the emergency room reopened. The attack killed an orthopedic surgeon, leaving nearly 120 000 people with only 2 such doctors, it added.Jets have pounded rebel-held areas in rural Hama this week [week of 27 Mar 2017], as government forces fought to reverse the biggest assault by insurgent groups in months.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitoring group, said the escalation in strikes injured at least 50 people in recent days.Air strikes that hit the same town of Latamneh on [Thu 30 Mar 2017] also led several people to choke, the Observatory and a doctor had said, describing it as sign of a gas attack.Abdallah Darwish, head of the health authority for rebel-held areas of Hama province, said earlier the strikes on [Thu 30 Mar 2017] caused ""irritation, heavy foaming from the mouth, and constricting pupils"" citing his medical staff on the ground.A Syrian military source denied the accounts on [Thu 30 Mar 2017]. ""The army has not, will not, and does not need to use these weapons,"" the source said.A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the 6-year-old war.[Byline: Ellen Francis; editing: Andrew Roche]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Syria can be seen at <http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/syria/syria-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/25887>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJThe Syrian government forces have allegedly used chemical weapons such as chlorine and mustard gas on several occasions in their attacks on the opposition and rebel forces.The report above reveals 2 new suspected attacks by the Syrian government forces in Latamneh town in Hama province.
