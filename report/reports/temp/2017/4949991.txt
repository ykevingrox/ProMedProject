The Department of Health and Human Services and Whitehorse Council [Victoria] are still investigating the cause of the outbreak which affected at least 21 people who ate at the Food Republic on Blackburn Rd on [Sat 18 Mar 2017]. The outbreak has since been contained, and both the council and Department of Health have said there was no ongoing risk to anyone who eats at the restaurant.Food Republic co-owner Vanessa Lekkas said she was ""genuinely distraught"" for those who had been affected and was ""humbled by their understanding"". ""In almost 30 years of working in the industry we've never seen this happen,"" Ms Lekkas said. ""We get hundreds of boxes delivered each week, and it looks like one of those contained a bad batch of eggs. We've been fully transparent with the council and health authorities, and they've seen our food handling processes are up to scratch.""""We've been told the investigation is now looking at the farms where the eggs came from,"" Ms Lekkas said. Ms Lekkas added that the Food Republic would no longer be serving food made with raw egg products.Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Bram Alexander said some people had been hospitalized with the infection. ""The department was alerted to a number of cases of salmonellosis in people treated at Box Hill Hospital as well as complaints made to the council,"" Mr. Alexander said.[Byline: Paddy Naughtin]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The serotype of _S. enterica_ has not been identified in this significant outbreak of salmonellosis in Australia's Victoria state in the southern part of the country. Victoria is the island nation's most populous state.Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient if pasteurized. - Mod.LLMaps of Australia can be seen at <http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif> and a Healthmap of Victoria can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/288>. - Copy.Ed.AO]
