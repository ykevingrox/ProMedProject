Walla.co.il [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, summ., edited]<http://news.walla.co.il/item/3061927>The Ministry of Health announced today [Thu 4 May 2017] that 30 children at a day care center in Jerusalem were infected last week [week of 24 Apr 2017] with salmonella, and 2 of them were admitted to a hospital. An examination conducted yesterday [Wed 3 May 2017] by the city's district health office found that the children began to get infected last [Thu 27 Apr 2017], apparently following contact with chicks brought to the Emunah club.The examination began following a statement by one of the mothers about intestinal disease among children in one of the class groups. The investigation revealed that 15 out of 24 children aged 2 years got sick with one of them being hospitalized, while in the one year old group, 15 out of 18 infants got sick, one of whom was hospitalized.Yesterday [Wed 3 May 2017], the Health Bureau received a positive culture result for salmonella from one of the sick children and a health inspector on behalf of the bureau issued a sanitation check. Some flaws were noticed in the kitchen, but not salmonella [see comment]. It was only following information given by one of the mothers about contact with the chicks that the source of the infection was discovered.The Ministry of Health said that ""direct contact with infected animals is one of the recognized sources of salmonella outbreaks."" It was also indicated that in order to prevent continued infections, ""it is important not to send sick children to the kindergarten, since the bacteria can pass from one child to another.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Confirmation of the suspected etiology, including the significance of the chicks as source of infection, and serotyping results of the pathogen are anticipated. It will be interesting to note how salmonella contamination in the kitchen was denied.Coincidentally with the publication above but without likely epidemiological connection, the following report has been published by another national media source. - Mod.AS]******[2] Northern Israel: _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis, table eggs, control measuresDate: Thu 4 May 2017Source: The Marker/Haaretz [in Hebrew, machine trans. & summ., edited]<http://www.themarker.com/misc/article-print-page/1.4066831>The Veterinary Services of the Ministry of Agriculture have recently detected _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis in laying poultry farms in the Moshav [village] Alma, in the upper Galilee. The Ministry published the findings publicly after being contacted by The Marker on the issue.The Ministry of Agriculture's announcement did not include details about the identification of the eggs marketed from the affected farms. Consumers are not in [a] state to know if purchased eggs originated in the infected farms or if they belong to a contaminated batch. No recall procedure has been applied; a recall should include, inter alia, information allowing the public to refrain from purchasing or using the contaminated food.Table eggs from Moshav Alma are generally sold to large, well-known marketers in the country.Salmonella is one of the commonest infective agents causing digestive tract infections in humans and animals. A common result is diarrhea, but severe cases are known to occur, particularly affecting children, the elderly and people with deficient immune system.Despite the hazard, in Israel it is not customary to recall contaminated table eggs because the official recommendation is to eat boiled eggs only. This is, in difference with industrialized countries where recalls of contaminated eggs are known to have been applied, in view of the fact that raw uncooked eggs are consumed or incorporated into certain uncooked dishes/products (for example, mayonnaise). Such eggs [may] also contaminate other food handled on the same work surfaces in kitchens. This is of particular hazard in public enterprises (such as hotels, restaurants, hospitals, catering companies).The Ministry of Agriculture said that at this stage, they anticipate final results from the laboratory investigations. They added: ""Routine monitoring was conducted by the inspectors of the Ministry's Veterinary Services following a suspicion of salmonella infections in a henhouse in Moshav Alma was raised. In accordance with the prevailing procedures, the plant has been closed and marketing of the eggs prohibited. The _S._ Enteritidis was identified in a laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture; its confirmation and further typing is expected soon from the reference laboratory in the Ministry of Health.""Recently the Ministry of Agriculture initiated a new program for monitoring salmonella in laying farms (eggs) and in poultry slaughterhouses, aiming in reducing the contamination load in marketed eggs and in poultry meat. The program will include 3 visits per year in each egg-producing farm; in case _S._ Enteritidis or _S._ Typhimurium is detected, marketing of table eggs from the affected farm will be banned. The eggs will be destroyed or undergo pre-marketing pasteurization.""Regarding the fact that the ministry will not carry out a recall, they clarified that ""at the moment, it is only a matter of suspicion; the directives of the Ministry of Health to the public, advising to consume eggs only after cooking, frying or baking, should be adhered to. In addition it deserves to be noted that even if a flock of poultry is found positive for salmonella, the bacterium will transmit to less than one per cent of the eggs; according to applied risk assessment, and in line with policies in other countries, it was decided that there is no basis for ordering a recall [see comment]. The applied monitoring is aimed to reduce the contamination by salmonella; there is no way to prevent it altogether.The Ministry of Health said: ""The Ministry welcomes the start of the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary Services program aiming at reducing salmonella contamination in poultry farms In the State of Israel, similar to programs implemented in industrialized countries. The Ministry of Health has noted from the Ministry of Agriculture that _S._ Enteritidis has been detected in environmental samples in several poultry farms and about the undertaken subsequent actions, including the destruction of such flocks.""Although these are only environmental tests, the Ministry of Health is again reminding the public to consume eggs only after cooking, frying or baking; this, while assuming that eggs, and raw food in general, may contain pathogenic bacteria.""[byline: Adi Dovrat-Moritz]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A recall of table eggs in Israel is not feasible for the simple reason that table eggs cannot be traced back to the producer's site since they are not identifiable to the producer's level. Eggs are stamped, as prescribed by the existing legislation, only at the level of the ""egg collection centers"" (""egg sorting centers"" or ""packing centers""). The stamp includes dates and the license number of the center but there is no identification of the producer. The dates should be related to the day the egg was produced; however, it was found in the past, that the collection of the eggs from the premises of the producer to the centers were not always applied daily, as prescribed by law, but only once in 2 (or even more) days. The current number of egg collection centers is 27 (see their list -- in Hebrew -- at <https://foodinspection.org/establishmentTypereport.aspx>).Adult chickens carry salmonella, including _S._ Enteritidis and other serotypes which may be of significant pathogenicity for humans, without -- in the majority of cases -- any disease in the animals. The animal health may remain unaffected: no morbidity/mortality, no direct losses to the owners. Disease in young chicks, however, may occur (there are no chicks on laying farms). It is indeed this situation which leads to difficulties in the implementation of control measures on the farm, since such measures, while requiring the cooperation (and financial participation) of the owner, is meant to protect public health, not animal health. Since March 2003, vaccination of pullets bred for the egg laying industry, against _S._ Enteritidis, has become compulsory in Israel. Its wide application since is believed to have reduced the incidence of this pathogen.A recent multi-country eggborne outbreak of _S._ Enteritidis (phage type 8) in Europe has occurred recently. Available evidence from epidemiological, microbiological, environmental, and tracing investigations identified eggs originating from 3 Polish packing centers as the vehicle of infection leading to clinical cases in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Croatia and Hungary reported a fatal case each. The outbreak peaked at the end of September 2016, shortly before the vehicle of infection was identified and control measures implemented at the farm and distribution level. Since 11 confirmed cases were reported to have travelled to Poland during the incubation period, Poland is likely to have been affected by this outbreak as well.

Enteritidis"" at <https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/documents/1188e.pdf> (thanks to Nati Elkin for the reminder).Recent examples of another zoonosis which has become subject to control measures in clinically unaffected farmed animals is LPAI H7N9 in Chinese poultry and MERS-CoV in camels. - Mod.ASMaps of Israel can be seen at <http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6292>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
