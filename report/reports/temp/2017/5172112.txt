Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Poliovirus weekly update[As of] 12 Jul 2017, WHO------------------------New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 7Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 27Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5Headlines---------- At the G20 Head of State Summit in Hamburg, Germany, [7-8 Jul 2017], leaders acknowledged the efforts to eradicate and committed to completing the job of polio eradication.- Journal of Infectious Diseases publishes supplement of articles on polio endgame and legacy implementation lessons learned and best practices.- The Global Certification Commission for the Eradication of Poliomyelitis (GCC) met on [4-5 Jul 2017] in Paris, France. This was the 16th meeting of the GCC, and the first under the group's new Chair, Professor David Salisbury from the UK, following the retirement of the previous Chair Professor Tony Adams from Australia. The meeting was attended by all 6 Regional Certification Committee (RCC) Chairs, along with partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).- In Syria, one of the previously-reported cases from Raqqa, on re-testing, has been confirmed as negative for circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), and has been removed from the list of cases. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is now 23 (22 from Deir-Al-Zour and one from Raqqa).- The Pakistan and Afghanistan National Emergency Operation Centre teams convened a coordination meeting in Amman, Jordan, on [10-11 Jul 2017]. A joint response plan was put together for new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases/isolates in the southern corridor (comprising Quetta Block/Greater Kandahar). The teams also reviewed the situation in the greater Peshawar/Nangarhar and South East Afghanistan/Southern KP-FATA Corridors and agreed on further actions to improve the quality of immunization activities and surveillance with special focus on high-risk mobile populations.- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan -- one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis case; Afghanistan -- one new WPV1-positive environmental sample. See country-specific section below for more details.Afghanistan------------ No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 4. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [16 Apr 2017] from Nawzad district, Helmand province.- One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, from Kandahar, collected on [7 Jun 2017]. It is the 6th WPV1-positive environmental sample detected in the country this year [2017]; 3 of the 6 samples are from Kandahar.- With most of Afghanistan polio-free, efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen operations, in close coordination with Pakistan, to address remaining low-level transmission in the common reservoir area of the Quetta-Kandahar transmission corridor.- Afghanistan is carrying out a programme review focusing on the implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan and making necessary adjustments for the 2nd half of 2017.Pakistan--------- One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 3. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on [11 Jun 2017], from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.- The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan.Nigeria-------- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country.- The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighbouring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger.- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin---------------- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.Central Africa--------------- No new cases were reported in the past week. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is affected by 2 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), in Haut Lomami province (2 cases, with onset of paralysis on [20 Feb 2017] and [8 Mar 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017] and [18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May [2017]).- Outbreak response plans are currently being finalised, with supplementary immunization activities using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.- The 1st mOPV2 campaign was implemented end of June ([27-29 Jun 2017]) targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 years in the 2 affected provinces.- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.- DR Congo is also affected by an Ebola outbreak, in Bas Uele province in the north of the country. Coordination among both outbreak response teams will be necessary and teams are already working on this. [The Ebola outbreak was declared over by WHO on 2 Jul 2017 - Mod.MPP]Syrian Arab Republic--------------------- In Syria, no new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. One of the previously-reported cases from Raqua [Raqqah], on re-testing, has been confirmed as negative for cVDPV2, and has been removed from the list of cases. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is now 23. All cases had onset of paralysis between [3 Mar 2017 and 28 May 2017]. 22 of the cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir-Al-Zour governorate, and 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate.- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Although access to Deir-Al-Zour is compromised due to insecurity, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, 2 campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using the bivalent oral polio vaccine ([bOPV]). However, only limited coverage was possible through these campaigns. In response to the isolation of cVDPV2 from Raqua governorate, the Syrian Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF is considering adding the area to the outbreak response, depending on whether local spread of the virus is occurring.Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 11 Jul 2017Total global cases in 2017: 7 (compared with 19 for the same period in 2016)- Total in endemic countries in 2017: 7 (compared with 19 for the same period in 2016)- Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016)- Afghanistan: 4 cases in 2017 (compared with 6 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 16-Apr-17- Pakistan: 3 cases in 2017 (compared with 13 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11-Jun-17- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21-Aug-16 Total global cases in 2016: 37- Total in endemic countries: 37- Total in non-endemic countries: 0Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 11 Jul 2017Total global cases in 2017: 27 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016)- Syrian Arab Republic: 23 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28-May-17- Democratic Republic of the Congo: 4 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 18-Apr-17- Pakistan: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17-Dec-16- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28-Oct-16- Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11-Jan-16 Total global cases in 2016: 5- Total in endemic countries: 2- Total in non-endemic countries: 3--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) confirms the media report posted on ProMED-mail on 6 Jul 2017 (see Poliomyelitis update (16): Pakistan (BA), global 20170706.5155739). Additional noteworthy information is the continued identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples in Afghanistan confirming there is continued ""silent"" circulation of the WPV1, and the stated expectation of additional cases of cVDPV to be confirmed in Syria. In addition, there is the mention that the findings of WPV1 and cVDPV in Nigeria are continued to be viewed as a threat to the region, and there are continued activities.An interactive map showing the locations of all cases of WPV and cVDPV reported in the past 6 months can be found at <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.The HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of Syria can be found atDeir Ez-Zor [Deir-al-Zour] Governorate, Syria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9043>Raqqa, Syria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/51840>and of Pakistan at:<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>(A map showing the location of Chaman town in Balochistan -- where the most recent case has been confirmed, near the Afghan border can be found at <http://tinyurl.com/ya4bxaxs>. - Mod.MPP]
