The case fatality rate for all cases is 21.5 percent and for all confirmed/probable cases is 54.4 percent, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).This has prompted the Nigerian House of Representatives to mandate its Committees on Health Institutions and Healthcare Services to investigate the recent resurgence of cases of the viral disease.The committee is expected to have an audience with the Minister of Health to brief members on the reasons for the recent outbreak and the steps taken so far to combat it. The Committees are also to interact with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and designated Lassa fever testing laboratories and report back to the House within 6 weeks for further legislative action.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The latest region in Nigeria to report Lassa fever is Borno state in the northeast part of the country which recorded its first Lassa fever outbreak in almost 5 decades.
