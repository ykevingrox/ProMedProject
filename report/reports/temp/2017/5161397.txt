THV 11 [edited]<http://www.thv11.com/news/local/case-of-tick-borne-illness-heartland-virus-found-in-arkansas-resident/454950576>Arkansas has identified its 1st case of Heartland virus [infection], a relatively new tick-borne disease, in an individual living in the northwest part of the state.People become infected with Heartland virus through the bite of the lone star tick [_Amblyomma americanum_]. Patients are most likely to be diagnosed with Heartland virus [infections] from May to September. Heartland virus causes a flu-like illness, including fever, headache, muscle aches, diarrhea, appetite loss, and feeling very tired. Most cases have low numbers of cells that fight infection and low numbers of cells that help blood clot. There is no vaccine or drug to prevent or treat the disease.""It's a flu-like illness where you're stiff, you're achy, you run a fever, you've got headaches; this one often has diarrhea, which isn't always the case with some of the others, and loss of appetite,"" said Dr. Sue Weinstein, the state public health veterinarian. ""It can get quite serious. A lot of patients with this are hospitalized, but most recover. There's only been one death in the nation, and that was in someone who was quite elderly and [had] other medical issues at the time.""In 2009, 2 people admitted to Heartland Hospital in Missouri were later found to be infected with this virus. Both recovered, but the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services began working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to learn more about the virus.To date, more than 20 cases of Heartland virus disease have been identified in several states in Southeast and South Central United States, so it is not surprising that Arkansas has a case. Most patients require hospitalization for their illness but fully recover. One patient has died. The Arkansas patient has recovered fully.Arkansas has some of the highest rates in the nation for tick-borne diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), ehrlichiosis, and tularemia. Anaplasmosis and Lyme disease may also occur. People who work or do activities outside where they are exposed to ticks or insects are more likely to be infected.Preventing bites from ticks and mosquitoes is the best way to prevent these and other infections:- Use insect repellents.- Wear long sleeves and pants.- Avoid bushy and wooded areas.- Perform thorough tick checks after spending time outdoors.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report provides a good historical summary of the occurrence of Heartland virus in the USA. Heartland virus is a tick-borne phlebovirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae family.A variety of wild mammals may serve as hosts of the virus. A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found signs that Heartland virus is circulating in deer, raccoons, coyotes and moose in 13 states, from Texas to North Carolina and Florida to Maine. In that study, serum of 1428 animals was tested, and 103 were seropositive, including 55 deer, 33 raccoons, 11 coyotes, and 4 moose. Another study found antibodies against virus nucleoproteins in 10-18 percent of samples from cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk in 24 Minnesota counties. These studies do not prove that these species are capable of infecting ticks, but it does indicate that there was enough virus replication to elicit an antibody response.Maps showing the geographic distribution of Heartland virus are accessible: at <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/10/15-0380_article#suggestedcitation>. - Mod.TYHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208>.]
