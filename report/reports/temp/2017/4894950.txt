This is no longer speculation, as an additional 5 cases have been confirmed in the past 48 hours, 4 listed as healthcare acquired (3 in patients, 1 in a healthcare worker who was asymptomatic at the time of confirmation), and 1 in a household contact. Hence, the number of cases in this outbreak in Wadi Aldawasir is now 8. It would be of interest to know whether the ""index case"" in this nosocomial outbreak has been identified through record reviews of inpatients not diagnosed as MERS-CoV infected but with clinically compatible illness in the identified healthcare facility.Wadi Wadi Al Dawasir is a town in Najd, located in the Dawasir valley in the Riyadh region. It is about 742 km (461 miles) from Riyadh by road, and 364 km (226 miles) by road from Bisha, both locations with identified MERS-CoV infected individuals in the week preceding the identification of the 1st reported MERS-CoV infected individual in Wadi Al Dawasir on 5 Mar 2017.Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of all cases reported above (including fatality and recoveries) can be found at the source URL. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia - WHO update 10 Mar 2017 for period 6-21 Feb 2017Date: 10 Mar 2017Source: WHO Emergencies, Preparedness, Response 10 Mar 2017 [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/10-march-2017-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia [10 Mar 2017]-----------------Between [6 and 21 Feb 2017] the National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 12 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) including 3 fatal cases. Four deaths among previously reported MERS cases were also reported (case numbers 1, 2, 4 and 6 in the Disease Outbreak News published on 10 Feb 2017).Detailed information concerning these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below). Most of these cases are primary cases with exposure to infected dromedary camels or consumption or their raw milk, which is the most likely source of their infection.MERS-CoV cases reported between 6-21 Feb 2017Case no. / Date report WHO / City of residence / Age / Sex / HCW / Co-morbidities / Camel exposure / Camel milk / Exposure to other cases / Date of onset of symptoms / Date of hospitalization / Date of lab confirmation / Status / Date of outcome1 / 2017-02-21 / Mahayl / 63 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-14 / 2017-02-18 / 2017-02-20 / Alive / 2017-03-102 / 2017-02-20 / Jeddah / 61 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-09 / 2017-02-18 / 2017-02-20 / Alive / 2017-03-103 / 2017-02-20 / Riaydh / 49 / M / No / No / NA / NA / NA / 2017-02-09 / 2017-02-18 / 2017-02-20 / Alive / 2017-03-104 / 2017-02-19 / Riyadh / 67 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-12 / 2017-02-16 / 2017-02-18 / Alive / 2017-03-105 / 2017-02-19 / Jeddah / 54 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-08 / 2017-02-11 / 2017-02-18 / Alive / 2017-03-106 / 2017-02-17 / Jeddah / 75/ M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-12 / 2017-02-15 / 2017-02-16 / Deceased / 2017-02-19 7 / 2017-02-13 / Almkhwah / 71 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-04 / 2017-02-12 / 2017-02-13 / Alive / 2017-03-108 / 2017-02-13 / Khyber / 53 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA / NA / 2017-02-09 / 2017-02-10 / 2017-02-12 / Alive / 2017-03-109 / 2017-02-11 / Alasyah / 80 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-03 / 2017-02-08 / 2017-02-10 / Deceased / 2017-02-2110 / 2017-02-09 / Makkah / 60 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-03 / 2017-02-06 / 2017-02-08 / Deceased / 2017-02-1011 / 2017-02-08 / Bukiriah / 54 / M / No / Yes / Yes / Yes / NA / 2017-02-03 / 2017-02-06 / 2017-02-07 / Alive / 2017-03-1012 / 2017-02-06 / Madinah / 45 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA / NA / 2017-02-01 / 2017-02-04 / 2017-02-05 / Alive / 2017-03-10 Globally, since September 2012, 1917 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 684 related deaths have been reported to WHO.WHO risk assessmentMERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As mentioned above, 1917 laboratory confirmed infections with MERS-CoV including 684 deaths have been reported to WHO since September 2012.The above WHO report contains additional information that was not previously available on the MOH MERS-CoV website: case no. 11 was reported as a recovery on 21 Feb 2017, but no report of the initial confirmation was available on the MOH website for 8 Feb 2017; case 2 was initially reported as a primary case with high risk exposures still under investigation. According to the above report, there was a history of contact with camels preceding onset of illness.For the period covered by this update, all cases had been reported as primary cases, with 9 of the 12 cases reporting a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of their illness and the other 3 cases still under investigation for possible high risk exposures.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
