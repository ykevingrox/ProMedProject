The outbreak has spread fast in 20 out of 22 Yemeni governorates in just 7 weeks, since 27 Apr 2017.Yemen is facing total collapse as the war continues. 2/3rds of the total population, around 19 million, need humanitarian and protection aid. About 10.3 million people are close to famine, and 14.5 million lack access to safe drinking water. Less than 45 percent of the country's hospitals are operational at the moment, but even the operational ones are coping with huge challenges, on top of which is a lack of medications, medical equipment and staffs.The blockade on Yemen, part of a Saudi-led bombing campaign launched in March 2015, has deepened the crisis in the country, which used to import most of its basic needs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promedd@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Sat 17 Jun 2017Source: Asharq Aawsat [edited]<https://english.aawsat.com/theaawsat/news-middle-east/number-cholera-cases-taiz-increase-due-houthi-siege>Yemeni authorities have accused insurgents of causing an increase in the number of cases of cholera infections in Taiz because of the siege in the city. They also held them responsible for blocking efforts to counter the spread of the disease in the provinces under the control of their militias.In a report issued Fri 16 Jun 2017 by the Ministry of Health in Yemen, the ministry said that its medical and epidemiological and preventive monitoring teams are facing huge difficulties to reach Sana'a, Hodeidah and Hajjah governorates where cases of illness were recently detected as a result of the control of the coup militias over these provinces. The report, published by SPA, pointed out the decline in the number of cholera cases in Dhamar, Dhale, Mahwit and Ibb governorates, noting that there are 11 provinces where cases have not been diagnosed accurately yet, whereas the number of cases has increased in Taiz, which suffers a suffocating siege by Houthi militias that hinders the work of medical teams and worsens the situation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 1054 - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
