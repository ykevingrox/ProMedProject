There have been a limited number of cases reported in the United States, throughout Brazil, and more farther south. Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis can occur after eating cooked buffalo fish purchased at a suburban grocery market, or fresh from markets or the ocean. This suggests the substance responsible for rhabdomyolysis is not changed, denatured, or altered by the heat of cooking. A toxicological agent has not been identified. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/33431>.]
