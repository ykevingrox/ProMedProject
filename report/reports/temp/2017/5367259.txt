Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-10/08/c_136663940.htm>The death toll of the cholera epidemic in war-ravaged Yemen has risen to 2151 since it broke out in late April 2017, the WHO said Sat 7 Oct 2017. A total of 800 626 people from 22 provinces out of total 23 have been infected, WHO said in a statement distributed to the local media.The death toll has increased by 24 comparing with the WHO report a week ago, while the suspected cases have risen by 33 102. Most of the deaths were reported from the northern province of Hajjah, while most of the infected cases were reported from the northwestern port province of Hodeidah on the coast of the Red Sea, both under control of Shiite Houthi rebels. Last week [29 Sep 2017], the International Committee of the Red Cross expected the epidemic to hit one million by the end of 2017.The war in Yemen, which has lasted more than 2.5 years, has destroyed the bulk of the country's water and sanitation systems, with more than half of Yemen's health facilities out of service, and about 15 million people gaining no access to safe water and basic healthcare. The war has also pushed the country into the brink of famine, with an estimated 385 000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, thus putting them at heightened risk of acute watery diarrhea and cholera, according to the UN agencies.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The continuing statistics of this record epidemic of _V. cholerae_ in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2514 May / 11 000 / 18021 May / 29 300 / 31527 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5326 Jun / 96 000 / 74614 Jun / 140 116 / 98921 Jun / 179 548 / 120528 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15007 Jul / 297 438 / 170613 Jul / 332 600 / 175920 Jul / 368 207 / 182829 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199725 Aug / 565 041 / 201830 Aug / 591 100 / 20358 Sep / 635 752 / 206217 Sep / 686 783 / 209020 Sep / 704 454 / 210324 Sep / 738 212 / 211727 Sep / 753 098 / 212229 Sep / 767 524 / 21272 Oct / 777 229 / 21344 Oct / 791 551 / 21426 Oct / 800 626 / 2151In 2015 <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.In 2016 <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/258910/1/WER9236.pdf>, the total number of cases was 132 121 from 38 countries.This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is barely 5 months old and is 6.06 times the total number of global cases of 2016 and 2.35 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.27 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. There are almost as many cases in less than 6 months than the entire 7 years of the Haitian cholera disaster. As estimates here have been suggesting for some time, the authorities estimate that the total will likely break one million by 2017's end. However, one million cases could be reached by about 23 Nov 2017, poetically the day of the American Thanksgiving.Interestingly, on 3 Oct 2017, WHO published ""Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030"" written by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control.
