Chronicle [edited]<http://www.chronicle.co.zw/fish-die-enmasse-in-mlibizi-river/>Binga district administrator Mrs Lydia Ndethi Banda said they had partnered the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Binga CPU, Binga RDC, the Environment Management Authority and ZimParks as well as traditional leaders to control the outbreak. ""I believe that we have enough resources as well as manpower to curb and control the outbreak both in humans and in animals. With the people so far so good, all seems to be totally under control now. As I speak, I'm on the ground in the villages where we are holding awareness campaigns. Areas have been quarantined on meat, especially beef, goat and we are destroying all biltong [African jerky] being sold in any market,"" said Mrs Ndethi Banda.ZimParks acting public relations officer, Mr Simukai Nyasha, said they had received a report on fish dying in Mlibizi River at the same spot where hippos reportedly died. He said investigations to establish the cause of the latest reported deaths were under way.""We have discovered dead fish in Mlibizi River at the same area where hippos died due to anthrax. Apparently 27 dead fish were picked up and samples collected and sent to the Department of Veterinary Services for analysis. During our intensified awareness campaigns we are also discouraging people from consuming the dead fish. The cause of the deaths is not yet known and we will only know the cause when the tests are concluded,"" he said. ""We suspect poisoning either by fishermen or lack of oxygen in the river.""[byline: Winnie Masara]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The results of their piscine analyses should, hopefully, be available soon.I apologize for missing this earlier report but it didn't trigger my scanning software. Being cautious about domestic livestock meats being sold in the markets is sensible. But livestock outbreaks are usually independent of wildlife ones though the commonest connection is when local villagers take their animals to graze inside national parks. This is especially common in Tanzania, but it happens all over Africa. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/833>.]
