County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency [edited]<http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/Hepatitis_A.html>Since early 2017, the Public Health Services Division in the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has been investigating a local hepatitis A outbreak. The majority of people who have contracted hepatitis A are homeless and/or illicit drug users, although some cases have been neither. The outbreak is being spread person-to-person and through contact with a fecally contaminated environment. No common sources of food, beverage or drugs have been identified that have contributed to this outbreak, though investigation is ongoing. The CDC notes that person-to-person transmission through close contact is the primary way people get hepatitis A in the USA.Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office.San Diego County Hepatitis A Outbreak Cases and Deaths as of 5 Sep 2017------------------------------Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations421 / 16 (3.8 percent) / 292 (69 percent)The table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county, only those that are local-outbreak related.

The last time a case was reported in the jails was in 2012, said Dr. Sara Cody, the county's health officer. The case involving the inmate was reported to the county Public Health Department at the end of August 2017, and on Tue 5 Sep 2017, the agency received word that a jail staff member also had contracted the disease. Officials would not say in what capacity the staff member worked.Cody said it wasn't clear whether the cases were connected. ""However, because hepatitis A can be spread from person to person, we have really leaned in and are mounting an effort to prevent any further cases through vaccination of staff and inmates,"" she said.""The good news about hepatitis A is that it usually just runs its course, and then people are fine,"" Cody said. The disease is usually spread when a person ingests fecal matter from contact with objects, food or drinks contaminated by feces or stool from an infected person, according to the CDC. It also can be sexually transmitted, usually with men who have sex with men.Infections can be prevented through careful hand washing and vaccines, the latter of which are being offered to all 3500 inmates and 1800 staff members who work in the jails. ""Our 1st concern is to our staff and the population that we care for,"" Santa Clara County Assistant Sheriff Troy Beliveau said. ""We want to make sure that we're giving everybody the proper treatment, the proper tools to prevent this from happening.""Santa Cruz and San Diego counties are both grappling with an outbreak of hepatitis A among their homeless and formerly incarcerated populations, Cody said. ""There is no increased risk to the public at large,"" Cody said about the Santa Clara County cases. ""This is confined to the jail setting.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not known whether the cases in Santa Clara county are related to the large outbreak in San Diego county. Given the time between the 2 jail cases, it unclear whether the 2nd case is a co-primary case or a secondary case.The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)--------------------------------5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5)1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4)8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3.2)15 Aug 2017 / 333 / 232 (70) / 11 (3.3)22 Aug 2017 / 352 / 246 (70) / 14 (4)29 Aug 2017 / 378 / 263 (70) / 15 (4)5 Sep 2017 / 398 / 279 (70) / 15 (3.8)12 Sep 2017 / 421 / 292 (69) / 16 (3.8)In the past week, 23 cases have been reported with one more death. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published several weeks ago (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal 20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak is continuing at a relatively stable rate of 15-20 new onset cases/week.The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the deaths occurred in those individuals. Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM [men who have sex with men] practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. No decrease seems to be occurring in the weekly number of newly reported cases. I would venture to say that 16 deaths from hepatitis A is the most in any US state for many years, let alone in 5.5 months.The San Diego County government is now recommending hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers. The vaccine recommendation has also been expanded to those who work in health care in addition to prior recommendations for those who work in public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters and behavioral and homeless service providers. The county has also set up handwashing stations in high risk areas. Given an incubation period of 15-45 days with a mean of 28 days, the immunizations, as well as increased environmental cleaning and hand washing stations, will take several weeks or more to have an effect, if at all. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
