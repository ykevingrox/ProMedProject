Seven of the 15 sewage samples collected between January and June 2017 were also HAV-positive. All sequences clustered with 2 of the 3 strains identified in the current European HAV outbreak. We demonstrate that despite an efficient vaccination program, HAV can still be transmitted to an unvaccinated high-risk population.An ongoing hepatitis A outbreak involving 15 European countries with the 1st case identified in June 2016 in the United Kingdom (UK) [1], was recently reported [2]. By June 2017, 1173 hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) were notified. In December 2016, when the 1st hepatitis A cases in Tel Aviv district were diagnosed, the local public health authority was notified and an ongoing virological, epidemiological and environmental surveillance has commenced. Here we report the current findings of [Tue 1 Jun 2017].Identification of hepatitis A virus 1a in clinical and environmental samples----------------------------------------------------------------------------Hepatitis A is a notifiable disease in Israel and only 17 sporadic cases were reported between March 2013 and December 2016 in the Tel Aviv district, when the 1st case of the current hepatitis A outbreak was identified in a hospitalized man. A case was defined as a report of an individual who had been in the Tel Aviv health district (covering the Tel Aviv metropolitan region) with a clinical presentation of abrupt onset of hepatitis (fatigue, nausea, anorexia, abnormal liver function tests) and laboratory confirmed anti-HAV (immunoglobulin M, IgM positivity) serology. By June 2017, 19 cases of HAV infection confirmed by serology were notified to the Tel Aviv district health office (Figure 1 [for figures and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Up to 17 cases were men, aged 22 to 41 years, who self-identified as MSM. One was a woman with a travel history to India during the incubation period. Of the 15 MSM, 3 had traveled to Europe, and one to the USA in the 2 months before symptom onset. A total of 15 infections were also confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing: 8 MSM were infected by the HAV 1a_ RIVM_HAV16-90 (EUROPRIDE) and 6 by the HAV 1a_ VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain; the woman was infected with an HAV 1b_India strain. The Table shows the characteristics of the patients, none of whom were vaccinated.To support the outbreak investigation, the presence of HAV sequences was assessed in sewage samples (nÛä=Ûä23) collected between August 2016 and June 2017 as part of the routine polio surveillance program [3] from 3 facilities located in the Tel Aviv area.All sewage samples collected between August and the end of December 2016 were HAV- negative. Up to 7 of the 15 samples (3/7 from the Shafdan, the sewage treatment plant of Tel Aviv, and 4/4 samples from a southern Tel Aviv pipeline), collected between January and June 2017, were found to be HAV-positive.Phylogenetic analysis of clinical and sewage HAV-positive samples showed that all sequences from the current outbreak among MSM in Israel and the 7 positive sewage samples, clustered with either RIVM_HAV16-90 (EUROPRIDE) or VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) isolates identified in the 2016-2017 European HAV outbreak [1,4,5].A total of 3 MSM were infected with the VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain and epidemiologically-linked to the same non-household venue. Moreover, sequencing results were available for 3 of 4 MSM who reported traveling in the 2 months before symptoms onset. One of them, identified with the VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain in December 2016 (week 52), was most likely infected in Berlin. Another adult MSM, harboring the RIVM_HAV16-90 (EUROPRIDE) strain and diagnosed in May 2017 (week 18), reported a stay in Poland during the incubation period. The 3rd MSM, diagnosed in late May [2017] (week 22), presented with acute hepatitis 2 weeks after returning from New York and carried the VRD_521_2016 (UK/SPAIN) strain. All other cases had not traveled abroad and were infected in Israel. HAV isolates from sewage also clustered with both HAV strains implicated in the ongoing European outbreak. In 2 of the sewage samples (9794 and 9773), both strains could be identified together. HAV sequences from past outbreaks in Tel Aviv formed a separate cluster with HAV 1b sequences (Figure 1, 2).Laboratory investigation------------------------Serum or plasma samples from acute hepatitis A cases positive for anti-HAV IgM were transferred to the national centre of HIV and viral hepatitis in the central virology laboratory of the Ministry of Health. Total nucleic acids were purified from 400 uL of plasma (or from 500 uL of filtered and concentrated sewage samples) and real-time PCR for HAV detection was performed as described previously [6]. PCR and sequencing primers of a 460-nt fragment located within the VP1/P2A region were chosen according to the HAVNET unified typing protocol [7]. Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, US) using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Raw sequence data was analysed corrected and trimmed to generate a 427-nt consensus sequence using Sequencher 5.4 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, Michigan, US). The resulting HAV sequences were aligned with the 3 distinct HAV 1a strains representing the current HAV MSM outbreak in Europe and with sequences from previously identified HAV infections in Israel. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using a neighbour-joining algorithm in MEGA, version 6 [8], with 1000 replicates for bootstrap testing.Discussion----------Hepatitis A virus infection causes a substantial number of viral hepatitis cases worldwide. It is an acute self-limiting illness, associated with fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia and jaundice, mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route [9]. A 2-dose universal toddler's vaccination program at 1.5 and 2 years of age, was initiated in Israel in 1999 and has led to an over Ûä90 percent decline in incidence of the disease [10]. However, the program cannot prevent HAV infection in high risk groups like MSM born in Israel before 1999.Between March 2012 and March 2013, there was an outbreak in the Tel Aviv district with 75 cases of acute hepatitis, of which 73 percent were in non-vaccinated young men. HAV 1b was the predominant subtype identified in clinical as well as in sewage samples collected during the outbreak [6]. In the ongoing HAV outbreak occurring in the Tel Aviv district, in non-vaccinated, MSM in the age-group of 20-45 years, 2 of the 3 strains currently circulating in MSM in Europe were identified. They were detected in clinical samples from patients and in samples collected from sewage facilities located in the Tel Aviv area. Interestingly, none of the sewage samples collected in the 5 months before the first HAV case was identified, were HAV-positive. We therefore assume that these strains did not circulate in Tel Aviv before December 2016. Moreover, a different HAV subtype, HAV 1b, dominated in the 2012-13 outbreak that affected mainly non-vaccinated injecting drug users and not MSM. The identification of individuals that reported being infected while abroad also supports the conclusion that the current outbreak was imported to Israel by traveling MSM.Anti-HAV vaccine is routinely recommended by the Israeli Ministry of Health to various risk groups, including MSM [11]. Following the identification of the 1st hepatitis A cases in MSM in Tel Aviv, we communicated about the outbreak through social media and offered free of charge vaccinations at all public health offices and sex clinics in Israel. Leaflets explaining HAV transmission and calling for anti-HAV vaccination were distributed at the venue where 3 infections occurred. Controlling the outbreak and protecting those who are not immune is complicated by undernotification as well as by possible asymptomatic HAV infection leading to continuous virus circulation. The abundance of HAV isolates in the environmental samples indicates that not all HAV cases have been identified.In the past, molecular and phylogenetic analysis of HAV-positive cases in Israel was only done in specific cases. Following the 2012-13 outbreak, the need for a national diagnostic laboratory to support public health decisions on hepatitis A was emphasized. In June 2017, the viral hepatitis reference laboratory in the central virology laboratory of the Ministry of Health was formally established and an official requirement to send IgM-positive HAV samples for molecular confirmation put in place. Thus future outbreaks are expected to be better assessed. Our findings in the MSM population together with the current reports from Europe and recently also in North America [12] call for introduction of new methodologies aiming to increase vaccination coverage specifically within this risk group.References----------1.

Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at <http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract>), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications: - men who have sex with men; - people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs; - people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; - people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates; - people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and - unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2 dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history revealed no immunization. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2615>.]
