No further cases were identified in these clusters.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[With the ending of the nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, MERS-CoV transmission seems to be slowing down to sporadic cases, classified as primary cases, some with history of contact with camels, others without well defined histories of known high risk exposures. The prior case in the Lebanese healthcare worker with no known contact with confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals in the healthcare setting, and no known contact with individuals with respiratory illnesses deserves further attention as he may well serve as a clue to all of the ""primary"" cases with previously unidentified high risk exposures. The question that constantly recurs to me (and I've mentioned before) is ""Why Saudi Arabia?"". Other countries in the region have had sporadic cases, yet Saudi Arabia reported cases account for 1672 out of 2040 cases (82 percent) reported to WHO as of 3 Jul 2017.Of note, case no.1 was not reported through the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV website as yet (and will most likely be reported when the outcome is known).The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
