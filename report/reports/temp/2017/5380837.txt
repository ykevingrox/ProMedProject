""I used to drink blood a lot."" Although she didn't know it at the time, these actions were exposing her to a lesser-known strain of tuberculosis (TB). ""As a Maasai woman I used to drink blood a lot,"" she said from her home in Kenya. ""I believe this is how I got zoonotic TB.""According to the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, while conventional TB is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, zoonotic TB is caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. It is transmitted from animals to humans primarily though unpasteurised dairy products and sometimes through eating infected under-cooked meat. It can also be transmitted from humans to other humans.[The Maasai woman] suffered. She was misdiagnosed because of the lack of awareness of this form of the disease and underwent 2 unnecessary operations. Countries across Africa and some in Asia are worst hit, according to the Union's Professor Simeon Cadmus, a zoonotic TB specialist, who said that many of these countries lack the infrastructure and capacity to correctly diagnose and treat zoonotic TB, including in his home country of Nigeria. The strain is naturally resistant to one of the most common anti-TB drugs, and patients need to be treated with a non-standard regimen for a chance of cure. But many patients are missed because people ""simply don't look for it,"" said scientific director for the Union Dr Paula Fujiwara. She said that only 2% of global TB cases are caused by zoonotic TB, but it is neglected: it is significantly under-diagnosed, especially in countries where it is most prevalent. She said that although this number might seem low, if the world wants to meet the international goal passed by the World Health Assembly to effectively end TB as a public health threat by 2030, we cannot ignore zoonotic TB.In collaboration with the World Health Organization, the World Organisation for Animal Health, and the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation, the Union launched the 1st ever Roadmap for Zoonotic TB. Countries where cattle are controlled and food safety standards are high do not have much risk, but the document, which was launched at the Union World Conference on Lung Health taking place in Mexico, outlines 10 priorities for countries where this is not the case. These include improved data collection and research to assess the true scale of the problem, improved diagnosis, and awareness of zoonotic TB. It also advocates for the routine pasteurisation of dairy products and for ensuring animal health.In South Africa, there have been multiple reports of TB in wildlife and even of transmission of zoonotic TB from a wildebeest to a veterinarian working in a private game reserve [see ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium bovis - UK: (England) ex S. Africa, animal-to-person transm., 2013 20161030.4595617], but cases among the general population are rare, according to the Department of Health's Dr Norbert Njeka, head of drug-resistant TB. However, zoonotic TB cases are not routinely reported by the department and, said Njeka, it is not on the country's public health agenda just yet.But [the Maasai patient] said that her experience shows that more global attention is needed on the issue. ""There is need for clinicians to be trained on zoonotic TB, because I underwent 2 operations because of negligence,"" she said. The doctors who removed tissue from her abdomen during her 1st operation did not send it for diagnostic tests, and she was instead treated with regular antibiotics, ""making my situation worsen and leading to the 2nd operation, which was major. This means we may be losing a lot of patients who are dying of zoonotic TB because of wrong diagnoses and yet it is a disease that is preventable, curable, and treatable.""[Byline: Amy Green]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Mycobacterium bovis_ causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in humans, an infection that is similar to infection caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb)_. Like infection caused by _M. tb_, people who are infected but not ill have what is called latent TB infection (LTBI), which can become clinically apparent (TB disease) later in life._M. bovis_ and _M. tb_ are closely genetically related, and the standard nucleic acid amplification assay will only identify _M. bovis_ as a member of the ""_M. tuberculosis_ complex,"" which includes _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_, _Mycobacterium africanum_, the Bacillus Calmette-GuÌ©rin strain (BCG), _Mycobacterium microti_, _Mycobacterium canetti_, _Mycobacterium caprae_, and _Mycobacterium pinnipedii_.Frequently many clinical laboratories do no further speciation, and the pathogen is presumed mistakenly to be _M. tb_, which can lead to misdiagnosis and widespread underreporting. Accurate speciation of isolates from clinical specimens is important for both epidemiologic and clinical reasons. _M. bovis_ is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide, a drug that is an essential component of ""short course"" therapy for infection due to drug-susceptible _M. tb_ (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by INH and rifampin for 4 months) (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab2>). If used for _M. bovis_ infection, ""short course"" therapy is likely to fail. Resistance to pyrazinamide requires a 9-month treatment duration instead of the 6-month, short-course therapy (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab2>)._M. bovis_ can infect a wide range of domesticated mammals and some wildlife, including cattle, deer, pigs, and badgers. In the U.S., it has been found in whitetail deer in northeast Michigan and Indiana. It is thought to be transmitted within herds by inhalation of infected aerosols from infected animals. _M. bovis_ is mainly transmitted to people by their consuming unpasteurized milk or dairy products (pasteurization kills _M. bovis_). _M. bovis_ can also be transmitted by inhaling aerosols of _M. bovis_ expelled in close proximity by an infected animal or person with _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection, by direct contact with infected tissue, such as what might occur during the dressing and processing of animal carcasses, and by ingestion of poorly cooked or raw tissue from an infected animal.For a further discussion of _Mycobacterium bovis_ infection, please see my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium bovis - USA: (NE) ex Mexico, airborne person-to-person transm 20160310.4083566. - Mod.ML]
