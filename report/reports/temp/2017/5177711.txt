Other common symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps/pain, bloating, increased gas, nausea, and fatigue. Vomiting, body aches, headache, fever, and other flu-like symptoms may be noted. Some people who are infected with cyclospora do not have any symptoms.If not treated, the illness may last from a few days to a month or longer. Symptoms may seem to go away and then return one or more times (relapse). It is common to feel very tired.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Previous multistate outbreaks of _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ in Canada and the United States have been linked to lettuce and other greens produced in Mexico, and as stated in the message, ""to date, no multi-jurisdictional outbreaks of cyclospora have been linked to produce grown in Canada.""ProMED 1st reported on this outbreak on 3 Jul 2017, and the source has still not been identified. - Mod.EPHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps can be accessed at:Canada: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12>,Ontario province, Canada: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>,British Columbia province, Canada: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/264>.]
