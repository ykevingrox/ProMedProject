Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person (<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/h5n1.../faqs/en/>).As per the latest WHO update on human cases of A/H5N1 avian influenza, a total of 199 cases with 167 deaths have been reported from Indonesia to date [September 2017]. This case makes a total of 200/168. It must be noted that the last 2 cases of A/H5N1 from Indonesia were reported in 2015; <http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2017_07_25_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1>.The success of avian influenza(AI) control is determined by the role and support of the whole community, especially the role of society in prevention efforts. The most important community messages are to avoid contact with birds that suddenly get sick or die; maintain personal hygiene and keep the environment clean and healthy; and to recognize the symptoms of bird flu that include fever, cough and sore throat and history of contact with sick poultry. If there are signs of AI immediately report to the clinic or hospital. - Mod.UBAThe source of infection of the victim (eg poultry farm, market, slaughterhouse, kitchen etc) has not been specified; available information will be appreciated.
