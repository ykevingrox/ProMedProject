Fox10 [edited]<http://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-news/274232084-story>A one-year-old boy is recovering at Banner Thunderbird Medical Center, after hospital officials said he contracted infant botulism over the weekend [12-13 Aug 2017]. According to a statement released by Banner Thunderbird Medical Center, infant botulism cases are rare, but potentially life-threatening. The illness affects only one to 2 infants in the county annually.It was one day before the infant's birthday when his parents noticed something was off. He stopped walking, and couldn't hold his head up.""We knew something was off, maybe he fell, hurt himself,"" said a parent. ""He couldn't hold his head up. He couldn't sit up. He was completely paralyzed.""Now, the infant is reportedly doing much better. ""He's moving more,"" said Hansberger. ""He's still on the ventilator. We were hoping to get him off, but with the scare yesterday [Tue 15 Aug 2017], right now, he is sedated.""The parent of the one-year-old hopes this serves as a warning to parents with infants to watch for any odd changes in a child's behavior, and trust your gut--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey, most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breast-fed infants can develop this entity.The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):""Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.""Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12-months-old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing.""Although not specifically stated in this post, botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG - IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.References----------1.
