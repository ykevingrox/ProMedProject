The most recent case reported prior to this case reported today (11 Jul 2017) was reported on 4 Jul 2017 (who was documented as having recovered in today's report as well). Among the questions that still remain are: - What are the high risk exposures for the cases that have been classified as primary but do not have an identifiable contact (direct or indirect) with camels and camel products?- Why Saudi Arabia and not other countries in the region where there has been documented MERS-CoV transmission?Maps showing the geographic locations within Saudi Arabia for the newly discussed case/death/recoveries can be found at the source URLs.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
