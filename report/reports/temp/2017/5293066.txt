Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Weekly Epidemiological Report 7(32) [edited]<http://www.ncdc.gov.ng/reports/weekly>2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting, 21-22 Aug 2017--------------------------------------------------------------------------Lassa fever experts from all over Nigeria and beyond gathered in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja for 2 days to review the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak and propose preparedness plans for subsequent outbreaks. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) together with the World Health Organisation and supporting partners, hosted the Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting on the 21 and 22 Aug 2017. Participants were drawn from the states affected by the outbreak this year [2017], Lassa fever treatment facilities, diagnostic laboratories, NCDC surveillance, laboratory, and health emergency response teams, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, and other key stakeholders. Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.The event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.A national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [VHF] guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.Robust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.Working groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever -- coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.The NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.--1. Lassa feverPlease note that the data reflect the routine reports, that is, all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases1.1. 19 suspected cases of Lassa fever with 4 laboratory confirmed and 2 deaths (CFR, 10.53 percent) were reported from 7 LGAs [local government areas] (9 states; Edo - 8, Kwara - 5, Ogun - 1, Ondo - 1, Oyo - 1, Plateau - 1, and Yobe - 2) in week 32 [week ending 13 Aug 2017], 2017 compared with 5 suspected cases and 2 deaths (CFR, 40 percent) reported from 5 LGAs (4 states) at the same period in 2016.1.2. Laboratory results of the 19 suspected cases were 4 positives for Lassa fever (Edo - 2, Ogun - 1, and Ondo - 1) while 9 were negative for Lassa fever and other VHFs (Edo - 6, Oyo - 1, Plateau - 1, and Yobe -2) while 5 pending (Kwara - 5).1.3. Between weeks 1 and 32 ([1 Jan-13 Aug 2017], 393 suspected Lassa fever cases with 97 laboratory confirmed cases and 58 deaths (CFR, 14.80 percent) from 74 LGAs (25 states) were reported compared with 787 suspected cases with 75 laboratory confirmed cases and 90 deaths (CFR, 11.44 percent) from 128 LGAs (27 states) during the same period in 2016 (Figure 1 --[available at the source URL above]).1.4. Between weeks 1 and 52 2016, 921 suspected Lassa fever cases with 109 laboratory confirmed cases and 119 deaths (CFR, 12.92 percent) from 144 LGAs (28 states and FCT) were reported compared with 430 suspected cases with 25 laboratory confirmed cases and 40 deaths (CFR, 9.30 percent) from 37 LGAs (14 states and FCT) during the same period in 2015 (Figure 2).1.5.

Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY]
