EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]This is a comment received from an EpiCore member in response to: Re: Undiagnosed virus - Egypt: RFI 20170315.4903834The symptoms of the 11 cases of illness reported earlier apparently were vomiting and diarrhea, and colic, identified in children and elderly of 2 families. It has been suggested by the MOH that these are due to suspected water poisoning, following testing of environmental and clinical samples, and not a virus as originally stated. A total of 6 cases improved and were discharged, but 3 children died.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There have been no further reports of illness or death, but certainly this situation should be closely watched. It has been reported that laboratory tests are being conducted to detect viruses, bacteria, toxins, heavy metals, testing of insects and disease vectors, monitoring and measuring air pollutants, and testing food items (Avian flu diary num. 12,321 <http://afludiary.blogspot.com/>). It is hoped that such thorough epidemiological investigation will be helpful in further clarifying the etiologic agent causing this cluster of illness. It is good news that it has not spread outside the 2 households, but it is still not clear why secrecy surrounded this episode of illness. ProMED thanks the contributors to Epicore who submitted this information on the undiagnosed cluster of cases in Egypt.
