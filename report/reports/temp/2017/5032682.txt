The Ministry of Health confirmed that now there are 11 cases in the Los Lagos region.The 33-year-old affected woman died in recent hours in the Thorax Hospital in Santiago. It was the Health SEREMI [local ministerial unit], EugenÌ a Schnake, who confirmed the fatal outcome.The health authority also stated that a meeting with the neighbors will be held this coming week [week of Sun 7 May 2017] to clear up any doubts which might arise.Of those 11 confirmed cases of hantavirus infection in the region, 2 people have lost their lives, according to the details given by the authorities.[Byline: Carina Almarza]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The report above does not indicate if the hantavirus etiology of her disease was laboratory confirmed or if the diagnosis was based on clinical criteria. Although reports of this and the previous cases that have occurred in the Los Lagos region provided no information about the circumstances under which the hantavirus infection might have been acquired, in the current case the woman had been living in an area that is habitat of the rodent that may well have been the source of her infection. The other cases also may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in this environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in this endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Chile (Araucania region)Date: Tue 2 May 2017Source: Cooperativa [in Spanish, trans.

An official has since confirmed that the patient died.Hantavirus is spread by the droppings of deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] and can lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but deadly illness that is fatal in 36 percent of cases.The Franklin County case was the 4th in Washington this year [2017]. It is the 3rd reported case in the county since 1996.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[Although the specific hantavirus involved in this case is not stated, it is undoubtedly Sin Nombre virus. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including Washington state. Deer mice commonly move into dwellings and other buildings with the onset of cold weather and may remain there through the winter. Cleaning out deer mouse nests should be done with the precautions. Materials, should be wetted down with a bleach solution, materials handled in an open air space, with gloves and a mask worn.Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus and shed it in feces, urine, and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.A map showing the location of Washington state in the northwest of the lower 48 USA states can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4512> King County can be seen on the map at<http://geology.com/county-map/washington-county-map.gif>. - Mod.TY]******[4] USA Colorado, suspectedDate: Tue 2 May 2017Source: Garfield County [edited]<https://garfield-county.com/news/5-2-17-hantavirus-case-in-Garfield-County.aspx>Garfield County Public Health is investigating a case of hantavirus in a local resident. Hantavirus is a serious lung infection caused by viruses found in the saliva, urine, and droppings of some rodents, including deer mice. It can be found throughout the country, with a higher prevalence of occurrence in the southwestern part of the United States.""The individual who locally suffered exposure has been released from the hospital, but little else about this infection case is known at this time,"" said Danielle Yost, Public Health nurse. ""Public Health is working to determine in which part of the county this exposure occurred; however, it is important to remember that exposure to [Sin Nombre] hantavirus can happen throughout Garfield County.""Springtime poses an increased risk to residents annually, as they begin to clean spaces where deer mice may have taken up residence during the past winter.Hantavirus infections, though rare, can be extremely dangerous. Colorado has the 2nd highest prevalence in the nation for the disease. The mortality rate for this illness is nearly 40 percent. The general population may have a low risk of coming into contact with [Sin Nombre] hantavirus, but when someone does, it can have very serious consequences.""When people are opening up spaces that have obvious signs of mice we tell them to stop until they can use proper cleaning techniques,"" said Yost. ""If you see signs of mice, avoid vacuuming and sweeping, or doing anything that stirs up dust,"" she added. Instead, ventilate the area, and always wet surfaces down with a bleach water solution of a cup and a half of bleach in one gallon water. Keep the area wet for 5 minutes before beginning clean up. Use gloves to wipe up and safely discard all contaminated material.Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused when a person breathes in dust that may contain particles of rodent urine and droppings. It takes an average of 2-4 weeks for symptoms of hantavirus [infection] to appear. Early flu-like symptoms include fever, fatigue, and muscle aches.Those who have had exposure to mice or mice droppings and who exhibit symptoms of illness should seek medical attention, and tell a doctor of the rodent or particle exposure. There is no specific cure for hantavirus [infection], but individuals who receive early treatment may have a better chance of recovery.According to Yost, ""We want to emphasize that we live in a high risk area for hantavirus. It is important to take the recommended precautions when cleaning, to decrease the risk of exposure.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report does not indicate under what conditions the suspected case might have acquired a hantavirus infection. If the case is confirmed, it is doubtless due to Sin Nombre hantavirus infection. The spring season currently underway often brings with it sporadic cases of hantavirus infections, as cabins and other buildings unused over the winter are opened up and cleaned. In the western USA, the virus responsible for these cases is Sin Nombre.Maps showing the location of Colorado in the USA can be accessed at <http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/usstates/co.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209>, and a map showing Colorado counties at <http://geology.com/state-map/colorado.shtml>. - Mod.TY][A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209>.]
