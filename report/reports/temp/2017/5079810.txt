In a report to the Sudanese parliament, the minister warned against increase of watery diarrhea infections and deterioration of the health conditions, saying ""we expect the worse with the rainy season.""According to the minister's report, Sudan's White Nile State registered the highest rate of infection with the disease that reached 4512 cases, attributing that to the fact that the state is neighboring South Sudan. Blue Nile State comes 2nd with 4471 infections and 12 deaths, followed by Sinnar State with 2401 infections and 14 deaths, according to the report.Khartoum State has registered 19 death cases and 878 infections within 10 months, it said. The Red Sea State registered 1137 infections and 19 death cases, while the Gezira State registered 55 deaths and 982 infections.The minister called for strengthening supervision of the Nile water sources and revising the water networks to ensure provision of clean water for the affected areas. Contaminated drinking water is responsible for the spread of the disease which appears every now and then in many areas in Sudan.During August and September 2016, watery diarrhea hit Sudan's Blue Nile and other states, leaving more than 55 dead with 2619 infection cases.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - SudanDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017Source: Radio Dabanga [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201706020148.html>On [Tue 30 May 2017], Khartoum state saw the death of 2 people from cholera and infection of 120 others amid medical concerns over the spread of the potentially fatal disease to the residents of the national capital.

In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press) oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
