yrian Observatory for Human Rights [edited]<http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=64121>[There have been] more than 400 casualties and injuries in the successive [attacks] carried out by warplanes in 3 Syrian cities.[The death toll has risen] to 99 at least, as documented by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Mon 4 Apr 2017. They were killed by raids carried out by warplanes in several Syrian areas.The Syrian Observatory documented the deaths of 37 children under the age of 18, 20 citizen women over the age of 18, in addition to 42 young men killed in the raids that targeted the cities of Khan Shaykhun, Salqeen and Jisr al-Shughur south, west and north of Idlib province.Also involved were the cities and towns of Douma, Saqba, KafrBatna, Hamuriya and Jesrin in the Eastern Ghouta, where 58 civilians including 19 children and 13 citizen women were killed in bombing by warplanes on Khan Shaykhun, a city south of Idlib province.The medical sources confirmed that one of the neighborhoods of Khan Shaykhun city was bombed with material believed to be gas, which caused suffocation and other symptoms like intense breathing secretion [difficulty breathing and pulmonary edema], iris shrinkage [pinpoint pupils], paleness, general spasms [convulsions], and other symptoms that appeared on the injured people.Additionally, 16 people including 11 children and 2 citizen women were killed in the raids that targeted Salqeen city, and 5 civilians were killed in the raids that targeted Jisr al-Shughur city west of Idlib province. Another 20 citizens including 7 children and 5 citizen women were killed in the targeting of the cities and towns of Douma, Saqba, KafrBatna, Hamuriya, and Jesrin in the Eastern Ghouta.The death toll may increase in most of the areas that were bombed because there are currently missing people, and because there are more than 300 wounded and injured people in the above mentioned areas, where some of them are still in dangerous situations, while others have suffered permanent disabilities and deformities.--Communicated by:Phili Henika<philiphe@yahoo.com>[More information on the chemicals and clinical information can be found on ProMED-mail post ""Chemical weapons - Syria (03): sarin gas 20170404.4947953."" - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>.]
