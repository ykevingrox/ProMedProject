Of special concern this year [2017] is a recent mosquito invader known as the Asian Tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_), which, according to Burk, has potential to be a carrier of the infamous Zika virus, which has plagued South Florida, Texas and other subtropical regions of the United States. Dr. Burk says the Asian Tiger mosquito also has been recorded in Southeast Nebraska.What remains a greater concern in the Midwest is the West Nile Virus (WNV), carried by the Northern House mosquito (_Culex pipiens_ and _Culex tarsalis_), with a total of 94 reported cases since 2012 in Nebraska alone, and 2038 cases reported nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control.Dr. Burk believes that the best prevention from contracting mosquito-borne illness is to reduce standing water, where mosquitoes can hatch and become adults within 7 to 10 days. He offers the following precautionary measures:- Get rid of potential mosquito-breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets and barrels.- Change water in pet dishes regularly and replace the water in bird baths weekly.- Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Keep children's wading pools empty and on their sides when they aren't being used.- Plant mosquito-repelling vegetation such as lavender, catnip, lemon balm, citronella, peppermint or basil.- Wear light-colored or white clothing, as mosquitoes are more attracted to dark clothing. Long sleeves and pants also can help deter bites.- Use insect repellent that contains the chemical [DEET]. An effective alternative is a non-[DEET] mixture of lemon oil and eucalyptus, which also can be found over-the-counter.- Mosquitoes that carry the WNV are most active at dusk and dawn. Limit time outdoors during these hours.- Make sure you have good screens on your windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.At its worst, some people develop severe symptoms from WNV including high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis. Others have less severe symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting and sometimes swollen lymph glands or skin rash on the chest, stomach and back. Dr. Burk notes that most people who are infected with the virus will not show any symptoms at all.""The main, peak wave of infection passed through a few years ago, but we still have cases every year. Most of them are asymptomatic, but occasionally cases can be severe and lead to serious conditions like arthritis or other long-lasting, lingering problems,"" said Burk. [WNV infections can lead to encephalitis and death. Survivors of encephalitis can suffer neurologic sequelae. - Mod.TY][Byline: Patti Jo Peterson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report does not say when _Ae. albopictus_ was 1st discovered in Nebraska. The eggs of this mosquito can enter into diapause and survive winter conditions. This mosquito has been extending its range northward, and this extension is expected to continue as winter temperature rise over time. It has been recently found in the northern states of Ohio and Indiana. Although _Ae. albopictus_ is a Zika virus vector, because it is not a strict human biter, unlike _Ae. aegypti_, it is not as great a risk for infecting people as is _Ae. aegypti_. Fortunately, _Ae. aegypti_ does not occur in Nebraska. West Nile virus is endemic in Nebraska, as the above report indicates, will continue to cause sporadic cases of disease in humans and equine animals. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229>.]
