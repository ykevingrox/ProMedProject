On 24 May 2017, 22 of them, were admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH), while remaining patients are also expected to reach to STIDH soon. According to patients, close to 100 relatives participated in the ceremony on that day. Symptoms such as watery diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, headache, fever developed 8-12 hours after eating Prasad. They are now in stable condition and are currently under medical care.Every year, several foodborne outbreaks are reported in Nepal. However, identification of the cause of these outbreaks has never been attempted or achieved by the concerned authorities.--Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research UnitSukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease HospitalKathmanduNepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[As written by Dr Pun who ProMED thanks for his submission, it is not likely that an etiology will be identified, but with fever associated with vomiting and diarrhea, an etiology such as salmonellosis may be behind the episode. Bacterial toxin associated enteric diseases, such as those linked to _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Clostridium perfringens_, are not generally associated with fever. - Mod.LLMaps of Nepal can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_Federal_States> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18543>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ][See Also:Clostridium perfringens foodborne illness - USA: (IN) restaurant, fatal, 2016 20170512.5031182Foodborne illness - France (02): (ND) schoolchildren, cheese 20170508.5021628Foodborne illness - USA (02): CDC, 2013-2016 20170501.5004885Foodborne illness - France: (ND) schoolchildren 20170428.5001309Foodborne illness - India (02): (BR) RFI 20170417.4975686Foodborne illness - Colombia: (BL) inmates, RFI 20170415.4959930Foodborne illness - Cambodia: (BA) soy milk, RFI 20170407.4956397Foodborne illness - India: (KL) police, fish curry, RFI 20170402.4942801Foodborne illness - Lebanon: (BA) schoolchildren, RFI 20170402.4941722Foodborne illness - Egypt (04): schoolchildren 20170324.4923928Foodborne illness - Egypt (03): schoolchildren, RFI 20170323.4921318Foodborne illness - Egypt (02): (SJ) schoolchildren 20170316.4905429Foodborne illness - Egypt: (SJ) schoolchildren, RFI 20170315.4902833Foodborne illness - South Africa: (EC) nursing home, fatal, RFI 20170314.4899809Foodborne illness - Japan (02): (Tokyo area), nori, norovirus 20170302.4874642Foodborne illness - Canada: (MB) healthcare lecture catering 20170227.4868222Foodborne illness - Japan: (Tokyo area) RFI 20170223.4852615Foodborne illness - USA: (FL) science olympiad, staphylococcal 20170210.4830795Bacillus cereus foodborne illness - Taiwan: (TP) 20170115.47676962015----Foodborne illness - Nepal: (MH), RFI 20150405.32754082007----Foodborne illness, fatal, boar - Nepal (02): trichinellosis susp. 20070320.0984Foodborne illness, fatal, boar - Nepal: trichinellosis susp., RFI 20070319.0962].................................................ll/mj/lxl"
