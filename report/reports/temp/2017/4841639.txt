""The symptoms were like cholera, but it is still not conclusive for we still need additional laboratory tests,"" she said. The team's initial findings, Gamboa said, specifically named a water parasite to be the cause of the disease. ""Initially, the parasite from their water is normal.""Gamboa added that since 2014, a total of 10 Lumad -- 2 adults and 8 children -- died due to the outbreak when they returned to their community after spending more than a year of refuge in Davao city. In sum, the outbreak already claimed 28 lives since December 2016. Of the 28, 18 were children. Those who died were several Lumad who stayed at the United Church of Christ of the Philippines -- Haran Compound.""The water here [Davao] is chlorinated, the water in Talaingod is fresh from the spring,"" Gamboa said referring to what the Lumad told them about the comparison of the water from 2 different sources.[Byline: Earl O Condeza]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is likely that this outbreak was cholera. - Mod.LLMaps of the Philippines can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/z4y3p5v> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/15457>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
