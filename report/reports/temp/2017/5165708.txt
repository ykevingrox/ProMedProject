A total of 313 538 suspected cases of cholera have been registered in 21 Yemeni provinces, the WHO said on [Tue 11 Jul 2017]. The northwestern Hajjah province is the hardest-hit by the disease, while the southern province of Socotra remains the only Yemeni province where the cholera epidemic has not spread.Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sana'a. In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government. According to UN officials, more than 10 000 people have been killed in the war, while more than 11 percent of the country's population has been displaced as a direct result of the conflict.[Byline: Zakaria al-Kamali]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the dreadfully impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 150004 Jul / 275 987 / 163407 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 1732In the last complete year of data (2015), WHO (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf?ua=1>) reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
