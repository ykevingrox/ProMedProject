Goorhuis <a.goorhuis@amc.uva.nl> [edited]          GeoSentinel siteOn [16 May 2017], a 58-year old Caucasian male patient without significant medical history was diagnosed with Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), 2 days after returning from a 12-day trip to Tanzania [3-14 May 2017]. He had travelled in a group of high school teachers and students, consisting of 3 adult teachers (including the patient) and 12 children aged between 15 and 17 years. The group had arrived in Tanzania on [3 May 2017] (Dar-Es-Salaam) and then traveled to Mwanza on [4 May 2017]. On [5 May 2017], the group made a safari trip from Mwanza to the northwestern part of the Serengeti National Park (between Ndabaka Gate and Kirawira 2 Special Camp) returning to Mwanza the same day. They stayed in Mwanza from [6 May 9 May 2017] and made another car trip to the direct south of Mwanza on [10 May 2017]. They remained in Mwanza until their return to Dar-Es-Salaam on [13 May 2017]. The group returned in Netherlands on [14 May 2017]. All the members of the group used malaria chemoprophylaxis as recommended.Before returning to The Netherlands, on [12 May 2017]., the patient felt tired and on that day, he first noticed a swelling on the calf muscle of his left leg. During the return flight to The Netherlands on the night from [13 to 14 May 2017], he developed spiking fevers and chills.On [16 May 2017]., his general practitioner referred him to the Gelre Hospital in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, to rule out malaria. The thick blood smear showed no plasmodia, but moving structures, diagnosed as _Trypanosoma brucei_, upon which the patient was transferred to The Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam for further diagnosis and treatment.On admission, he mentioned that he had suffered several insect bites, but did not recall a specific insect. He felt tired, but had no other specific complaints. Upon physical examination, he was not acutely ill, with a temperature of 38.4 deg C [approx.101 deg F]. A sharply marked dark red colored inoculation chancre was present on the calf muscle of his left leg (3 x 3,5 cm). There were no clinical symptoms and signs of CNS involvement. Laboratory tests showed normal hemoglobin (8.7 mmol/l), thrombocytopenia (56 x 109/l) and leukocytopenia (2.0 x 109/l), with left-shift. ALAT (59 IU/l) and LDH (436 U/l) were slightly elevated, other liver enzymes were within normal range. Serum creatinine was normal (93 micromol/l).Thick and thin blood smear, as well as quantative buffy coat examination all showed living trypanosomes. Additional molecular tests are pending. Lumbar puncture did not show a cell reaction and no trypanosomes were observed. The diagnosis of HAT by _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_, in the early hematolymphatic stage, was made.A collaborate effort of many tropical medicine specialists, simultaneously present at the 15th congress of the International Society of Travel Medicine in Barcelona, Spain, led to rapid identification of available stock of the required treatment drug suramin, at the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel, which was quickly dispatched to Amsterdam by Dr. Hatz and his team. Through this collaborate effort, the patient could be started on treatment within 12 hours after arrival at our hospital. The other members of the travel group will be notified to seek medical attention should they develop similar complaints.On behalf of the AMC treatment team and with many thanks to all involved,--A.

Goorhuis and colleagues for submitting this report. _Trypanosoma rhodesiense brucei_ is always a risk in areas with a large wildlife population especially of buffaloes.The last report of trypanosomiasis imported to Europe from Tanzania was in 2012 (see below). The WHO map of countries with human trypanosomiasis from 2014 (latest) indicate that Tanzania was free at that time from human trypanosomiasis (<http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/country/en/>). - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/200>.][See Also:2016----Trypanosomiasis, African - USA: (MD) ex Botswana, Zambia: 20161226.47237522015----Trypanosomiasis, African - Canada: ex Zambia 20150904.36250052014----Trypanosomiasis, African - Zambia: (LS) 20140428.2435399Trypanosomiasis - Kenya: (Masai Mara): CDC alert 20120317.1073176Trypanosomiasis - Belgium: ex Kenya (Masai Mara) 20120222.1049305Trypanosomiasis, human - Germany ex Kenya: Masai Mara 20120202.1031130Trypanosomiasis - Angola: (CN) 20120125.10217612012Trypanosomiasis - Sweden ex Tanzania: 20121222.14651812010----Trypanosomiasis, African - Zambia: (EA) 20101111.4093Trypanosomiasis - USA ex Zambia: (EA) 20100915.33382009----Trypanosomiasis - Netherlands ex Tanzania (SE) 20090724.2613Trypanosomiasis - Poland ex Uganda (Queen Elizabeth NP) 20090810.28442008----Trypanosomiasis, African - Tanzania: (NW) 20081103.34552008----Trypanosomiasis, African - Tanzania: (NW) 20081103.34552007----Trypanosomiasis - South Africa ex Malawi (02) : 20071120.3754Trypanosomiasis - South Africa ex Malawi: 20070212.05322005----Trypanosomiasis - South Africa ex Malawi (Kasungu Natl.
