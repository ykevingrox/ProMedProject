The populace of VitÌ ria da Conquista issued a complaint about the lack of vaccine against the disease in the region.According to the Secretariat, although the road flow is not an indication for population vaccination, due to the daily migratory intensity and the strong health relations between the 2 regions, VitÌ ria da Conquista was included in the list of cities for a selective vaccination intensification.The other municipalities that must vaccinate 100 percent of their populations are: Angical, BaianÌ polis, Barra, Barreiras, Bom Jesus da Lapa, Brejolandia, Buritirama, Campo Alegre de Lourdes, CanÌÁpolis, Carinhanha, Casa Nova, Catolandia, Cocos, Coribe, Correntina, Cotegipe, CristÌ polis, Feira da Mata, Formosa do Rio Preto, Ibotirama, ItaguaÌ¤u da Bahia, IuiÌ¼, Jaborandi, Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, Malhada, Mansidao, MorparÌÁ, MuquÌ©m de Sao Francisco, Paratinga, Pilao Arcado, Remanso, Riachao das Neves, Santa Maria da VitÌ ria, Santa Rita de CÌÁssia, Santana, Sao DesidÌ©rio, Sao FÌ©lix do Coribe, Sento SÌ©, Serra do Ramalho, Serra Dourada, SÌ tio do Mato, Sobradinho, Tabocas do Brejo Velho, Wanderley, Xique-Xique.--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>******[2] Espirito Santo state confirmedDate: Tue 24 Jan 2017, 7:07 AMSource: G1 [in Portuguese, trans.

So far, all human cases have been reported as spill-over transmission from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission. These cases are being investigated to determine if any are due to urban, _Aedes aegypti_ transmission. Vaccination campaigns are being focused on the areas where these human and monkey cases have occurred, in a prudent effort to prevent urban transmission.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Brazil can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5649>. - Mod.TY]
