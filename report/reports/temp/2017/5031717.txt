AllAfrica [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201705120121.html>A slaughterhouse in Makongeni, Thika has been shut down after 6 people were admitted at Thika level 5 Hospital following an anthrax outbreak suspected to have emanated from the abattoir.Kiambu County Chief Officer Health Stephen Njuguna told Nation by yesterday evening [Wed 10 may 2017] they had 6 reported cases. He told Nation that county is finalizing on the full report of the cases and will give an updated report once it is done.Medical Superintendent at the Thika facility, Andrew Toro, says the 1st patient was brought to hospital on [Fri 5 May 2017] last week with symptoms of the bacterial infection. They had skin lesions and blood tests on the patients confirmed they were infected with the disease -- which affects herbivorous mammals such as cows and goats -- and were immediately put on treatment in an isolation room.The patients are said to be meat loaders at the slaughter house. The 1st patient is said to have been pricked by a bone as he worked at the slaughter house while the 3 others are said to have come into skin contact with an infected carcass. It is not yet clear where the other 2 got infected.[Byline: Eunice Kilonzo and Mary Wambui]--Communicated by:Eric Favre EricUniversity of Liverpool and International Livestock Research Institute<Fevre@liverpool.ac.uk>[Kiambu is North West of Nairobi; see <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/22/Kihingo.html>Also Wikipedia for Thika:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thika>Our thanks to Eric for this latest report. Kenyan news has been abuzz with reports on this event which has now been confirmed as anthrax; see:<http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/05/11/kiambu-health-official-allays-fears-of-anthrax-outbreak-in-thika_c1559735><https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001239379/fears-of-anthrax-outbreak-as-six-hospitalised>Anthrax is enzootic in the Central Province of Kenya with multiple outbreaks reported each year since 2001. A provincial if not a national anthrax control and surveillance programme is overdue.The confirmation quoted in this latest report is based on clinical history, skin lesions, and blood tests, presumably stained blood smears. I have assumed that these men were infected while moving ""meat loaders"" of bovine carcasses; carcasses are mentioned and how else would one be ""pricked"" by a bone. The meat inspectors on the slaughter line must have been present in name only to have not recognized that this animal was grossly ill and with an enlarged bloody spleen, for starters. Frankly this is a 1st for me. Exposure in an abattoir or slaughterhouse is logical but most uncommon. The reports we post are virtually all in relation to informal shade-tree slaughter and butchering or butcher slabs in a village well outside the formal regulated structure. I would not be surprised if this carcass is still hanging in the abattoir chiller. If it has been butchered into market cuts, we will see reports of further cases. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13423>.]
