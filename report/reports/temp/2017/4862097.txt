KazTag, The Kazakh Telegraph Agency [edited]<http://www.kaztag.kz/en/news/detail.php?ID=525902>The culprits of anthrax outbreak last year [2016] in Pavlodar region have been sentenced to custodial restraint. ""The suspects admitted their fault. The court of Irtysh district sentenced them to 1.5 years custodial restraint,"" said the press-service of Pavlodar region's court.In July 2016, 3 people were taken to regional infection hospital of Irtysh district. A 51-year-old villager died. Police revealed that an inhabitant of Abasov village did not discover the cause of abnormal cow behavior and butchered it for further sale, without veterinary notification. 117 kg of meat were sold to Maira cafe, Irtyshk village.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The outbreak referred to was reported by OIE on 16 Jul 2016; see Anthrax - Kazakhstan (08): (AS) bovine, OIE 20160712.4339916. To read the original OIE report, which includes a good map of Kazakhstan showing the location of this northerly outbreak, go to <http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20454>As I commented at the time, it is unusual to see outbreaks in this northern region of Kazakhstan, on the border with Russia. Guessing, I would speculate that the recent eccentric outbreaks outside the normally affected oblasts has stimulated an increased awareness resulting in this case being observed and reported. They do state that there was an outbreak thereabouts in 2010. Hopefully the vaccination response will discourage further outbreaks.2016 was a bad year for anthrax in Kazakhstan. They have an active livestock vaccination programme, and usually the disease is barely sporadic with just the occasional affected animal, usually a bovine; single cows were affected in 2012, 2011, and 2010. There was a previous bovine case reported in Pavlodar in June, 2010. See references below starting with 26 Jun 2010 Anthrax, human, bovine - Kazakhstan: (PA) 20100626.2132. It was a sick bull which was butchered and the meat distributed, resulting in one human death, 4 clinical cases, and 6 undergoing preventive treatment.One of the problems with an infrequently reported disease is that folk get casual, they forget the risk, reporting is not urgent, and therefore circumstances can get out of control quickly. It seems counter-intuitive to state that as a disease begins to disappear the reporting and awareness must be greatly increased. Otherwise the disease can get away from you and all the benefits of the previous 5-10 years are lost. Pick any infectious disease whether of animals or humans, and you can add chapter and verse to what I have stated. - Mod.MHJMaps of Kazakhstan can be seen at <https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/img/kazakhstan_map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58378>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
