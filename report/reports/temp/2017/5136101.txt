Seven of the 13 newly reported cases are health care workers.Cluster 1This Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cluster is currently occurring in a hospital, Riyadh city, Riyadh region. An additional 9 cases have been reported in this cluster including 3 health care workers. In total, 32 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO are associated with this cluster to date. All of the asymptomatic cases are in home isolation and all symptomatic cases are isolated on a hospital ward.Cluster 2No newly reported cases are associated with cluster 2 as reported in the Disease Outbreak News published on 13 Jun 2017.Cluster 3This MERS cluster is currently occurring in a 3rd hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. In addition to the cases previously reported in the Disease Outbreak News published on 13 Jun 2017, the cluster involves 4 newly reported cases. To date, this cluster involves, including the suspected index case, 8 laboratory confirmed patients all of them are health care workers, including the 4 newly reported cases described in the separate document (see below).Globally, 2029 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 704 related deaths have been reported to WHO.Public health responseThe Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia is evaluating each case and their contacts and implementing measures to limit further human-to-human transmission and bring these outbreaks to a control. These measures include: - Proper isolation for all confirmed cases (home isolation for asymptomatic patients, in hospital for symptomatic patients). - Active tracing for all contacts of patients, health care workers and community contacts. - Identification of high and low risk contacts with daily monitoring for all during incubation period of the 14 days and performing laboratory testing for high risk contacts, regardless of the development of symptoms; multiple laboratory testing is conducted during the follow-up period. - Regular updating of the line list of cases and contacts and conducting epidemiological analysis of data to identify the source of infection, links between patients and reasons for MERS-CoV spread in the hospitals. - Investigation of suspected cases between patients and health care workers based on case definition of MERS. - Enforcement of strict adherence to proper environmental cleaning, disinfection and terminal cleaning and disinfection for hospital environment with special care to the departments where the outbreaks are currently occurring or have occurred. - Enforcement of visual triage for respiratory diseases in emergency department and outpatient departments and ensure the 24/7 availability of a trained nurse for early detection of patient with respiratory symptoms, and proper documentation in triage form. - Extensive training of all health care workers on case definition for early detection, implementation of isolation precautions, proper selection, donning and doffing of PPEs, hand hygiene and environmental cleaning and disinfection. - Ensuring that all health care workers tested for N95 fitting (fit test). - Ensuring availability of infection prevention supplies including hand sanitizer, PPEs, surface disinfectants, portable HEPA filters and fumigation machines. - Enforcing the implementing of a policy of not allowing health care workers to travel without medical clearance to prevent the spread of the virus to other countries.WHO risk assessmentMERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. Preliminary investigations of the clusters described above indicate that secondary cases are linked to 2 events where aerosolizing procedures were conducted in crowded medical wards under sub-optimal infection prevention and control conditions.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.WHO adviceBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.Line listing of newly confirmed cases from 11-15 Jun 2017Case no. / Date report WHO / City of residence / Age / Sex / HCW / Co-morbidities / Camel exposure / Camel milk / Exposure to other cases / Date of onset of symptoms / Date of hospitalization / Date of lab confirmation / Status / Date of outcome1 / 2017-06-11	/ Riyadh / 35 / M / Yes / No / No / No / YesÛÊ / NA / NA / 2017-06-10 / Alive2 / 2017-06-11 / Riyadh / 57 / M / Yes / Yes / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-07 / 2017-06-08 / 2017-06-10 / Alive3 / 2017-06-11 / Riyadh / 42 / F / Yes / No / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-08 / 2017-06-09 / 2017-06-10 / Alive4 / 2017-06-11	/ Riyadh / 54 / F / Yes / No / No / No / YesÛÊ / NA / NA / 2017-06-10 / Alive5 / 2017-06-11 / Riyadh / 39 / M / Yes / No / No / No / YesÛÊ / NA / NA / 2017-06-10 / Alive6 / 2017-06-12 / Riyadh / 45 / F / Yes / No / No / No / YesÛÊ / NA / NA / 2017-06-11 / Alive7 / 2017-06-13	 / Riyadh / 58 / M / No / Yes / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-12 / 2017-05-27* / 2017-06-13 / Alive8 / 2017-06-13 / Riyadh / 53 / F / Yes / No / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-11 / 2017-06-12 / 2017-06-13 / Alive9 / 2017-06-14 / Riyadh / 70 / F / No / Yes / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-10 / NA / 2017-06-14 / Alive10 / 2017-06-14 / Riyadh / 59 / M / No / Yes / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-12 / 2017-05-27* / 2017-06-14 / Alive11 / 2017-06-14 / Riyadh / 47 / M / No / Yes / NA / NA / NA / 2017-06-06 / 2017-06-11 / 2017-06-13 / Alive12 / 2017-06-15 / Hail City / 29 / M / No / Yes / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-12 / 2017-06-14 / 2017-06-15 / Alive13 / 2017-06-15 / Riyadh / 79 / M / No / Yes / No / No / YesÛÊ	 / 2017-06-13 / 2017-06-01* / 2017-06-15 / Alive14 / 2017-06-15 / Riyadh / 67 / M / No / Yes / No / No / YesÛÊ / 2017-06-13 / 2017-05-28* / 2017-06-15 / AliveÛÊCase was detected through contact tracing of a previous MERS-CoV case.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[According to the WHO update, there have now been 2029 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported globally including at least 704 related deaths reported to WHO.In summary there are 3 concurrent nocomial outbreaks ongoing in Riyadh involving 3 hospitals in Riyadh. The 1st outbreak/cluster has identified 32 laboratory confirmed cases of whom 9 were identified in the above update. The 2nd outbreak/cluster has not reported new cases in the above update, and the 3rd outbreak/cluster there are 8 laboratory confirmed cases, all of whom are healthcare workers (4 of whom were newly reported in the above update).Of note in this update is the mention that the nosocomial outbreaks relate to 2 separate events with aerosolizing procedures - a reminder of some of the nosocomial associated super spreader events during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.Additional updated information on cases identified in the above provided line listing is that cases nos. Twelve and 13 were reported to have died - case no.12 on 17 Jun 2017 and case no. Up to 13 on 25 Jun 2017. Cases nos. 9, 10, and 14 were noted to be in critical condition at the time of their initial confirmation reports. Case no.11 is reported in the above report as a 47-year-old, whereas the initial confirmation report on the Saudi MOH website mentions the case is 40-years-old. Cases no. 1, 3, and 8 were reported to have recovered, case no.1 on 17 Jun 2017, case 3 either 22 or 25 Jun Jun 2017 (there were 2 42-year-old female healthcare workers), and case 8 on 23 Jun 2017. And case no.12 is most likely the 29-year-old male reported from Riyadh on the MOH report, whereas the above report has him from Hail in Hail Region.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>.]
