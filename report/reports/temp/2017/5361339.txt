TheJournal.ie, AFP report [edited]<http://www.thejournal.ie/madagascar-plague-death-toll-climbs-to-30-3630275-Oct2017/>An outbreak of highly contagious plague has claimed 30 lives in the impoverished Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar over the last 2 months. ""We have recorded 194 suspected cases of plague, including 30 deaths,"" health official Manitra Rakotoarivony said in a statement, updating the death toll from 25. Madagascar has a history of plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often sparked by rats fleeing forest fires.The current outbreak is unusual as it has affected urban areas, increasing the risk of transmission, said the WHO. The government has banned public gatherings in the capital Antananarivo in a bid to slow the disease's spread. The outbreak has caused widespread panic, with long queues forming outside pharmacies to buy masks.Trying to reassure Madagascans, WHO official Charlotte Ndiaye said: ""It is as if the plague is the end of the world... but it is a disease like any other. We are lucky that treatment is available for this disease and it is free.""The outbreak combines bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread from person to person. Pneumonic plague can kill quickly, within 18-24 hours of infection if left untreated, but it can be cured by early use of antimicrobials.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is early in the plague ""season"" in Madagascar. The number of cases of pneumonic plague and the presence of _Yersinia pestis_ in nonendemic areas is of concern.Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.The following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998;4(1):101-4, PMID: 9452403; available at <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm>).""Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.""Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the ""black plague"" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997;337(10):677-80, PMID: 9278464; available at <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004>). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181>.]
