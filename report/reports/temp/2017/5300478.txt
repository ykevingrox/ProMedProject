During May-July 2017 at least 848 patients infected with _S._ Enteritidis were reported, compared with 294 cases in the same period in 2016 (2.9-fold increase). During this period _S._ Enteritidis accounted for 58 percent of salmonellosis cases in Israel which marks a major increase in this serovar. Salmonellosis cases were reported nationwide, with case clusters reported mainly from the Jerusalem and the Southern districts. About 2 percent of cases involved invasive infection [see comment below].Several outbreak clusters were reported and investigated during this period in kindergartens, hostels, and restaurants across the country. Epidemiology, trace back, and laboratory data have linked several of the outbreak clusters to eggs with hen farms and egg distributors identified as possible sources. PFGE [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis] analysis of isolates from most reported clusters revealed a shared pulsotype. Further analysis by whole genome sequencing and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) [whole genome multi locus sequence typing] identified several sub-clones. Of particular interest is the identification of a clone from geographically distinct salmonellosis clusters that were temporally linked with a common egg distributor (""Yesh Maof""). This clone has also been detected in the context of a kindergarten outbreak in Southern Israel in 2016. Notably, several disease clusters are associated with _S._ Enteritidis strains belonging to the same pulsotype but accounting for distantly related WGS-types [whole-genome-sequencing types]. Laboratory investigation is still ongoing. It is noteworthy that there have not been any reports of _S._ Enteritidis in any foodstuffs routinely inspected for _Salmonella_ in Israel during the respective period.An outbreak control team has been set up by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture. Joint trace back and trace forward investigations are being carried out in order to identify the source of infection. The Ministry of Agriculture has recently inaugurated a monitoring program for _S._ Enteritidis control in laying hen farms. In the context of this investigation, enhanced environmental sampling of traced laying hen flocks and farms is being carried out. These activities have led to the detection of _S._ Enteritidis in flocks supplying the above-mentioned distributor and a subsequent egg recall and planned culling of implicated flocks. Additional public health actions include continued risk management and source control in farms or flocks that will be implicated in human infection and/or found to be contaminated, enhanced epidemiological investigations for salmonellosis cases or case clusters of gastrointestinal infection, intensified inspections by the National Food Service and risk communication to the public, with emphasis on the safe handling and consumption of eggs and egg-containing foods.[Author: Israel Ministry of Health, Salmonellosis Outbreak Control Team, Jerusalem]--Dr Assaf Rokney,Head of National Reference LaboratoriesCentral LaboratoriesMinistry of HealthJerusalem 91342Israel<assaf.rokney@moh.gov.il>[We are grateful to Dr Assaf Rokney and his colleagues in Israel's Ministry of Health for the above firsthand, authoritative, detailed response to ProMED-mail's request for information addressing the recent salmonellosis event. The collaborative handling of the issue by both ministries -- Health and Agriculture (Veterinary Services) -- demonstrates an exemplary One Health attitude.""Invasive infections"" (also referred to as ""nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ (NTS) infections""), have been observed, according to the report above, in 2 percent of the 2017 cases. NTS infections may cause severe disease such as bacteremia and meningitis.Information on fatalities or their absence has not been included.The event highlights the need to improve the traceability of table-eggs in Israel. Each of the licensed layer farms (nearly 1900, countrywide) has an identification code. Though some of the packing centres include the producers' code numbers in their egg stamps, this is not (yet) required by law. The majority of marketed eggs are currently traceable only to the packing centre, not to the producer.According to the legislation of the EC and most industrialized countries, marketed table eggs should be identifiable (and traceable) to the producer's level. The following example is derived from Commission Regulation (EC) No 589/2008 of 23 June 2008: ""Eggs delivered from a production site to a collector or a packing centre shall be marked with the producer code before leaving the production site."" - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.][See Also:Salmonellosis - Israel (02): eggs, st Enteritidis susp, recall, RFI 20170905.5296449Salmonellosis - Israel: human susp, RFI, poultry, eggs 20170505.5015945].................................................arn/mj/mpp"
