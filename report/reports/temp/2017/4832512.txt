If left untreated, the infection may be life-threatening, and could lead to brain damage, kidney failure, internal bleeding and loss of lung function.The tests were negative for respiratory viruses and _Legionella_, he said.""The incubation period for leptospirosis is 7 to 14 days, which means the patients might have contracted the leptospirosis before going to Kajang. We are investigating the source of contamination such as water and other sources,"" he said. Dr Noor Hisham said that tests are still ongoing to see if there are other infections as well.As of noon [Fri 10 Feb 2017], 12 from the family had symptoms of respiratory infection with one death, 6 in stable condition in hospital, while 5 others received outpatient treatment.No further cases of infection have been detected.""As such, the respiratory tract infection cluster is isolated,"" he said.On [Thu 9 Feb 2017], it was reported that 40 people were quarantined at the Tanah Merah Hospital after a man died of a suspected viral infection after a family gathering in Kajang.[Byline: Loh Foon Fong]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Sat 11 Feb 2017 2:32 PM MYTSource: New Straits Times [edited]<http://www1.nst.com.my/news/2017/02/211367/leptospirosis-outbreak-infection-traced-kelantan-not-kajang>The 3 people who were hospitalised with a mysterious respiratory tract infection -- which has since been identified as leptospirosis -- are believed to have contracted the disease in Kelantan, and not at their family gathering in Kajang, Selangor. Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam told a press conference -- after launching the Pesta Ponggal Muafakat Johor celebrations at Hutan Bandar Mutiara Rini today [Johor, 11 Feb 2017] -- that tests are still being carried out on the remaining patients.Dr Subramaniam said the ministry has not ruled out the recent floods in Kelantan as the source of the leptospirosis, as flood waters could have dislodged the bacterium -- which resides deep in red earth -- and brought it into the open. ""We are testing blood and urine samples of the patients, as well as (soil) samples (near the patients' homes),"" he said, adding that leptospirosis cases emerge from time to time. He urged the public to practice good personal hygiene at all times, and to be alert to bouts of coughing, which is a symptom of the disease.A 59-year-old man in Tanah Merah, Kelantan, is the only confirmed case of the infection so far. The infection, which resulted in the death of the man on [5 Feb 2017], was part of an isolated respiratory tract infection cluster.[Byline: Chuah Bee Kim]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Fri 10 Feb 2017Source The Independent [edited]<http://www.theindependent.sg/super-bug-behind-pneumonia-death-in-malaysia/>Several news reports in Malaysian newspapers and online portals points to the possible existence of super bug _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in the country. Kelantan health director Datuk Dr Ahmad Razin Ahmad Mahir said _K. pneumoniae_ bacteria was suspected to be the possible cause of death.A string of infections, with one death, one patient in critical condition and 40 others from the same family quarantined at the Tanah Merah hospital, in Kelantan, has raised serious concerns among the local medical fraternity.The death and infection occurred on [Mon 6 Feb 2017], at a family gathering that left a government agency officer dead from the suspected pneumonia.The Star newspaper reported that Dr Ahmad Razin said 36 others had been told to limit their movements as a precautionary measure.They were all in Kajang [Selangor] for a Chinese New Year [28 Jan 2017] family reunion about 2 weeks ago before the 59-year-old man, who was a worker with the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (Risda), fell sick.Dr Ahmad Razin said initial investigations showed that the man died from suspected severe pneumonia._Klebsiella_ bacteria are spread through the air and is found in the mouth, skin, and intestines. It can cause pneumonia if inhaled, as well as blood infections via open wounds and meningitis in patients with weakened immunity systems. Early signs and symptoms include high fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, cough with yellow or bloody mucus and shortness of breath.He said the case was not an epidemic.On 13 Jan 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States issued a report on the case of a 70-year-old Nevada woman who died in September 2016 after developing a bacterial infection that was resistant to 26 different antibiotics. The report said the Washoe County Health District in Reno, Nevada, was notified of a patient at an acute care hospital with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) that was resistant to all available antimicrobial drugs. The specific CRE, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, was isolated from a wound specimen which was collected in August, 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the United States indicated that the isolate was resistant to 26 antibiotics, including all aminoglycosides and polymyxins tested, and intermediately resistant to tigecycline (a tetracycline derivative developed in response to emerging antibiotic resistance).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] EpiCore response[The following response was received from EpiCore Surveillance Project member who wishes to remain anonymous, in response to our request for information in ProMED-mail post: Undiagnosed respiratory disease - Malaysia: (KN) RFI 20170211.4830520]Date: Sat 11 Feb 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]A total of 3 family members were hospitalised and 40 quarantined following a mysterious respiratory illness in Kelantan, Malaysia. The 59-year-old, who died, tested positive for leptospirosis. Testing of the other hospitalised family members is ongoing. According to the Ministry, recent floods in Kelantan are likely to have caused the bacteria to be dislodged from the soil and led to infecting the family members. There is no indication of spread within the community at present and the Government is testing the soil near the patients' homes.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail thanks the EpiCore member for the response to our request for information on the recently reported cases of undiagnosed respiratory disease; information also reported in the news report at [1], 3 cases have been hospitalized and confirmed as leptospirosis. - Mod.UBA]A gathering for a Chinese New Year family reunion was held in Kajang, a city in the Malaysian state of Selangor on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia on the Strait of Malacca. The patients are said to be from Kelantan, a Malaysian state located in the northeast of Peninsular Malaysia on the border with Thailand, more than 300 miles (483 km) from Kajang.3 family members, who were initially thought to have ""a mysterious respiratory tract infection"", were subsequently diagnosed with leptospirosis. The laboratory test used to make the diagnosis is not specified in the news reports. The authorities, however, believe that leptospirosis was acquired in Kelantan where there was said to be recent flooding.The 3 family members diagnosed with leptospirosis were hospitalized in 3 different hospitals: one is Tanah Merah Hospital, located in the town of Tanah Merah and another is at Raja Perempuan Zainab II Hospital, located in the city of Kota Bharu, both in Kelantan state; the 3rd hospital is Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Klang Hospital, located in the city of Klang in the state of Selangor.A group of about 40 family members, possibly belonging to the same family as the 3 diagnosed with leptospirosis, are also from Kelantan and were also at a family gathering in Kajang; one (a 59-year-old man) of the 40 family members died from suspected severe pneumonia said to be due to _Klebsiella pneumonia_, another in the group is in critical condition, and 36 others from the same family are said to be quarantined at the Tanah Merah Hospital, in Kelantan. The EpiCore responder above says that the 59-year-old man who died tested positive for leptospirosis.Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall and ensuing fresh water flooding, as is said to have occurred recently in Kelantan. Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. After exposure to floodwater contaminated by leptospira-infected animal, usually rat, urine, the bacteria can enter the human body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Person to person transmission is rare (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2428802/>).Leptospirosis initially presents as a non-specific illness with chills, fever, headache, myalgias, and conjunctival suffusion. Patients often have a dry cough, which is usually mild and without any sequelae, that accompanies the other symptoms. Severe leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterized by liver damage (causing jaundice), renal failure, and bleeding. Meningoencephalitis and myocarditis may also be present. However, pulmonary involvement, which manifests itself as pulmonary hemorrhage, can be severe, with massive hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency and death (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519021/>). Leptospirosis-associated severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome has been increasingly reported worldwide and is associated with case fatality rates greater than 50 percent (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16148523&dopt=Abstract> and <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/14/3/07-1064_article>)Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The leptospira Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/>). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.More information on the outbreak that has involved patients in Selangor and Kelantan, Malaysia would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources: 1) on the clinical presentation of all the cases;2) if the 3 patients with laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis, who were initially thought to have a pulmonary infection, belong to the same family group that included the one patient who died of severe pneumonia and now is diagnosed with leptospirosis; and3) the type of laboratory testing used to confirm the diagnosis of leptospirosis. - Mod.MLMaps of Malaysia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Malaysian.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12941>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
