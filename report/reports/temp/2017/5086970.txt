ABC13, KTRK [edited]<http://abc13.com/health/texas-man-dies-after-swimming-with-new-tattoo/2063940/>An unidentified Texas man died after he went swimming in the Gulf of Mexico shortly after he got a crucifix tattoo with the words ""Jesus is my life"" below it, according to a case study published last week [27 May 2017] . According to the medical journal, BMJ Case Reports, the unidentified 31-year-old man was in the Gulf of Mexico 5 days after the procedure. That's where he was infected by the bacterium, _Vibrio vulnificus_, which led to his hospitalization.What was especially shocking to the researchers was how quickly the man's condition deteriorated: He went swimming 5 days after he was tattooed, and 24 hours after he was admitted to the hospital, he was on life support. The case report notes that the 31-year-old suffered from chronic liver disease. He developed septic shock and died about 2 months later.While most healthy people do not die as a result of _V. vulnificus_, the authors of the study did say the case report showed how dangerous infection can be for those with liver illnesses, as well as anyone who receives a tattoo. One of the top rules after getting a new tattoo is to avoid swimming and bathing, because it's easy to pick up infections. Even if you don't have chronic liver disease, doctors say it's important to follow safety recommendations after getting new ink.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka[An unusual portal of entry for the bacterium is reported here. There are 2 other points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave.It is likely that this is not a 2017 case since the _V. vulnificus_ season is just starting and the lead time for publication strongly suggests the case is from a past year. ProMED thanks this rapporteur for the posting who also supplied the citation itself below.Hendren N, Sukumar S, Glazer CS: _Vibrio vulnificus_ septic shock due to a contaminated tattoo. BMJ Case Reports 2017; doi:10.1136/bcr-2017-220199 <http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220199.abstract>""We present a case of _Vibrio vulnificus_ septic shock and cellulitis in a patient with chronic liver disease that occurred after obtaining a leg tattoo with subsequent seawater exposure in the Gulf of Mexico. Initial suspicion for _V. vulnificus_ was high and he was started on empiric doxycycline and ceftriaxone at admission. Blood and wound cultures grew oxidase positive and comma-shaped Gram-negative rods ultimately confirmed to be _V. vulnificus_. Despite aggressive initial treatment, the patient developed septic shock and died.This case highlights the association of chronic liver disease and high mortality associated with infections of _V. vulnificus_. Health providers should remain vigilant for _V. vulnificus_ infections in patients with chronic liver disease and raw oyster ingestion or seawater exposure.""- Mod.LL]
