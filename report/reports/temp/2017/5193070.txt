The deadline for submission of proposals is [Fri 6 Oct 2017]. Submission guidelines and procedures are available at: <http://polioeradication.org/tools-and-library/research-innovation/grants-and-collaborations/>. - Animations from WHO on the Polio Surveillance System [<http://polioeradication.org/news-post/the-polio-surveillance-system/>], Reaching Every last Child [<http://polioeradication.org/news-post/every-last-child/>] and Responding to a Polio Outbreak [<http://polioeradication.org/news-post/responding-to-a-polio-outbreak/>] have won the Innovation (Screen) category of the EVCOM Clarion Awards [<http://www.evcom.org.uk/news/our-news/winners-revealed-at-the-evcom-clarion-awards-in-association-with-drp/>], for offering a fresh and unique way of engaging audiences in projects concerning the environment, health, education, social welfare and sustainability. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan - one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case and one new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syria - 4 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolated from AFP cases. See country-specific section below, for more details.Afghanistan - One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 5. It is the most recent case in the country, with onset of paralysis on [19 Jun 2017] from Kandahar. - One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017], from Nangarhar, collected on [Wed 21 Jun 2017]. It is the 7th WPV1-positive environmental sample detected in the country this year [2017]; 3 of the 7 samples are from Nangarhar and 3 from Kandahar. - With most of Afghanistan polio-free, efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen operations, in close coordination with Pakistan, to address remaining low-level transmission in the common reservoir area of the Quetta-Kandahar transmission corridor. - Afghanistan is carrying out a programme review focusing on the implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan and making necessary adjustments for the 2nd half of 2017. - Read the latest polio update from WHO Afghanistan to see information on cases, surveillance, vaccination campaigns for the month of June [2017]. [Available at: <http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/AFG/COPub_AFG_2017_19923_EN.pdf?ua=1>]Pakistan - No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017] ; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 3. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [Sun 11 Jun 2017], from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan. - The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan.Nigeria - No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 August 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016). - The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighbouring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger. - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin - The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak. - Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.Central Africa - No new cases were reported in the past week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017]. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is affected by 2 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), in Haut Lomami province (2 cases, with onset of paralysis on [Wed 8 Mar 2017 and Mon 20 Feb 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [Sun 26 Mar 2017 and Tue 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [Tue 2 May 2017]). - Outbreak response plans are currently being finalised, with supplementary immunization activities using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. - The 1st mOPV2 campaign was implemented end of June ([27-29 June 2017]) targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 years in the 2 affected provinces. - Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries. - DR Congo is also affected by an Ebola outbreak, in Bas Uele province in the north of the country. Coordination among both outbreak response teams will be necessary and teams are already working on this [declared over by WHO on Sun 2 Jul 2017]. - Mod.MPP]Middle East - In Syria, 4 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017], all from Mayadeen district, Deir-Al-Zour governorate. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is now 27. All cases had onset of paralysis between [Fri 3 Mar 2017 and Tue 6 Jun 2017]. 26 of the cases are from Mayadeen, and one case is from Raqua governorate. - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Although access to Deir-Al-Zour is compromised due to insecurity, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, 2 campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using the bivalent oral polio vaccine ([bOPV]). However, only limited coverage was possible through these campaigns. - A total of 2 outbreak response campaigns are planned covering both Deir-Al-Zour and Raqua, the 1st to commence on [Sat 22 Jul 2017] targeting 328 000 children aged less than 5 years in Deir-Al-Zour and 120 000 children in Raqua.Officially reported cVDPV cases as of [Tue 18 Jul 2017]Total global cases in 2017: 31 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016) - Syrian Arab Republic: 27 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 6 Jun 2017 - Democratic Republic of the Congo: 4 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 18 Apr 2017 - Pakistan: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016 - Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016 - Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016 - Total global cases in 2016: 5 - Total in endemic countries: 2 - Total in non-endemic countries: 3--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[New in the above update is the official confirmation of the reported case in Kandahar, Afghanistan (see Poliomyelitis update (19): Afghanistan (KD) 20170716.5179107 for media report), also confirmation of positive environmental sample from Nangarhar, Afghanistan, and confirmation of 4 additional cVDPV2 cases in Deir-al-Zour, Syria. Of note is that in the global update report from the GPEI mentioning a positive environmental sample from Kandahar, Afghanistan less than a week later there was confirmation of a polio case due to infection with WPV1. One can't help but wonder if a similar occurrence will occur now in Nangarhar, having just identified a positive environmental sample.With respect to the outbreak of cVDPV2 in Syria, according to the [Tue 18 Jul 2017] WHO-UNICEF situation update (available at <http://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/syria/WHO_UNICEF_Situation_Report_5_cVDPV2_outbreak_Syria__18.7.2017.pdf?ua=1>there have been a total of 87 AFP cases reported from Deir-Al-Zour and one from Raqqah. Of note is that there were 28 AFP cases reported from Deir-al-Zour in May 2017 with 16 confirmed as due to cVDPV2, in June 2017 there were 20 AFP cases reported with 3 confirmed thus far as due to infection with cVDPV2, and there have been 5 AFP cases reported in July 2017 thus far.Of note are the newly released Haj vaccination requirements: ""Regardless of age and vaccination status, proof of receipt of a dose of oral polio vaccine, or inactivated polio vaccine, within the previous 12 months and at least 4 weeks prior to departure, is required to apply for an entry visa to Saudi Arabia for travelers arriving from countries including Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan.""The polio vaccine is also required of pilgrims from states no longer affected by the infectious disease, but which remain vulnerable to reinfection. These include Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Guinea, Laos, Madagascar, Myanmar, Niger, Ukraine, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.""(see <http://www.arabnews.com/node/1132131/saudi-arabia> for the full discussion).The global map of locations of confirmed WPV1 and cVDPV cases can be found at: <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.HealthMap/ProMED maps of Syria and Pakistan can be found at:Syria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>Pakistan: <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/?p=140>A map showing the detailed locations of the cases reported from Afghanistan can be found at:Afghanistan: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/137>. - Mod.MPP]
