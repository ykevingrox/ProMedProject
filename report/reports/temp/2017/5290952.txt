The Mainichi [edited]<https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170902/p2a/00m/0na/010000c>The genotype of the O157 strain of _E. coli_ found in people with foodborne illness after eating potato salad from deli counters in Gunma and Saitama prefectures is consistent, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has revealed. The same bacterial genotype has also been detected in people as far away as Shiga, Mie and Niigata prefectures.Keen to ascertain the sources of infection as well as the extent to which the O157 strain has spread, the health ministry sent out a notification on [Fri 1 Sep 2017] to local authorities across the country. The notice encourages local authorities to ask people infected with the strain what they have eaten and whether or not they have traveled. This summer, the number of O157 _E. coli_ cases has been higher than in an ordinary year. In response, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases examined the bacterial genotype of the strain in infected people in 144 cases between 14 and 20 Aug 2017, and found that it was consistent in most cases. The health ministry has deemed that food and other items from the same source of contamination are being distributed across a wide area. As a result, it is feared that patients coming into contact with these items are spreading the O157 strain.To tackle the issue, the health ministry has told local authorities across the country to perform a genotype test and to confirm detailed information relating to the use of swimming pools and any contact with animals in patients found to have the same strain as that found in Saitama and Gunma prefectures. In addition, it has asked companies that provide meals to schools to take robust preventative measures against possible infection, especially as children across the country are now returning to class from summer vacation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED would like more information regarding the number of cases related to the particular genotype of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and if potato salad was the reservoir involved.Japan has 47 prefectures. They form the 1st level of jurisdiction and administrative division of Japan. They consist of 43 prefectures proper, 2 urban prefectures (Osaka and Kyoto), one ""circuit"" or ""territory"" (Hokkaido) and one ""metropolis"" (Tokyo). A map of the prefectures can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan#/media/File:Regions_and_Prefectures_of_Japan_2.svg>. The prefectures reported to have cases of the same genotype are Saitama, Gunma, Shiga, Mie and Niigata. Saitama, Niigata and Gunma are adjacent to each other and close to Tokyo. Shiga and Mie are adjacent to each other and close to Kyoto. - Mod.LL]
