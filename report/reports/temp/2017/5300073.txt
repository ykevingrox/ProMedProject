Medical Xpress, The Associated Press (AP) report [edited]<https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-09-brazil-declares-yellow-fever-outbreak.html>Brazil's Health Ministry has declared an end to a yellow fever outbreak that killed more 250 people over the past 9 months.The ministry said [Wed 6 Sep 2017] that the last case of the mosquito-borne disease was in June. In total, 777 people were infected, of whom 261 died.The outbreak was highly unusual in a country that typically sees a handful of cases each year. The disease also occurred in areas not previously considered at risk and where vaccination rates were low.In response, Brazil mounted a massive vaccination campaign, sending out more than 36.7 million doses. Vaccination efforts are continuing since the ministry says the average coverage rate in areas that bore the brunt of the outbreak is around 60 percent, below the target of 95 percent.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>andProMED-mail Rapporteur George Robertson[It is good to learn that the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Brazil has been officially declared over. The good news that emerged during the outbreak is that all the YF cases were reported to have been due to spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission, and not to the urban cycle transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, which could have resulted in a much bigger outbreak in this under-vaccinated population. The occurrence of the YF case in the neighboring country of French Guiana is a reminder that YF virus is endemic in the general area.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.

Global yellow fever vaccination coverage from 1970 to 2016: an adjusted retrospective analysis. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30419-X. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30419-X. [Epub ahead of print]----------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------BackgroundSubstantial outbreaks of yellow fever in Angola and Brazil in the past 2 years, combined with global shortages in vaccine stockpiles, highlight a pressing need to assess present control strategies. The aims of this study were to estimate global yellow fever vaccination coverage from 1970 through to 2016 at high spatial resolution and to calculate the number of individuals still requiring vaccination to reach population coverage thresholds for outbreak prevention.MethodsFor this adjusted retrospective analysis, we compiled data from a range of sources (such as, WHO reports and health-service-provider registries) reporting on yellow fever vaccination activities between 1 May 1939, and 29 Oct 2016. To account for uncertainty in how vaccine campaigns were targeted, we calculated 3 population coverage values to encompass alternative scenarios. We combined these data with demographic information and tracked vaccination coverage through time to estimate the proportion of the population who had ever received a yellow fever vaccine for each 2nd level administrative division across countries at risk of yellow fever virus transmission from 1970 to 2016.FindingsOverall, substantial increases in vaccine coverage have occurred since 1970, but notable gaps still exist in contemporary coverage within yellow fever risk zones. We estimate that between 393 million and 472 million people still require vaccination in areas at risk of yellow fever virus transmission to achieve the 80 percent population coverage threshold recommended by WHO; this represents between 43 percent and 52 percent of the population within yellow fever risk zones, compared with between 66 percent and 76 percent of the population who would have required vaccination in 1970.InterpretationOur results highlight important gaps in yellow fever vaccination coverage, can contribute to improved quantification of outbreak risk, and help to guide planning of future vaccination efforts and emergency stockpiling.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Both reports above point out the adverse consequences of inadequate vaccination coverage. Although it is expensive to track the proportion of the population that is vaccinated over time, and mount ongoing population coverage to reach 80 percent or more, dealing with significant outbreaks such as the ones in Angola and Brazil is much more expensive in terms of finances and human lives. Brazil wisely continues vaccination campaigns to reach this level. One hopes that institutional memories are sufficiently strong to continue coverage over the long-term. - Mod.TY]
