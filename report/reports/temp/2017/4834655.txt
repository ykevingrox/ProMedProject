EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited][The following is a response to an EpiCore RFI for ProMED-PORT post Febre amarela - BolÌ via, caso confirmado, silvestre (?), turista estrangeiro 20170212.4833611 [Yellow fever - Bolivia, confirmed case, sylvatic (?), foreign tourist], issued by Mod.RNA, which raised these questions:- Where and when was the case in Bolivia infected?- Was it transmission in the sylvatic cycle?- When was the onset of symptoms and when [was] the diagnosis?- Why and when was the case transferred to Chile?- What prevention and control actions are being and/or have already been taken?Some of these questions were answered in ProMED-mail post Yellow fever - Americas (19): Bolivia (LP) 20170211.4832508. The response below to the RFI provides more detail about the case. - Mod.TY]On 30 Jan 2017, after the confirmation in Bolivia, of a human case of yellow fever, after 10 years of epidemiological silence, the Bolivian Ministry of Health, started an epidemiological and entomological investigation in order to assess if the case was imported or autochthonous.The case is a Danish tourist who came to Caranavi, in La Paz department (Bolivia), on 9 Jan [2017]. According to the Bolivian media, on 24 Jan [2017] he presented intense fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice and was attended in a local clinic and then moved to Arco Iris Hospital in La Paz, where his condition improved but finally was transferred to a Chilean health center to complete medical evaluation.The National Center of Tropical Diseases (CENETROP) [in Santa Cruz, Bolivia] confirmed the case on 30 Jan [2017].The local health Director (SEDES), Freddy Valle, said that if the tourist went into the forest, it would be a sylvatic yellow fever case, because _Haemagogus_ spp mosquitoes, a vector, are present (1). Sylvatic yellow fever usually is present in the Rupa-Rupa region (located at 400 to 1000 meters above sea level [1300-3200 ft]) and coincides with areas dedicated to the production of coffee. [The Rupa-Rupa or high jungle region is one of the 8 natural ecological regions of Peru and Bolivia, located on the eastern foothills of the Andes mountains. This region has narrow and long valleys and fluvial mountain canyons. The weather is warm, humid, and rainy. - Mod.TY]This region has a tropical flora. Caranavi is an agricultural region also dedicated to the coffee production, so it is expected to have the reservoirs and vectors for the sylvatic cycle of yellow fever (2). Epizootics of yellow fever in which primates such as monkeys get sick or die often precede the occurrence of human cases. In the Brazil outbreaks, yellow fever epizootics were confirmed.Several control measures were taken by the ministry of health, such as:1. They have vaccinated all foreigners who were in this region and had not been previously vaccinated against yellow fever.2. All foreigners will be asked to present their yellow fever vaccination certificate before they enter Bolivia.3. The health authority also indicated that in the area of entry to this region, a medical team will work on the vaccination of people who have not been vaccinated yet.4. An epidemiological and entomological investigation is going on.Final comments: Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru have been affected by sylvatic yellow fever since last year [2016] (3). In Brazil an epizootic has been documented, but it is currently unknown in other countries and probably due [to occur]. In Brazil, the state of Minas Gerais is the center of this epidemic. All these affected areas have Rupa-Rupa regions (ecological scenario of sylvatic yellow fever) and also share borders.References----------1.

There was one case in 2013 in Cochabamba department and another one in 2012 in Beni department.The occurrence of a case in the tropical area of La Paz department is not surprising. Yellow fever virus is endemic in the Amazon Basin of the South American tropics. This is undoubtedly a case of sylvan (jungle) yellow fever, where the virus infects wild primates and is transmitted to people by forest mosquitoes.It is critical that individuals visiting or residing in these areas be vaccinated against yellow fever virus infections, to not only protect themselves, but to prevent introduction of the virus into the urban cycle where significant numbers of cases, with a high (30 percent) case fatality may occur, as happened in Paraguay in 2008. It is good that the local health authorities are responding to the occurrence of this case.Maps of Bolivia can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7048>. - Mod.TY]
