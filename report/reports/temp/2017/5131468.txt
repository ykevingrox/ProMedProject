Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hong-kong-reports-necrotizing-fasciitis-case-due-vibrio-91152/>Hong Kong health officials reported a sporadic case of necrotizing fasciitis due to _Vibrio vulnificus_ infection affecting a 49-year-old male with underlying illnesses. He presented with bilateral foot and ankle pain and malaise since [Mon 5 Jun 2017], attended the Accident and Emergency Department of a public hospital on [Tue 6 Jun 2017] and was admitted on the same day. The clinical diagnosis was necrotizing fasciitis.Excisional debridement of left foot was performed. Specimens of blood and left foot fluid collected on [Tue 6 Jun 2017] grew _Vibrio vulnificus_. His current condition is stable.Epidemiological investigation revealed that the patient did not have recent travel history. There was no history of wound or injury. He lived with his wife and mother-in-law, who remained asymptomatic. Investigation is ongoing._Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria. Ingestion of _Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. _Vibrio vulnificus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulcers.Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease. The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people.--Communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[In the absence of a direct water exposure, it is likely that the patient's exposure to _V. vulnificus_ was related to uncooked seafood such as raw oysters. The man apparently had underlying risk factors but they are not stated in the posting.The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.""The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>.]
