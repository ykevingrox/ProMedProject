Times of India [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/kfd-virus-situation-needs-experts-forest-department/articleshow/60065753.cms>Expressing concerns over lack of scientific data about the Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) virus in Goa, the forest department has said that experts should be given the task of analyzing the situation. Pointing out that carcasses of infected monkeys found in Goa's hinterlands have mostly been of the langoor species, officials say that a systematic study with a database of the same is thus required to evaluate this phenomenon.As many as 82 human cases of KFD or monkey fever have been registered in the state from January to June, this year [2017]. The incidence of disease, however, appears less menacing in the face of 3 deaths and 284 cases in 2016; it is slowly spreading to other talukas.In 2015, when the disease was 1st detected in Goa, it was limited to Sattari taluka. The following year, a few cases were detected in Dharbandora, while this year [2017], 5 persons from Pernem taluka were detected with the virus. There are no figures, however, of the source of this disease, i.e. the monkeys. Forest officials, however, stated that of the 2 monkey species in Goa, only one was seen dying of the infection.""There are 2 species of monkeys in Goa: Macacque and the Langoor. We have noticed that the monkey carcasses have only been of the langoor species. However, we require a systematic study with database to review this,"" an official said.Sources in the department urged that a body of experts appointed by the high court is required to provide scientifically-backed data. ""These monkeys are very social animals and move in groups. We cannot identify the disease by sight on a particular monkey, but since their ticks are the main carriers of the disease, we can assume that the entire group can be infected if even one of them has it. There should be continuous observation and analysis over a period of time to arrive at a conclusion,"" they said.---Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to South Asia. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. The symptoms of the disease include a high fever with frontal headaches, followed by haemorrhagic symptoms, such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat, and gums, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding. Other symptoms include vomiting, muscle stiffness, tremors, absent reflexes, and mental disturbances [Dobler, Gerhard (2010). ""Zoonotic tick-borne flaviviruses."" Veterinary Microbiology. 140 (3/4): 221-228. PMID 19765917. doi:10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.08.024].An affected person may recover in 2 weeks, but the convalescent period is typically very long, lasting for several months. There will be muscle aches and weakness during this period, and the affected person is unable to engage in physical activities.Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. The vaccine for KFDV consists of formalin-inactivated KFDV. The vaccine has a 62.4 percent effectiveness rate for individuals who receive 2 doses. For individuals who receive an additional dose, the effectiveness increases to 82.9 percent [Kasabi, Gudadappa; Murhekar, Manoj; Sandhya, Vijay; Raghunandan, Ramappa; Kiran, Shivani; Channabasappa, Gowdra; Mehendale, Sanjay (2013). ""Coverage and Effectiveness of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) Vaccine in Karnataka, South India, 2005-10."" Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases. 7 (1): 1-4]. Specific treatments are not available.Vaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been the primary strategy for controlling KFD. The strategy involves mass vaccination in areas reporting KFD activity (i.e., laboratory evidence of KFD virus [KFDV] in monkeys, humans, or ticks) and in villages within a 5-km radius of such areas [Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, 2005 manual on Kyasanur Forest disease; unpub. data]. Two vaccine doses are administered at least one month apart to persons 7-65 years of age. Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination; thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/1/14-1227_article>. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/301>.]
