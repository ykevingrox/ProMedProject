Yakima (WA) Herald [edited]<https://goo.gl/wzcCpA>The state [Washington] has suspended the milk processing license of Pride and Joy Dairy in Toppenish [Yakima county] following recent testing that confirmed the dairy's organic raw milk was the cause of 2 salmonella illnesses resulting in hospitalization earlier in 2017. ""(Those patients) consumed it, and the strain that we found in the milk matches that strain,"" said Department of Agriculture spokesman Hector Castro, referring to lab test results. ""The milk is what made them sick."" The state is urging consumers to avoid any raw milk products from Pride and Joy with any sell-by date.The department suspended the dairy's milk processing plant license [Fri 6 Oct 2017] due to ""ongoing concerns about pathogens in their retail raw milk product,"" a news release on the department's website says. With the suspension in effect, Pride and Joy cannot legally bottle and sell raw milk on the retail market, though it still has its milk producer license and can ship milk to other processing facilities for pasteurization. Calls to the dairy Friday afternoon seeking comment were not immediately returned. The owner said in an email at 5 pm that no one from the state has contacted them or their attorney.In January 2017, the state Department of Agriculture began investigating Pride and Joy raw milk after 2 people reported becoming sick with salmonellosis. The common factor between the 2 cases was consumption of Pride and Joy milk. However, when the state tested retail raw milk sold by the dairy, inspectors found not _Salmonella_ but _E. coli_, another bacterium that frequently causes foodborne illness. But no _E. coli_ illnesses associated with the milk were reported.Since January 2017, the dairy has consistently disputed the state's findings, citing the lack of _E. coli_ illness and the lack of _Salmonella_ in the milk as proof that there was no connection between Pride and Joy product and the 2 recorded illnesses. On their website, Pride and Joy's owners say they have requested information from the Department of Agriculture about the testing protocols and chain of custody of the milk sample. The Department of Agriculture gave Pride and Joy the all-clear to resume production roughly 2 months after the 1st positive _E. coli_ samples, after working with the dairy to address food safety issues until subsequent testing came back clean.But on [27 Sep 2017], as part of routine testing conducted periodically by the department on all raw milk producers statewide, _Salmonella_ was found in raw milk on site at Pride and Joy's Toppenish facility.""It was just one sample,"" [the owner] said last week [week of 27 Oct 2017]. The milk in question, with a sell-by date of [4 Oct 2017], was already ""pretty much all sold and gone,"" she said, and Pride and Joy declined to do the voluntary recall requested by the state. The state Department of Health also participated in analyzing and testing the milk samples, because of the human illnesses involved.Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] to look at the bacteria's DNA, technicians found that the strain of _Salmonella_ in the September [2017] sample was an exact match with the strain found in the 2 people sickened in January 2017. And those are the only 3 samples of that strain the Department of Health database has on record, said Beth Melius, foodborne and enteric disease epidemiologist. ""It's a rare PFGE for us, and it's a pretty rare serotype, too,"" she said. A serotype is a specific strain of a given bacterium.The serotype in this case, _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Dublin, has appeared in only about 66 cases total in Washington state between 2005 and 2017, Melius said, out of 600 to 1000 cases of salmonella recorded every year. ""I feel very confident that the 2 cases are linked to the raw milk, especially since both cases back then specifically said that they purchased and drank Pride and Joy organic raw milk,"" Melius said. ""They even sent us pictures and everything.""The question now, she said, is whether this strain of _Salmonella_ was hanging around the dairy's facility since January [2017] or if it has reappeared.""We know scientific studies have shown that salmonellae can persist in the environment up to a year,"" Melius said. ""And healthy cattle can be carriers and only periodically shed the pathogen in raw milk. That's the question we're trying to figure out.""""Bottom line,"" she said, ""raw milk is not very safe.""[Byline: Molly Rosbach]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[_Salmonella_ Dublin as a cause of salmonellosis associated with unpasteurized milk brings back memories of my Infectious Diseases fellowship at Stanford in California related to the Alta Dena dairy. The following is part of an article published in 1997 by William Jarvis entitled ""Raw milk can be deadly"" (<https://www.ncahf.org/articles/o-r/rawmilk.html>) which described the episode (the references can be seen at the original URL):""For many years, the state's [California] largest dairy (approximately USD 100 million per year), Alta Dena Dairy, aggressively promoted Certified Raw Milk (CRM) as a health food. The owner, Harold Stueve, was apparently a vitalist (one who believed that unprocessed foods possessed a mystical ""life force""). A Los Angeles Times report revealed his ideology:Stueve . . . was feeding milk samples to 2 young pumpkin plants. One plant was being fed raw milk; the other pasteurized. Stueve was convinced that the experiment would show that the raw milk would produce bigger, fatter pumpkins. ""The Lord gives us everything in its wholeness, and that's the way He meant us to keep it,"" he said [3].The term ""certified"" raw milk has no public health significance -- it is a marketing term owned by the American Associations of Medical Milk Commissions (AAMMC). AAMMC was organized in 1907 to develop uniform standard for the production of ""certified raw milk."" One feature at the time was the elimination of bovine tuberculosis from cow herds. However, by 1941, all the disease had been eliminated from all US herds. Hygienic standards are similar in all modern dairy operations. Unfortunately, cleanliness does not protect consumers from every disease that may be transmitted via unpasteurized milk, and animal testing cannot prevent dangerous _Salmonella_ Dublin from contaminating milk. During the 1980s, Alta Dena was the lone member of the AAMMC, meaning that it ""regulated"" itself. The raw milk production facilities were sold by the Stueve family in the late 1980s, so that all milk sold under the Alta Dena label is pasteurized, but the dairy continued to distribute CRM under the name Stueve's Natural Raw Certified Milk (produced by Stueve Brothers Farms at Chino).Between April 1971 and March 1974, _S._ Dublin was isolated from 79 persons in California, 37 of whom had medical conditions. Their ages ranged from 1 month to 88 years; 59 were hospitalized, 16 died, and 32 infections were traced to Alta Dena CRM. Herd tests found that cattle can have localized infections that will not show up in fecal surveys [4]. _Salmonella_ organisms have been recovered 45 times since 1977 from California produced raw milk -- all from Alta Dena's CRM [5]. In 1981, 46 cases of _S._ Dublin were reported in California; in 1982, 70 cases were reported. 24 percent of patients reported using CRM. In 1983, 123 cases were identified, 44 percent reported using CRM; at least 24 of the 1983 patients had cancer. 80 percent of patients were hospitalized, 26 percent died [6]. Alta Dena CRM was also implicated in the Jalisco cheese tragedy that killed 89 people [7]. Stueve refused to believe the data and claimed they were part of a conspiracy against CRM. The facts suggest that just the opposite was true. Alta Dena had strong political support. Governor Jerry Brown was a CRM user. State Senator William Campbell sponsored several bills exempting Alta Dena from control by the state; 2 such bills passed the legislature but were vetoed by Governor George Deukmejian. Alta Dena also intimidated its critics. It launched a USD 110 million personal lawsuit against the physician who testified on behalf of children for the American Academy of Pediatrics [8].Alta Dena's advertising claimed that CRM was the ""safest, purest, most wholesome milk you can buy"" and distributed ""educational"" materials claiming that pasteurization markedly reduced the nutritional value of milk. Alta Dena refused to put warning labels on CRM. The Berkeley Co-op reported that the warning signs it voluntarily posted were repeatedly torn down by CRM buyers. The AIDS problem in San Francisco eventually caused its city council to require such a label. Political intervention in Sacramento continued to prevent the Department of Health Services from ordering Alta Dena to pasteurize. A public interest lawsuit brought by Consumer's Union, the American Public Health Association, and the California Grey Panthers (a senior citizen consumer group) resulted in a 1985 court order requiring a warning label on CRM. Stueve continued to deny that CRM was responsible for health problems. Alta Dena financed an independent study by the UCLA School of Public Health to determine if CRM was actually a problem. Epidemiologists at UCLA estimated that more than one third of reported _S._ Dublin infections in California from 1980-83 were attributable to raw milk consumption. It appeared that the incidence of infection was 8 to 35 per 100 000 [9]. It was determined that the relative risk of illness from _S._ Dublin for CRM users in 1983 was 158.0 based upon an estimated one pint/day/user consuming some of the 12 000 gallons produced daily [10]. - Mod.LLA useful review on salmonellosis in cattle can be found at: <https://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/dms/fapm/fapmtools/7health/Salmorev.pdf>. - Mod.JHA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6287>.]
