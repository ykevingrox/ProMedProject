Public Health Agency of Canada [edited]<http://finance.yahoo.com/news/public-health-notice-outbreak-e-172100021.html>The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with federal and provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_, called _E. coli_ O121. The source of the outbreak has not been identified, and the investigation is ongoing. The risk to Canadians is low. However, Canadians are reminded to follow safe food handling practices to avoid illness._E. coli_ are bacteria that live naturally in the intestines of cattle, poultry and other animals. Most _E. coli_ are harmless to humans. However, there are many different strains of _E.coli_, and some varieties can cause serious illness. While most people made ill by _E. coli_ experience a few days of upset stomach and then recover fully, infections can sometimes be life threatening.Investigation summary---------------------There have been 12 cases of _E. coli_ O121 with a matching genetic fingerprint reported in 3 provinces: British Columbia (4), Saskatchewan (4), and Newfoundland and Labrador (4). The illness onset dates range from November to December 2016. A total of 4 individuals have been hospitalized. These individuals have recovered or are recovering. The investigation into the source of the outbreak is ongoing.Two of the commonest ways to come into contact with _E. coli_ such as this one are by improperly handling raw ground meat, and by eating ground meat that is undercooked. Common sources of _E.coli_ may also be: contaminated raw fruits and vegetables; untreated water; unpasteurized milk and raw milk products; and unpasteurized apple juice or cider.What the Government of Canada is doing--------------------------------------The Government of Canada is committed to food safety. The Public Health Agency of Canada leads multi-jurisdictional human health investigations of outbreaks and is in regular contact with its federal and provincial partners to monitor and take collaborative steps to address outbreaks. Health Canada provides food-related health risk assessments to determine if the presence of a certain substance or microorganism poses a health risk to consumers.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) conducts food safety investigations into the possible food source of an outbreak. The Government of Canada will continue to update Canadians if new information related to this investigation becomes available.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) serotype is identified as O121, one of the non-O157 EHEC serotypes. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21, and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5).References----------1.
