Quite an active start to the new year. Of note is that 4 of the 7 newly confirmed cases were from Buraidah, all classified as primary cases, all with high risk exposure histories currently under investigation. A natural question to ask is what is going on in Buraidah? Is there ongoing transmission in the healthcare environment that has not been identified (perhaps in outpatient clinics, as the 2 newly reported fatal cases from Buraidah both did have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities)? Or is there undocumented person-to-person transmission ongoing in the community that is increasing? Information on results of epidemiologic investigations surrounding these cases would be greatly appreciated.In the past 2 months (since 1 Nov 2016, there have been 58 newly confirmed cases reported. Of these 58 cases, 35 (60 percent), were classified as primary cases with high risk exposure histories currently under investigation; 18 (31 percent) were classified as primary cases with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, 2 (3 percent) were classified as secondary healthcare associated cases in healthcare workers (both were asymptomatic and identified through contact tracing) and 3 (5 percent) were classified as secondary cases in household contacts (2 of whom were asymptomatic and identified through contact tracing).The other 3 newly confirmed cases this year (2017) include 2 from Riyadh (one of whom is an asymptomatic household contact identified through contact tracing) and one person from Madinah with a history of direct contact with camels.Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the location of confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities can be found at the URL given with each MOH report.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPP]
