The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN) [edited]<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/encephalitis-malaria-in-gaya/articleshow/59567876.cms>With at least 8 suspected and one confirmed case of Japanese encephalitis (JE), Gaya district's health delivery system has again been put to test.According to Anugrah Narain Memorial Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) superintendent SK Sinha, microbiology report has confirmed one JE positive case, admitted to the hospital.""Another 7 suspected cases of encephalitis have been reported in the ANMMCH; 3 of the suspected cases are attributed to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unknown variety. Treatment and investigation facilities are available in the hospital,"" Dr Sinha claimed and added samples were being sent to a Patna lab for further confirmation and detailed analysis.According to official records, though AES and JE cases are being almost regularly reported since 2005, the timing has registered a change during the last 2 years. Earlier, it used to hit the pig-rearing section of the population in the closing stages of the monsoon. Pigs are identified as the main carrier of the encephalitis virus. In 2016 and this year too, the outbreak has been somewhat early.According to activist SB Bhaskar, recurrence of encephalitis, despite claims of 2 rounds of total immunisation, has put a question mark over the immunisation exercise.Gaya DM [District Magistrate] Kumar Ravi told TOI an active search has been launched to identify AES/JE cases at an early stage and an awareness campaign initiated. ""The patients generally come to the medical college for treatment at an advanced stage,"" said the DM.Fogging was also being done. Besides the health workers, village-level public representatives were being made aware of the encephalitis treatment protocol, said Ravi.[Byline: Abdul Qadir]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[With one confirmed JE case and 3 suspected AES cases, the status of the remaining 4 cases is not mentioned. Bihar state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus and cases occur there every year. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in northeastern India, not all cases are due to JE virus and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.Although avoidance of mosquito bites is prudent, vector control is difficult so vaccination is the best protective measure. No mention is made of the details of vaccination campaigns in the above report or if the one confirmed case had been vaccinated. The virus has birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12255>. - Mod.TY]
