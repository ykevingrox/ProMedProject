KCBD [edited]<http://www.kcbd.com/story/34548034/possible-hantavirus-case-in-hockley-county>We are looking into reports of a possible hantavirus [infection] case in Hockley County [Texas]. 2 sources tell KCBD that Family Dollar [discount store] has been closed due to the hantavirus.We spoke with an employee who says she tested positive for the virus, and photos were taken at the store today [20 Feb 2017] of signs posted on the door saying the business is closed until further notice.KCBD reached out to Family Dollar Spokesperson Randy Guiler who said it voluntarily closed its store in Levelland on [8 Feb 2017] as a precaution after suspicion of pest infestation in the building's ceiling. Guilder said Family Dollar immediately alerted city health inspectors who cleared the store to reopen on [11 Feb 2017].Since that time, 3 store employees have reported having flu-like symptoms, and while initial tests results indicate the employees' health was not impacted by the infestation, the State Health Department is currently confirming those results.The State Health Department is also conducting a more thorough review of the store to confirm it is safe for employees and customers.KCBD has learned from the office of one of our elected lawmakers that the State Health Services Department has confirmed that it is aware of the hantavirus [infection] reports at Family Dollar and it is now forwarding samples to its disease control labs for testing and confirmation of those positive test results for [a] hantavirus.The state is taking this additional step because some labs have produced false positives when testing for hantaviruses.Guilder said the store will remain closed until the investigation is complete.Guilder said Family Dollar is committed to working closely with state and local authorities to ensure this issue is resolved.We've called the Hockley County Health Department but have not been able to get in touch with anyone there. Covenant Health Levelland tells us they cannot confirm if anyone is being treated with the virus due to HIPPA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996].Bruce White with Covenant Health Levelland said the hospital works closely with officials from the Texas Department of State Health Services and reports any community health issues that arise.We called the Texas Department of State Health Services, and spokesman Chris Van Deusen tells us they do not talk about suspected cases of hantavirus [infections]...only confirmed. He said it is required for suspected cases of hantavirus [infections] to be reported immediately.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hantaviruses [can cause] an infection that can become fatal.People become infected through contact with hantavirus-infected rodents or their urine and droppings.The types of hantaviruses in the United States cannot be transmitted from one person to another.Early symptoms may include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups-thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulder. These symptoms are universal. There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. [More serious cases may evolve to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome with a case fatality rate of 30 percent or higher. - Mod.TY]Diagnosis may be difficult in the early symptoms as they are often confused with influenza.If an individual has been exposed to rodents and experiences these symptoms, please visit your health care provider.Since 1993, Van Deusen said there have been nearly 23 cases of hantavirus [infections] reported on the South Plains.[Byline: Shaley Sanders]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The suspected hantavirus involved in the report above is not stated. If a hantavirus infection is confirmed, Sin Nombre virus is very likely involved. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including West Texas. Deer mice commonly move into dwellings with the onset of cold weather. Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus and shed it in feces, urine, and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at <http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg>.A map showing the location of Texas in the USA can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58299> and a map showing the location of Hockley county in northwestern Texas at <http://geology.com/county-map/texas.shtml>. - Mod.TY]
