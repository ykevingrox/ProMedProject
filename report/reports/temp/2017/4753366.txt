Auburn Reporter [edited]<http://www.auburn-reporter.com/news/mumps-outbreak-in-auburn-area-reaches-87/>The number of mumps cases in King County [Washington] has increased to 120, of them 92 in Auburn, according to Public Health Seattle & King County.Of those cases, 41 have been confirmed, 79 are probable.As of [Wed 4 Jan 2017], 78 mumps cases have been found in children age 17 and younger. 69 percent of the cases reportedly were up to date with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination.Known cities of residence with cases of the mumps include 9 in Kent, 5 in Federal Way, 3 in Pacific and Seattle, 2 in Covington and Des Moines, and 1 each in Algona, Renton, Bellevue, and Black Diamond.Highline Public Schools, Federal Way Public Schools, Kent School District, and Seattle Public Schools each have one case; the remaining cases in school-aged children are in the Auburn School District [ASD].ASD notified families that children won't be allowed to return to school until they have at least one dose of the MMR vaccination. Without proof of that, the district will not allow children to return to school for at least 25 days after the last mumps case in ASD is resolved.The health department advises that there may be cases unrecognized in other schools in the county, as well as in the community in general, and all families need to take precautions:- please do not have your child attend school when sick with mumps symptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen cheeks or jaw);- see a health care provider if those symptoms develop; and- be up-to-date on MMR vaccine.""We strive to provide timely and accurate information to our families,"" the school district said. ""Please be aware our schools are taking universal precautions to support your child's healthy classrooms. We will continue to keep you informed as Public Health -- Seattle & King County continues to keep us updated. Thank you for supporting our school community.""If families have any questions or concerns about a child's health, they are urged to contact their health care providers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Washington (Spokane County)Date: Sun 8 Jan 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/spokane-host-vaccine-clinic-wednesday-10-mumps-cases-confirmed-42597/>The number of mumps cases reported in the Washington state outbreak has risen to 147 as of [Thu 5 Jan 2017], and the total cases reported in Spokane County has reached 10.This has prompted the Spokane Regional Health District to host a free vaccination clinic on [11 Jan 2017]. Free measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines will be available for all ages 11 Jan from 3-7 p.m. at the Salvation Army Community Center, 223 E. Nora Ave. The clinic is sponsored by Walgreens and the Salvation Army.Other vaccines, including flu shots and the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine will be available for free.Of the 10 confirmed mumps cases in Spokane County, at least 5 were fully vaccinated, while the vaccination status of the remainder are unknown.Mumps is an acute infectious viral disease that can cause swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands in the cheeks and jaw.The virus is spread from person to person by coughing and sneezing and by direct contact with saliva and discharges from the nose and throat of infected individuals. Mumps is contagious 3 days prior to and 4 days after the onset of symptoms.Symptoms of mumps usually appear after 14-18 days of infection. They usually include fever, headache, and swelling and tenderness of one or more of the salivary glands, usually the parotid gland (located just below the front of the ear at the angle of the jaw). In mild cases the swelling may only last for 3 days to 4 days, but it may go on even up to a week or more. Approximately one-third of infected people do not exhibit symptoms. There is no specific treatment for mumps.Most complications that may arise involve other organs. Mumps can cause pain and swelling of the testicles, deafness and arthritis. It can cause central nervous system disorders such as encephalitis and meningitis.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Mumps can be prevented with MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>The state of Washington can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248>.

According to Tom Steele, breaking news producer at the Dallas News, the number of mumps cases in North Texas has surpassed 50 as an outbreak in Johnson County has grown and cases have been found in Dallas, Collin, Denton, and Tarrant counties.Most of the cases there are school-age children from Cleburne and Keene [in Johnson County]. Health officials have traced the virus to an outbreak in Arkansas, where several children from Keene had visited recently.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, mumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. In 2010, there were 2612 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229.Before the United States mumps vaccination program began in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.As of 3 Dec 2016, 46 states and the District of Columbia in the United States reported mumps infections in 4258 people to CDC. 7 states have reported more than 100 cases this year [2016]: Arkansas, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Maine, New York, and Oklahoma.A report from the CDC states that the MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66 to 95 percent) effective.The MMR vaccine protects against currently circulating mumps strains.Outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated United States communities, particularly in close-contact settings. In recent years, outbreaks have occurred in schools, colleges, and camps.[Byline: Carly Scott]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34810>. A county map can be seen at <http://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJMumps is caused by a virus from the genus _Rubulavirus_. As stated above, its symptoms include low-grade fever, respiratory problems, and most notably swelling of the parotid glands below the ear, known as parotitis. Although parotitis is the most easily recognized symptom of mumps, it occurs only in about 30-40 percent of cases. Other patients may have non-specific symptoms. Up to 20 percent of infected individuals may experience no symptoms at all. Symptoms typically occur 2-3 weeks after exposure to the virus.The virus is spread by respiratory droplets. These can become airborne when an infected person coughs, sneezes, and talks. Additionally, a person can contract the virus by touching surfaces that are contaminated with infected droplets. Infected individuals are considered most contagious during a period starting several days before the appearance of parotitis (if it occurs), and running through the 5th day after it first appears. To keep a patient from spreading the virus to others, isolation is recommended for 5 days after parotitis begins.In the United States, cases of mumps have dropped by 99 percent since the introduction of a vaccine in 1967, however, mumps has not yet been eliminated in the country. Recent large outbreaks have occurred among college students (2006, more than 6500 cases) and in a tradition-observant Jewish community, sparked by a boy who returned from a trip to the United Kingdom and began showing mumps symptoms while at a summer camp (2009-2010, more than 3400 cases).Mumps cases typically peak in late winter or early spring.Mumps can be a mild disease, but complications may occur. These include meningitis; testicular inflammation in males who have reached puberty, among whom about half experience some degree of testicular atrophy; inflammation of the ovaries or breasts in females who have reached puberty; and permanent deafness in one or both ears. Before the development of a mumps vaccine, the disease was one of the major causes of deafness in children.The live, attenuated mumps vaccine used today in the United States was licensed in 1967. Even though mumps cases occur even in fully vaccinated children and adults, the occurrence of the more severe complications is relatively rare now, evidence of some protection afforded by the vaccine . The MMR vaccine was licensed in 1971. The rubella component of the vaccine was changed in 1979, but the mumps and measles components have remained the same since 1971.(Excerpted and edited from <http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/mumps>)It may be informative to evaluate whether the current mumps vaccine strain is still fully effective against circulating mumps strains, although it is thought to be. As of 26 Nov 2016, there have been 3800 reports of mumps from 45 states and DC. 94 percent of the children and 45 percent of adults have been up to date on vaccination. Arkansas reported more than 1750 cases of mumps, compared with 7 cases in 2015 and 1 in 2014 (CDC). But large outbreaks have been observed previously as noted, in 2006 and 2009-10.At times, a 3rd dose has been given during outbreaks. While there are conflicting results, when administered early in the outbreak, this additional dose appears to be effective. - Mod.LK]
