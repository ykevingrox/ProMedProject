""A lot of STDs don't have or may not present symptoms, so it is really important for us to spread awareness to our students on the importance of getting tested and getting tested regularly,"" Crooks said. A dramatic increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in recent years could be due to a number of factors ranging from inadequate screening to a lack of education, experts say.Syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are the top 3 STDs on the rise, said Christopher Ried, medical director of STD/HIV for the Orange County [OC] Health Care Agency. The 2015-2016 benchmarking STI [sexually transmitted infection] tests and results from students who got tested on campus showed that the numbers rose slightly for each disease from 2015 to 2016. In 2015, 102 out of 2020 CSUF students tested positive for chlamydia, 13 out of 2020 students tested positive for gonorrhea and 5 students out of 1510 students tested positive for syphilis, said CSUF Chief Staff Physician Richard Boucher.In 2016, 165 out of 2161 students tested positive for chlamydia, 26 out of 2161 students tested positive for gonorrhea, and 7 out of 1498 students tested positive for syphilis, Boucher said.A student should get tested once a year or in between partners, Crooks said. For students with several partners in a short period of time, she recommended getting tested every 3 to 6 months.The Health Education Department at CSUF is able to offer individual counseling for students. ""If a student has questions about STIs, they can actually meet with a health educator to learn more about them,"" Crooks said. ""We talk to students about birth control and preventing pregnancy, and we also can talk to a student who has been newly diagnosed with an STI, just so they know what to expect for the future.""Joseph Nassir, MD, a physician who specializes in the treatment of STDs at the OC STD center in Huntington Beach, said syphilis has been reported more frequently in recent years, prompting him and his team to test more often for syphilis.""Originally, I believe it was related with coming in from Southeast Asia and South America, but now it seems to be very prominent here in the United States,"" Nassir said. ""We have seen more cases be positive (over) the past couple of years than it has been in over 22 years.""In Orange County, the most recent data show a 370 percent increase in syphilis cases from 2012 to 2017, 190 percent increase in gonorrhea and a 31 percent increase in chlamydia, Ried said.Compared to last year [2016], chlamydia is down 7 percent. However, Ried said chlamydia numbers ""are volatile"" and prone to margin of error. Gonorrhea is up 14 percent for 2016 to 2017 and syphilis is up 16 percent for 2016 to 2017.At the OC STD center, Nassir said he and his team try to make their patients more comfortable when getting tested by not requiring patients to give their name. He said people are afraid if they give their name, the general public may find out. ""We try to sort of educate people to come and get tested and if they could not afford it, they could be recommended to go to the Public Health Department and get it done for treatment. If they want to try a doctor's office and they want to meet with a doctor one-on-one and discuss things, we encourage them to come in and talk to us,"" Nassir said. Nassir said he recommended that both partners in a relationship get tested and treated before being sexually active again to help prevent the spread of STDs.[Byline: Darylese Shook]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The US national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases, which reached a historic low in 2000 and 2001, increased almost every year since (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm>). Men account for the most cases of P&S syphilis, with the vast majority of those cases occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM) (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stats.htm>). However, during 2013-2015, the rate increased among women, as well as men. It would be important to know the characteristics of the sexually transmitted disease outbreak on the California State Fullerton campus. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.California State University, Fullerton (also known as Cal State Fullerton) is a public research university located in Fullerton, California. With a total enrollment of about 34 462 undergraduates and approximately 5773 graduate students, Cal State Fullerton has the largest student body out of the 23-campus California State University system (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Fullerton>). Cal State Fullerton is designated both as a Hispanic-serving institution and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander serving institution.The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7131>.
