Classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history in the 14 days preceding onset of illness still under investigation. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the 6 days since the last ProMED-mail update (on Mon 13 Feb 2017), there have been 3 newly confirmed cases, bringing the total number of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by Saudi Arabia to 1556, including 648 (bringing the reported case fatality rate to 41.6 percent). Of note is that since the beginning of 2017 there have been a total of 34 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia. Of these 34 cases reported this year (2017), 4 were initially reported as secondary cases - 1 in a household contact, and 3 healthcare acquired cases 2 in patients (in Buraidah) and 1 in a healthcare worker in Jeddah. The remaining 30 cases were initially classified as primary cases, 16 of whom were still pending further investigation into possible high risk exposures. Of note is that follow-up reports from WHO confirmed that there were 6 healthcare acquired cases in a small cluster in Buraidah - hence, 4 cases were initially classified as primary cases pending further investigation for high risk exposures and were later reclassified as secondary healthcare associated cases. The remaining 14 cases had a history of direct or indirect exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.Defining the additional high risk exposures responsible for more than half of the ""primary"" cases is still pending. What also remains as yet unexplained is why Saudi Arabia and not the surrounding countries where camels are plentiful and human-camel exposure occurs as well.Maps showing the locations of the cases discussed in the above report can be found at the source URLs.
