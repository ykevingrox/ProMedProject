The identification was made on [Wed 31 May 2017]. This is the 1st time the mosquito has been detected in southern Nevada.Staff with the health district will begin conducting extensive surveillance to determine the scope of the aedes mosquito population in the area, while also providing nearby residents with breeding prevention information. If the health district discovers further evidence of breeding activity, they will consider appropriate control measures.According to the SNHD, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is the main type of mosquito that spreads Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and other viruses. The species has also been identified in California and Arizona but mosquitoes in those states have not tested positive for the Zika virus. The mosquitoes identified in Clark County will be sent for Zika testing._Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes can become infected if they bite an infected person while he or she still has the virus in their blood. The mosquito then needs to live long enough to bite someone after the virus has had time to multiply in its system.""We have conducted active surveillance for the aedes mosquito since 2014,"" said Dr Joe Iser, chief health officer of the Southern Nevada Health District. ""Detecting the mosquitoes early on, before there is local transmission of disease, will allow us to put our response plans in place and work with our community to implement preventive measures that eliminate breeding sources and help prevent the potential spread of the Zika virus and other diseases.""The health district reported 22 cases of the Zika virus in Clark County residents in 2016, with 21 cases being travel-related and one case being sexually-transmitted. There has been one travel-related case of Zika in Clark County reported in 2017.To control mosquitoes in the area, residents should: - check their yard weekly for water-filled containers or after every use of sprinklers; - throw away or recycle water-holding containers that are not needed; - if empty containers or large objects, such as boats or old appliances must be stored, they should be covered, turned over, or placed under a roof that does not allow them to fill with water; - clean and scrub bird baths and pet-watering dishes weekly and dump the water from overflow dishes under potted plants and flower pots; - fill tree holes and other cavities in plants with sand or soil; - eliminate areas of standing water around their home, including non-circulating ponds, ""green"" swimming pools, and accumulated sprinkler runoff, which support mosquito breeding; - check for hidden bodies of water such as wells, septic tanks, manholes, clogged drains, etc; - call the health district to report mosquitoes.[byline: Jami Seymore]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The appearance of _Aedes aegypti_ in southern Nevada is not surprising, since it has been found in the adjoining states of Arizona and California. This mosquito is easily moved around and can become established in areas with favorable climate and habitats. Fortunately, screened and air conditioned buildings are barriers to its establishment and abundance. - Mod.TY]******[2] _Aedes albopictus_in ConnecticutDate: Tue 30 May 2017 11:09 amSource: CT Post [edited]<http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Disease-spreading-mosquitoes-on-the-rise-in-11173944.php>An invasive species of mosquito that can potentially transmit viruses like Zika and West Nile is spreading in Connecticut, according to a study by state researchers released last week [week of 21-27 May 2017].A team of researchers from Connecticut's Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven detected an increase in the number of Asian tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_] along the south western coast of Connecticut. Single specimens were also occasionally seen in the less populated central part of the state. Last year [2016], researchers found more than 900 Asian tiger mosquitoes in 24 locations, a sharp increase from 2015 when 220 mosquitoes were collected from 10 sites.These mosquitoes, scientifically known as _Aedes albopictus_, are from East Asia where they're known to breed in jungle trees. They can spread serious diseases like chikungunya, dengue fever, Zika, and the West Nile virus, the researchers said. ""It's an aggressive human biter. It likes to feed on people and breeds in close association with humans,"" said Dr Philip Armstrong, a medical entomologist at CAES and the lead author of the study, published last week [week of 21-27 May 2017] in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [Philip M Armstrong, Theodore G Andreadis, John J Shepard, Michael C Thomas. Northern range expansion of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus): Analysis of mosquito data from Connecticut, USA. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017; 11(5): e0005623. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005623 <http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005623>].Researchers found that Connecticut temperatures are mild enough for the Asian tiger to survive the winter. Eggs and larvae have overwintered in the state, hatching in standing bodies of water around people's homes, Armstrong said. ""We're at the northern limit of the range of where it can survive,"" he said. ""If we continue to have mild winters, which we anticipate with climate change, we expect those populations to expand over time.""Armstrong and his team have been monitoring the mosquitoes for 2 decades in nearly 100 locations around the state. Last year [2016], they found that some of the Connecticut mosquitoes carried 2 deadly viruses, Cache Valley and West Nile, posing a potential risk to humans. Asian tiger mosquitoes are mostly present in locations along the Connecticut shoreline, researchers said. The 1st specimens were found in 2006 in Fairfield County and have reemerged every summer since 2010. ""Because this mosquito will feed aggressively on humans, it clearly warrants further study and monitoring,"" Armstrong said.[byline: Sophia Tewa]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As temperatures warm, _Aedes albopictus_ will likely expand its range in North America. Although an avid human biter, unlike _Aedes aegypti_, it also feeds readily on other species that are not susceptible to Zika, chikungunya and dengue viruses, and except under unusual circumstances is less effective epidemiologically for human-to-human transmission of these viruses than is the _Ae. aegypti_ mosquito.
