CAJ News Africa [edited]<http://cajnewsafrica.com/2017/08/18/hundreds-dead-in-raging-cholera-outbreak/>At least 462 people have died in the conflict-torn Democratic Republic of Congo following a cholera outbreak sweeping through Central and West Africa. The deaths from more than 16 539 cases reported so far in 2017 represent 94 percent of the overall incidence in the regions of Africa. This follows a major epidemic reported mainly in the North Kivu province, which is the epicentre of the conflict between rebel groups and the government.In the region, health delivery services have come to a standstill owing to the conflict. Civilians have been forced to flee their homes, adding to the tens of thousands already living in camps for internally displaced people.Meanwhile, In West Africa, similarly to 2016, several countries report sporadic cases. Terror-ridden Nigeria is also battling a severe outbreak of the water borne disease with 20 deaths recorded from 809 cases in 2017. Liberia, a hotspot for diseases, is also affected with 6 deaths from 129 cases. There have also been outbreaks in Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Cast but no casualties have been reported. Overall, 488 deaths have been reported from 17 548 cases in the affected regions.The United Nations Children's Fund stressed the need for increasing vigilance and implementing preventative measures in the current at-risk seasonal period. ""This highlights the importance of regular information exchange within countries sharing the same epidemiological basin.""[Byline: Jean Kassongo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - TanzaniaDate: Wed 16 Aug 2017Source: WHO [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/united-republic-tanzania/taking-stock-lessons-learnt-cholera-outbreak-response-tanzania>Taking stock of lessons learnt from the Cholera outbreak response in Tanzania-----------------------------------------------------------------------------The United Republic of Tanzania is battling an outbreak of Cholera that has since August 2015 affected 26 046 people and claimed 410 lives. Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's borders is a high priority for WHO. To that end, WHO and partners support a well-coordinated multisectoral response through the National Cholera Task Force which plans, coordinates and support subnational authorities.Indeed, learning requires a continuous assessment of performance, a review of successes and failures and a robust support for improvement. An After Action Review (AAR) is a simple methodology for facilitating this assessment. It provides for a qualitative review of actions taken to respond to an emergency as a means of identifying best practices, gaps and lessons learned. As a component of the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (IHR MEF) and part of the preparedness and response cycle, an AAR seeks to identify what worked well or not and how these practices can be maintained, improved, institutionalized and shared with relevant stakeholders. It is within this context that WHO supported the Ministry of Health to convene a meeting of experts to conduct an After Action Review following the national response to the cholera outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - SudanDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017Source: Radio Dabanga [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-new-deaths-and-infections-across-sudan>Singa Hospital in Sudan's Sennar received 16 new cases of cholera during the 1st half of this week [week of Sun 13 Aug 2017]. A woman has died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9 others were infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta locality in Sudan's Kassala state.Sennar StateA medical source told Radio Dabanga that most of the cases in Sennar came from Um Benin village southeast of the city except for 2 cases from El Dindir and El Souki. From Saturday to Monday [12-14 Aug 2017], 26 cases of cholera arrived from Um Benin village. This led the local health authorities to open a new cholera isolation centre at the village.El Gedaref StateEl Gedaref Hospital in East Sudan recorded 15 cases of cholera on Tuesday and Wednesday [15-16 Aug 2017]. A medical source told Radio Dabanga that the hospital received 9 cases on [Tue 15 Aug 2017], while 6 cases were recorded on [Wed 16Aug 2017]. The medic said that all cases of cholera came from Uktuber, El Tadamon, El Geneina, and Kadugli districts in El Gedaref.Kassala StateA woman has died before she could be transferred to hospital, and 9 others were infected with cholera at El Matateib in North Delta locality in Sudan's Kassala state. Youth activist Mohamed Seyidna told Radio Dabanga that ""the woman died in the village before she could be transferred to the hospital"". He said that the hospitalised cases at Wagar Hospital have risen to 9.He attributed the spread of cholera in the area to water pollution and called on the health authorities to make efforts to sterilize drinking water and raise awareness of the residents.National epidemicThe National Epidemiological Corporation reported in early July 2017 that nearly 24 000 Sudanese have been infected and 940 cholera patients have died since the outbreak of the infectious disease in Blue Nile state in August 2016. The Sudanese authorities however, refuse to call the disease by its name, and instead refer to it as ""Acute Watery Diarrhea"". The National Intelligence and Security Service has repeatedly warned medics and the press in the country not to make mention of cholera.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Cholera - Pakistan (Punjab Province)Date: Wed 16 Aug 2017Source: The News [edited]<https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/223756-Number-of-cholera-cases-continues-to-swell>The number of cases of cholera, a highly contagious and fatal disease is continuously on the rise and there is a threat that spread of the infection may take shape of an epidemic if proper preventive and control measures are not taken well in time. The 1st 2 cases of cholera were tested positive by National Institute of Health Islamabad on [Mon 31 Jul 2017] and another 2 confirmed positive for the infection on [Fri 4 Aug 2017]. All the 4 patients were undergoing treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital [BH] where as many as 4 more suspects of the infection have been admitted for treatment.Data collected by 'The News' on [Mon 14 Aug 2017] reveals that the allied hospitals have sent stool samples of over 10 child patients to NIH for confirmation of cholera in last week [week of Sun 6 Aug 2017].On [Sat 12 Aug 2017], as many as 20 child patients with severe diarrhoea were admitted at the BBH of which 4 were suspected as patients of cholera and their stool samples were sent to NIH for confirmation, said Associate Professor of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].He added the hospital has not received confirmation reports from the NIH because of holidays there from Saturday to Monday. However, we have been keeping the suspects in isolation under strict monitoring, he said.He added that repeated rainfalls in the region and water inundation inside and outside homes in a number of localities particularly in thickly populated areas of the city are causing contamination of water and foodstuff that increases chances of spread of a number of infections among population while children are at greater risk of contracting life-threatening infections including cholera.It is important that the transmission of cholera occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms.It is observed that heavy rainfall causes collection of heavily contaminated water in streets and houses and the waste water flooding out of various nullahs [watercourses] including Nullah Leh in town causes infections including cholera, typhoid, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis A and E, shigellosis and giardiasis.Professor Tariq said the consumption of contaminated water and foodstuff causes cholera, an infection in the small intestine caused by bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Its main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in cases which are not treated in time, he said.Health experts say that to avoid cholera and other infections, one must use boiled water for drinking and should use vegetables after washing with clean water and it must be kept in mind that raw vegetables should not be eaten in the existing weather conditions instead these should be used after cooking.To a query, Professor Tariq said the heavy rainfall and water accumulation may contaminate water at sources and there may be chances of contamination of water at tube wells so individuals must boil water before drinking to avoid cholera and other infections.He added the appearance of cholera is alarming and it is time for people to take extra ordinary preventive measures to safeguard their children and themselves from the disease.In case water is accumulated inside home due to heavy rainfall and flooded out of sewage lines, it must be wiped out immediately and the space should be washed with clean water as soon as possible to avoid infections. Avoiding inundation of contaminated water inside homes is a must to avoid cholera and other infections, said Professor Tariq.[Byline: Muhammad Qasim]--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.""The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are: - Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 percent (95 percent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam; - Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).""In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).""References----------57.
