Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/crimean-congo-hemorrhagic-fever-outbreak-central-uganda-98860/>There has been a Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] outbreak in central Uganda. Eight cases, including 2 deaths have been reported from Nakaseke and Kiboga districts as of 28 Aug 2017.The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, and CDC deployed a multi-disciplinary rapid response team to the 2 districts to conduct outbreak investigation and rapid risk assessment. The epidemiology team is in the field to investigate the source of the outbreak and conduct contact tracing.CCHF is known to be endemic in Uganda, especially in the cattle corridor, which is a strip of land spanning across 18 districts, from the southwest to the northeast of the country. Smaller intermittent outbreaks have been reported in the past. The last outbreak occurred in August 2013, during which 6 cases were reported.The simultaneous occurrence of the current outbreak in 2 neighboring districts may be indicative of a larger burden of the disease than expected. The current drought in some parts of the country could heighten the risk of the disease spreading to other areas as a result of livestock movement in search of pasture and water.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The current report indicates that at least 2 adjacent districts have reported CCHF cases, located mainly in cattle raising areas. It is important to reach out with public health education focusing on several aspects, including use of protective clothing such as long sleeves and trousers. People should be advised to wear light coloured clothes during a visit to the animal market to allow easy detection of ticks, and to regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks, and, if found, removing them safely, and using approved repellents on clothing and skin. Furthermore, studies may be planned to map the distribution of the tick species, particularly in the cattle belt region. - Mod.UBA][A map showing the districts of Uganda can be found at: <http://guidetouganda.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UgandaBig.jpg>.- Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97>.]
