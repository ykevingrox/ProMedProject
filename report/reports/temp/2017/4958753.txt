Vaccines for the patients have been unavailable throughout the province's large cities so far.Meanwhile, hospital officials said that they had contacted the Punjab government for vaccines, which the government says will be available in a few days.The majority of the patients are minors, but the doctors are more concerned about elderly patients who are more vulnerable. A senior doctor said that the virus could spread throughout the country if solid measures were not taken in time.Chickenpox resulting from infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of the most common communicable diseases worldwide. While most cases recover spontaneously with time, some may progress to serious consequences in adults, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. The virus is highly contagious, with an attack rate approaching over 85% after exposure. The vaccine is 70-90% effective. Vaccinated individuals who come down with the disease are generally protected from the most severe symptoms. It is particularly important to vaccinate health care workers, minors, and the elderly to protect those most at risk and prevent spread of infection. - Mod.LKA HealthMap of Pakistan can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.]
