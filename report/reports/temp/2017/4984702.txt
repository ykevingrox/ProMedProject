The Tribune [edited]<http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/japanese-encephalitis-claims-life-in-zirakpur/395173.html>Japanese encephalitis, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, has claimed the life of a 20-year-old labourer at Lohgarh village [of Zirakpur, Mohali (SBS Nagar) district, Punjab]. This is the 1st death caused by the virus in Zirakpur this year [2017].The victim has been identified. His blood samples had tested positive for Japanese encephalitis at the PGI. Dr Gagandeep Singh Grover, State Programme Officer, National Vector-Borne Disease-Control Programme, said the victim, a resident of Bihar, was taken ill on 5 Apr [2017]. He was admitted to JP Hospital, Zirakpur, on [7 Apr 2017] where his condition deteriorated. He was referred to the PGI on [9 Apr 2017]. He died on [11 Apr 2017].Dr Grover said the patient had travelled to Bihar and might have contracted the virus there. He said there was no report of any other patient with symptoms of the influenza in the city.""Since no pigs or rice fields were found in the vicinity of the victim's residence, the possibility of the virus circulating in the area has been ruled out,"" said Dr Grover.The patient was the lone case of Japanese encephalitis in Zirakpur. The man complained of fever after returning from Bihar.""The virus is transmitted to human beings from pigs that act as reservoir of germs [the virus] via the bite of a mosquito called _Culex vishnui_ [and other members of the _vishnui_ complex]. There is no other way of transmission,"" said a senior doctor at the Civil Hospital, Dera Bassi.Sources at the PGI said the victim's blood samples tested positive for the virus. The hospital authorities informed the Health Department as soon as they got the Japanese encephalitis test report of Arshad.The sources said the victim was taken to a private practitioner in Panchkula [Haryana] after he complained of severe headache and nausea.He was referred by the private practitioner to JP Hospital, Zirakpur, from where he was further referred to PGI in a serious condition. The hospital authorities had collected the blood samples and the report became available on [Thu 21 Apr 2017], which confirmed the disease.Dr Jai Singh, Civil Surgeon, Mohali, said teams had been asked to sensitise people to protecting themselves from the virus. "" As soon as we came to know about the death due to the disease, fogging to prevent breeding of mosquitoes was started in the area,"" he said.[Byline: Satinder Pal Singh]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Bihar state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus and cases occur there every year. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in north eastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology. This case, however, is a confirmed JE case.Pigs may certainly serve as amplifying hosts, but the reservoir species are avians, including ardeid birds (such as herons and egrets), which may have been the species responsible for maintenance and movement of the virus in the area. Repeated insecticide spraying can reduce population of _Culex_ mosquitoes, but vaccination of individuals is likely to be the most effective way to prevent JE cases. The JE virus transmission season is just starting now, so this would be an ideal time to begin vaccination campaigns in endemic areas where cases occur annually.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59894>, and a district map of Punjab can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/punjab/punjab-district.htm>. - Mod.TY]
