Given the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in the region, and the clinical similarity of cases of that virus infection and CHIKV infection, one wonders how many cases that were not laboratory confirmed but clinically diagnosed as ZIKV infections were, in reality, CHIKV infections. It is also possible that a significant proportion of the population have been infected by CHIKV in the previous 3 years and are now immune. It seems likely, however, that CHIKV is now endemic in the Americas, and sporadic, small outbreaks may continue to occur as they do in Asia and Africa. - Mod.TY][See Also:Chikungunya (26): Asia (Pakistan) comment, RFI 20170811.5240010Chikungunya (25): Asia (Pakistan) 20170809.5235254Chikungunya (24): Asia (Pakistan) 20170726.5205157Chikungunya (23): Asia (Bangladesh), case numbers 20170711.5165290Chikungunya (22): Americas, Asia 20170704.5149989Chikungunya (21): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170626.5132080Chikungunya (20): Asia (Pakistan) 20170623.5127317Chikungunya (19): Americas, Asia, observations, research 20170610.5096983Chikungunya (06): Americas, Asia, research 20170206.48179592016---Chikungunya (14): Americas, Asia, Pacific, research, observations  20161201.4667167Zika & chikungunya viruses: comparative transmission  20161005.4539231Chikungunya (13): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Africa, Europe  20160818.4426342Chikungunya (12): Americas, Asia  20160730.4380775Chikungunya (11): Americas, Pacific, Asia, Africa  20160702.4323117Chikungunya (10): Americas, Pacific, Asia, Africa  20160614.4285787Chikungunya (09): Americas, Asia  20160427.4186163Chikungunya (08): Americas, Asia  20160330.4128367Chikungunya (07): Americas  20160320.4106646Chikungunya (06): Americas  20160302.4062712Chikungunya (05): Americas  20160223.4044850Chikungunya (04): Americas  20160217.4027484Chikungunya (03): Americas, Asia  20160206.3998786Chikungunya (02): Americas  20160126.3968082Chikungunya (01): Americas, Asia  20160108.3920697].................................................sb/ml/dk/sh/ml/jh/ao/sh"
