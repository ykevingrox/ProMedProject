The tea leaves, bought at Sun Wing Wo Trading Company, contained the plant-based toxin aconite, the Department of Public Health said on Friday [10 Mar 2017].A man in his 50s last month [February 2017] and a woman in her 30s this month [March 2017] became critically ill within an hour of drinking the tea, and both remain hospitalized, health officials said. Each person grew weak then had life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms that required resuscitation and intensive care.Aconite, also known as monkshood, helmet flower and wolfsbane, is used in Asian herbal medicines. But it must be processed properly to be safe.Health officials are working to find the original source of the tea leaves, and they are warning others to stop consuming it. ""Anyone who has purchased tea from this location should not consume it and should throw it away immediately,"" said Dr TomÌÁs AragÌ n, health officer for the city and county of San Francisco. ""Aconite poisoning attacks the heart and can be lethal.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A number of plants, including _Aconitum vulparia_, contain the alkaloid aconitine. Aconitine poisoning may cause death rapidly, generally in under an hour, but occasionally after as long as 2-6 hours. The toxin affects the nerves as well as the heart, so it is both neurotoxic and cardiotoxic. All parts of the plant are toxic.Over 100 different plants contain aconitine and a large number of hybrids also contain the toxin. The investigation will require a good microscopist to identify the correct plant in the tea. Confirmation can likely be done by instrumentation, but if they are looking for the plant specifically, that may be a different issue. It is likely there may be a large batch contaminated with the suspect plant. - Mod.TGThe following review may be of interest to readers: Chan Y. Aconite poisoning.
