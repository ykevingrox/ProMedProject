His blood sample for CCHF serology was sent to National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad on [14 Apr 2017]. He was reported as a positive by NIH. Patient is currently isolated in Department of Infectious Diseases, HFH, Rwp. The patient is now in fulminant hepatic failure and critically ill, with a hemoglobin of 5.2 gm/dl and platelet count of 46 000/cu mm. During the course of illness, his hemoglobin and platelet count had dropped to 7.6 gm/dl and 33 000/cu mm.Moreover, the health care workers who were exposed to this patient have been listed and are under observation. Field preventive and control activities in the Mianwali district have been started, including tick elimination and awareness of the general public. Staff at local hospital where the patient was initially treated are under observation.--Mumtaz A KhanNational Institute of Health Pakistan<drmomi74@hotmail.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Mumtaz Khan for the valuable contribution from Pakistan.Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease prevalent in Asia, Africa, Middle East, and the South-Eastern Europe [1]. The CCHF virus has a fatality rate of 10-50 percent [2]. In Asia, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan are endemic to CCHF. The active areas are those in the border between the 3 countries. The movements of the nomads across the borders with their animals, including those infested with _Hyalomma_ ticks are responsible for transmitting the virus to both the animals and the humans [2]. The peak of disease occurrence is long term from March to October (spring to fall) as ticks are active in this period, although cases are reported throughout the year. The unsanitary state of breeding places and slaughter houses, and the lack of awareness of tickborne diseases among the butchers and the public are the major factors associated with the transmission of CCHF.As the warmer weather approaches and also in view of the coming festival of Eid-ul-Adha, the risk of transmission of CCHF must be assessed and appropriate control measures instituted for slaughtering of animals, use of proper personal protective equipment/clothing, and running public educational campaigns about the prevention and control measures of CCHF.References----------1.
