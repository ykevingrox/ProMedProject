A fisherman at Lutembe, said there was panic among the fishermen, who claimed they had symptoms similar to those of bird flu.The Government responded by testing samples from the dead birds and water in parts of Lutembe Bay.However, contrary to reports from Mbonye that the wild birds at Lutembe had stopped dying, [the fisherman] said they continue to die. ""The experts should come early in the morning and I take them to the roosting grounds. Most of the birds die at night, but scavenging birds and animals eat them in the day,"" he said.Mbonye said the Government set a taskforce to give an update on bird flu on [Tue 24 Jan 2017].Background----------The Government last week [week of 16 Jan 2017] confirmed the outbreak of bird flu on some parts of Lake Victoria shores.The cases of death of wild birds, the white-winged black terns at Lutembe Bay that had persisted for about 2 weeks, were first reported to the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries on [2 Jan 2017].On [13 Jan 12017], another report came from Masaka where domestic ducks and chickens had died at Kachanga village in Bukibanga parish and Bukakata sub-county.The carcasses were delivered to the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Entebbe. It was later confirmed that the deaths were due to bird flu.Symptoms--------The disease has similar symptoms to those of the common flu; it has an incubation period of 3 to 4 days and is accompanied by sneezing, as well as coughing, high temperature, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, and muscle aches, but it does not spread through air.The keepers of birds should watch out for symptoms [in their animals] such as a swollen head, discoloration of the neck, throat, and loss of appetite [as well as] respiratory distress, diarrhoea and when birds lay fewer eggs, according a statement from the Ministry of Health.[Byline: Gerald Tenywa]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The timely response by the Ugandan health department and confirmation that the suspected human cases of avian influenza were a false alarm indicate that some level of preparedness to outbreak threats is in place. However, in view of widespread poultry outbreaks in Asia, Africa and Europe in recent weeks, enhanced surveillance and response capacity, supported by reliable laboratory diagnostic facilities will be essential. - Mod.UBAMaps of Uganda can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1430>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
