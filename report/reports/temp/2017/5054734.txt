Rotherham Advertiser [edited]<http://www.rotherhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/view,rotherham-hospital-visitor-restrictions-after-virus-outbreak_22650.htm>Visitor restrictions have been put in place at Rotherham Hospital due to a virus outbreak. A spokeswoman said: ""The Rotherham Hospital site is currently experiencing an outbreak of rotavirus, a diarrhoea and vomiting bug. At present this is limited to a small number of areas. As a result of this, visiting restrictions have been put in place in the affected areas.""Non-essential visiting on wards A1 and A5 has been stopped and visiting is limited to 2 visitors per patient on wards A4, B4, B5 and the Stroke Unit.Children should not be brought on to these areas, the spokeswoman said, adding: ""If you are considering visiting someone in hospital and have either had symptoms or have been in contact with someone who has had symptoms recently, please ensure you have been clear for at least 48 hours before visiting.""The best prevention for diarrhoea and vomiting is regular hand washing using soap and running water, the spokeswoman said. She added: ""If you are visiting, please ensure that you use the hand gel provided to help us minimise the spread of germs. This is a short term measure and we thank you all for your cooperation.""[Byline: Michael Upton]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[No information on number of cases, the ages of the cases, or the severity of disease is included in this report.A rotavirus infection usually starts within 2 days of exposure to the virus. Initial symptoms are fever and vomiting, followed by 3 to 7 days of watery diarrhea. The infection can cause abdominal pain as well. In adults who are otherwise healthy, rotavirus infection may cause only mild signs and symptoms, or none at all.Rotavirus is present in an infected person's stool several days before symptoms appear and for up to 10 days after symptoms subside. The virus spreads easily through hand-to-mouth contact throughout this time -- even if the infected person doesn't have symptoms.Because there are many types of rotavirus, it's possible to be infected more than once, even if you've been vaccinated. However, repeat infections are typically less severe.Risk factors------------Rotavirus infections are common in children ages 3 to 35 months, particularly those who spend time in child care settings. Older adults and adults caring for young children have an increased risk of infection as well.In the United States, the risk of rotavirus is highest in winter and spring.Severe diarrhea can lead to dehydration, particularly in young children. Left untreated, dehydration can become life-threatening regardless of its cause.(excerpted with minor edits from <http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rotavirus/symptoms-causes/dxc-20186931>)Maps of England, United Kingdom can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>- Mod.LKThe use of rotavirus vaccines has dramatically reduced the morbidity due to this infection and reduced hospitalizations and deaths due to rotavirus in young children.From the ""Pink book"" ""In the prevaccine era an estimated 3 million rotavirus infections occurred every year in the United States and 95% of children experienced at least one rotavirus infection by age 5 years. Rotavirus infection was responsible for more than 400,000 physician visits, more than 200,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 55,000 to 70,000 hospitalizations, and 20 to 60 deaths each year in children younger than 5 years. Annual direct and indirect costs were estimated at approximately $1 billion, primarily due to the cost of time lost from work to care for an ill child.""<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html>  - Mod.LMA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24250>.]
