UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/horn-africa-humanitarian-impacts-drought-issue-6-16-june-2017>Horn of Africa: humanitarian impacts of drought-----------------------------------------------Rainfall--------Somalia: The significant reduction of rainfall across Somalia in the 1st week of June 2017 marks a possible end to the Gu rainy season. The reduction of rainfall within the Juba and Shabelle River basins in Ethiopia and Somalia has led to decreasing river levels which are expected to stabilize in the coming week.Ethiopia: In May 2017, rainfall levels in excess of 125 percent of the long-term average were recorded in northern and eastern Ethiopia. Less than 75 percent of the long-term average rainfall was observed around southern Ethiopia, while below normal rainfall distribution was observed over SNNPR [Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region]. Rainfall forecasts indicate that rainfall is likely to continue during the 1st dekad (10 days) of June 2017 over much of western and central Ethiopia.Kenya: Poorly distributed, erratic, and depressed rainfall was recorded over most of Kenya except for coastal areas where enhanced rainfall exceeding 125 percent of the long-term mean for May 2017. Most parts of the country are expected to remain generally dry in June 2017, except for western and coastal areas which will continue to receive significant amounts of rainfall.Displacement------------Somalia: According to the UNHCR-led Protection and Return Monitoring Network, an estimated 738 600 people have been displaced by drought between November 2016 and May 2017. Of these, nearly 46 000 were displaced in May 2017, a significant decrease in new drought-related displacements compared to previous months. The majority of the newly displaced are from Sanaag (12 570), Lower Shabelle (7200), Bakool (6680), Bay (6250), Sool (3860), and Nugal (3100). Baidoa (160 700) and Mogadishu (160 460) host 42 percent of these displaced people. Reports indicate that people are opting to remain in their areas of origin to cultivate their farms and that the rains have made some roads impassable.Ethiopia: There are 843 367 internally displaced people, more than half of them in the Somali region. In 2017, 220 000 people have been displaced by drought. Gambella town experienced flash floods due to heavy rains in mid-May 2017 and 2395 people were displaced.Kenya: 39 000 people remain displaced due to conflict over resources, insecurity and drought.Disease-------Somalia is experiencing its largest outbreak of cholera in 5 years, with 48 607 cases and 763 deaths reported in 48 districts since January 2017.In Ethiopia, 35 665 acute watery diarrhoea [AWD] cases and 780 deaths (CFR [case fatality rate] 2.2 percent) have been reported in 6 regions since January 2017. The Somali region accounts for more than 91 percent of cases and 96 percent of deaths but the AWD situation has improved with an 88 percent decrease in cases from early April 2017 to the end of May 2017.In Kenya, 303 suspected cases of cholera and 3 deaths have been reported since January 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - SomaliaDate: Sat 17 Jun 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, WHO, Somali Federal Republic Ministry of Health report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/week_23_somalia_awd_cholera_sitrep_week.pdf>Situation report for acute watery diarrhoea/cholera epidemiological week 23 (5-11 Jun 2017)----------------------------------------------------------------------The overall trend shows that the AWD/cholera outbreak is not slowing down. The outbreak is spreading to new villages and districts. There are cholera alerts being reported from Galgadud, Gedo, Togdheer, Bakol, Middle Juba regions, and other inaccessible areas. Verification of these alerts is difficult due to insecurity. The severe drought and its consequences (including water scarcity, food insecurity and malnutrition) are major contributing factors to the ongoing cholera outbreak. More AWD/cholera cases were recorded among people living in IDP [internally displaced persons] camps due to worsening drought in Baidoa, Banadir, and other districts. Response preparations for another cholera outbreak along the main rivers are ongoing since the rainy season has began and major floods are expected. Active transmission of AWD/cholera is ongoing in all districts in Banadir region.2429 AWD/cholera cases and 19 deaths (CFR 0.8 percent) were reported during week 23 from 48 districts in 16 regions. Of these cases, 460 were reported from Wadajir district in Banadir.A cumulative 51 036 suspected AWD/cholera cases and 782 deaths (CFR-1.5 percent) have been recorded from 48 districts across 16 regions since the beginning of 2017. The trend of cholera cases recorded in the past 23 weeks shows a significant increase when compared to cases reported during the same period in 2016. The current AWD/cholera cases were a spill-over from 2016's major outbreak, which recorded 15 619 cases and 548 deaths.Breakdown of AWD/cholera cases by region----------------------------------------- Bay: a total of 81 cases and no deaths were recorded during week 23.

The 1st case was detected 2 weeks ago when another male patient was diagnosed with cholera forcing the county health department to activate its outbreak response.The suspected cholera outbreak has caused panic in the areas where healthcare services have been adversely affected by the ongoing nurses' strike over delayed implementation of their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). There are fears that a full-blown outbreak could overwhelm the skeleton staff at the health facilities. The new case has raised concern among medics that the cholera bacterium could be active and more patients could be suffering from the disease.The Naivasha sub-county hospital superintendent, Dr Joseph Mburu, said the patient who lives in Kabati estate was responding well to treatment. He said the man who lived alone could have picked the bacteria in county council estate where the first case was reported. Mburu said despite the few number of nurses in the facility, they were doing everything possible to contain the outbreak and deal with any new cases.""We are working with officers from the Department of Public Health in sensitising members of the public and schools as one way of addressing these cases,"" he said.He, at the same time, added that the number of patients seeking services at the hospital had continued to drop due to the ongoing strike. Mburu said the male ward has since been closed down adding that they were only admitting emergency cases in the facility. ""We have been forced in some cases mainly in the maternity wing to refer patients to other hospitals as the current number of nurses cannot cope with the workload,"" he said.Mburu added that all they were currently using the few nurses employed by the county government on contract adding that they were only addressing emergency cases. ""We have over 90 nurses employed by the government who are on strike and we are currently relying on the 42 who are on contract,"" he said.[Byline: Kirera Mwiti]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Kenya can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/kck73tk> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174>.

Dr Alinader Minalang, the provincial health officer of Lanao del Sur said more than 300 diarrhea cases were already recorded by their office since the displaced families and individuals from Marawi took temporary refuge in evacuation centers in the area.""The record is based on the daily reports submitted to us,"" Minalang told reporters in an interview on [Mon 19 Jun 2017] morning here [in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte]. He said that of the 2 cases of death due to severe dehydration, one was recorded at the evacuation site in the town of Malabang while the other was in Saguiran municipality [Lanao del Sur]. The evacuees who died, he added were home-based. Another 2 cases of deaths due to diarrhea were recorded in the province but the victims were not evacuees, Minalang clarified. A total of 19 cases of deaths of evacuees have been reported but authorities clarified that the cause of deaths was due to different illnesses.20 percent of the more than 200 000 displaced individuals from Marawi are now staying in various evacuation centers and are confronted with various problems such as congestion, sanitation, lack of enough water supply and food. 80 percent of the evacuees are considered home-based or staying with their relatives in towns, cities, and provinces in various parts of Mindanao.Minalang also denied reports of a case of cholera in one of the evacuation centers. ""We are still confirming the report. We cannot say there is cholera because most of those who are sick are due to acute gastroenteritis are still being subjected to laboratory examinations,"" he pointed out. There is still no basis to conclude that the cause of the increase of acute gastroenteritis cases is due to cholera, he added. He said that cases of acute gastroenteritis usually increase in evacuation centers where people are congested. ""The sanitation facilities in evacuation centers are not enough, especially the toilets and the lack of water supply that they need daily,"" he added. But despite the situation, Minalang said they are trying to address the situation to control the outbreak of acute gastroenteritis among the evacuees.Evacuees at the gymnasium in Balo-i, Lanao del Norte also deal with the problems of congestion and sanitation, said Nesphia Ali of the Department of Social Welfare and Development. The gymnasium presently houses 172 families or 1025 individuals.Acute gastroenteritis is also one of the common illnesses that the recently-concluded National Interfaith Humanitarian Mission found among the 343 patients served in various evacuation centers.The information office of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao said more toilets, bathing and washing facilities will be constructed in evacuation centers to promote hygiene and sanitation and ensure the health and well-being of displaced families.[Byline: Alex D Lopez]--Communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[Maps of the Philippines can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/z4y3p5v> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10621>.

The last known case of cholera in Jamaica occurred 150 years ago. Additionally, there is no increased reporting of gastroenteritis (GE) at our facilities. The reported cases of GE at this time are 30 percent less than recorded for the corresponding period in 2016.On 9 Jun 2017, the Ministry was notified of a patient presenting with abdominal pain and fever. Routine investigations identified a bacterium in the patient's blood. Based on the patient's presentation, this bacteria is not consistent with the _Vibrio cholerae_ species associated with severe diarrheal illness, commonly known as 'cholera'. The patient did not have diarrhea and contacts of that patient report no symptoms suggestive of cholera. A sample for confirmation has been sent for testing to CARPHA [Caribbean Public Health Agency] in Trinidad. No other patient is being investigated for cholera in our facilities.Since the reintroduction of cholera in the region in 2010, the Ministry of Health has heightened its surveillance of the disease. The Ministry also continues to bolster its health services to identify suspected cases of cholera and mitigate any potential effects on the population.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Jamaica can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/Jamaica/static-maps/gif/map-of-jamaica> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/26>.Although not specifically stated, it is implied that the patient had a Vibrio-related bacteremia and that it was caused by a non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_.
