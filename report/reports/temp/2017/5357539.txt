WKRG [edited]<http://goo.gl/Y6TSM5>A 7th case of _Vibrio_ infection has been confirmed in Mobile County. This is the 1st ""flesh-eating bacteria"" [necrotizing fasciitis - Mod.LL] case in the county. The Mobile County Health Department says the individual contracted an unknown _Vibrio_ species near Dog River. The patient is recovering in a local hospital from the serious bacterial skin infection necrotizing fasciitis. ""Of the more than 70 species of _Vibrio_ that exist, the exact species in this case has not yet been identified,"" said the Health Department in a statement. ""Test results do confirm it is non cholera.""The 1st case dealt with an individual who consumed raw oysters while in another state during March 2017. The majority of _Vibrio_ cases reported each year come from eating raw shellfish. The 2nd incident took place in April 2017, and involved the consumption of raw oysters while in Mobile County. An investigation confirmed that the oysters were imported from another state and were not harvested locally. 2 other cases took place during June 2017 and came from wound exposure while in bodies of waters near Dauphin Island, the Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay. The 5th case of _Vibrio_ infection was reported at the end of July 2017. Despite intensive research, not enough information was available to pinpoint an exact source for the bacterium, which was identified as _V. cholerae_ non O1, non O139. Investigators said the mystery of where the patient came in contact with the bacteria may never be solved. In August 2017, a 6th case of involved a Mobile County resident who was off-shore, not in Gulf Coastal waters, from an open wound while in water.Of the 1st 4 reports, 2 cases were identified as _V. vulnificus_, 2 were _V. parahaemolyticus_, and the other was _V. fluvialis_. According to the CDC, about a dozen _Vibrio_ species can cause human illness, known as vibriosis. _Vibrio_ bacteria naturally live in certain coastal waters and are present in higher concentrations between May and October when water temperatures are warmer. However the bacteria can be present throughout the year in some areas.The 1st 6 cases involving Mobile County residents were considered mild, and did not involve necrotizing fasciitis. According to the CDC, most people who get necrotizing fasciitis have other health problems that may lower their body's ability to fight infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Of the species of _Vibrio_, _V. vulnificus_ is the one most likely to cause necrotizing fasciitis especially in individuals with certain predisposing conditions such as chronic liver and kidney disease. The species in this case is not known as yet. Despite this, other species of _Vibrio_ can also cause necrotizing fasciitis as documented with _V. parahaemolyticus_ in:Tena D, Arias M, Alvarez T, et al: Fulminant necrotizing fasciitis due to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. J Med Microbiol 2010; 59(Pt 2): 235-8; <http://jmm.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.014654-0#tab2>Abstract--------""Necrotizing soft-tissue infection due to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is unusual. We report a case of necrotizing fasciitis due to _V. parahaemolyticus_ in a 92-year-old woman with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition. Clinical evolution was fulminant and the patient died 6 hours after admission. A review of all cases previously reported showed that the infection occurred in patients with underlying diseases through ingestion of raw oysters or inoculation via traumatic injury in marine environments. The mortality rate of all reviewed cases was 42.8 percent. In conclusion, _V. parahaemolyticus_ should be considered a possible causative agent of necrotizing fasciitis, especially in patients with underlying disease. Early diagnosis and prompt aggressive debridement associated with antibiotic therapy are essential in order to save the patient's life, because clinical evolution can be fulminant and mortality rates are high.""The state of Alabama can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8322>.
