PAHO/WHO Zika - Epidemiological Update [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=38610>Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------Since epidemiological week (EW) 44 of 2016 [29 Oct-4 Nov 2016], no additional countries or territories of the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus. To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.Figure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.[Footnote to map:(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; CuraÌ¤ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint BarthÌ©lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.North AmericaIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.In Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].Central AmericaThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].In Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].In Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.CaribbeanIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.In CuraÌ¤ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].In Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].While other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.South AmericaIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of CÌ rdoba and TucumÌÁn.In Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].In Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San MartÌ n, and Ucayali.In other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.Trend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South AmericaFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.Figure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

In EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017], Saint Martin reported a confirmed case of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection for the 1st time.In the last 4 weeks, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, French Guyana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States of America, updated their number of cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection.As of 1 Sep 2016, the table with the number of confirmed cases of congenital syndrome is published on a weekly basis on the PAHO/WHO website and is available at <http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12390&Itemid=42090>.Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disordersIn EW 7 of 2017 [week ending 17 Feb 2017], CuraÌ¤ao and Trinidad and Tobago reported cases of Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) associated with Zika virus infection for the 1st time.The trend of Zika cases and associated GBS cases is shown in Figure 3. The declining Zika trend is accompanied by a similar trend for GBS cases.Figure 3 [graph].

April 2017 ahead of print. (conf.) 7 cases of severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic signs and symptoms after infection with Zika virus. Clinical course and laboratory findings strongly suggest a causal link between Zika virus infection and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/4/16-1967_article>[This report provides some clinical support for antibody-dependent enhancement of Zika virus infection. A recently published review emphasizes the critical role for epidemiologic studies (retrospective and prospective) in combination with the studies to identify specific sites of Zika virus infection in humans that are needed to establish antibody-dependent enhancement as a possibility or a reality.

(reported) 9 patients, ages 30-64, treated at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Caracas developed heart symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue an average of 10 days after typical Zika symptoms began. Only one had any prior heart-related problem. Over 6 months, 8 of the 9 developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem, and 6 of the 9 developed heart failure.<http://whnt.com/2017/03/13/doctors-tie-zika-virus-to-heart-problems-in-some-adults/>
