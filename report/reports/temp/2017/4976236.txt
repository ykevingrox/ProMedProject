People have been educated to quickly report to the nearest hospital once they experience symptoms such as fever, vomiting and stiffness of the neck. With this, more people have been coming and the situation has stabilised as no more high report of confirmed cases,"" he said.He said that vaccination would commence immediately [after] the state receives the type [serogroup] C meningitis vaccines from international communities. He advised people to desist from self-medication and report to hospital when they notice any sign of CSM.Nau'zo also advised people to always leave windows and doors open to ensure ventilation in their homes. To avoid the spread of the disease, he urged people to wash their hands always.
