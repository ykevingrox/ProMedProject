Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.arcinfo.ch/articles/regions/jura-jura-bernois/un-deuxieme-cas-de-fievre-charbonneuse-dans-le-jura-671878>A 2nd bovine animal with anthrax was discovered on the Jura farm where a 1st case had already been detected. After the discovery of a 1st case of anthrax on the Jura farm, a surveillance system was set up by the Consumer and Veterinary Affairs Department (Scav) of the Canton of Jura. This detected a 2nd bovine infected with this epizootic of bacterial origin, also transmissible to humans.On [Fri 12 May 2017], a bovine from the Jura farm, which had already been sequestered, revealed suspicious clinical symptoms. The Scav then took him to the Institute of Animal Pathology at the University of Bern for additional examinations. The examination there confirmed on [Wed 17 May 2017] that the animal was infected with _Bacillus anthracis_.This bovine is part of the same herd as the 1st case and has most likely been in contact with the same infectious source. Other animals have no [signs -- animals do not have symptoms. - Mod.MHJ] to date. Investigations are still under way to find the [original] source of infection at this farm.[Byline: Christian Galley]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is not unexpected. The 1st case was a dead animal on [Wed 26 April 2017]. The incubation period for 'Anthrax' is dose dependent and so a 2nd animal with a smaller exposure will have a longer incubation period and will have time to displays signs, usually an increased temperature. Such respond well to antibiotic treatment. Let us hope that they kept a blood sample before initiating treatment so that the pathogen can be submitted to a genomic analysis. This information may indicate where the pathogen came from. The last case of bovine anthrax in Jura was in 1993.A map showing the location of this outbreak is in the previous report.-- 8 May 2017 Anthrax - Switzerland: (JU) bovine 20170508.5021892, and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105>.And with thanks to Susan for her translation. - Mod.MHJ]
