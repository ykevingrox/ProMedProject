At least 25 cows owned by local residents were reported dead suddenly in Tumbuo Hamlet, Tenilo. Cow carcasses are feared will spread the bacteria to humans and can also kill more cows.""We have received reports of the cow's death in Tumbuo Village,"" said Vivi Tayeb, Head of Animal Health and Veterinary Public Health, Gorontalo district on [Mon 28 Aug 2017].After receiving the report, Vivi Tayeb and the team headed straight for the village on the outskirts of Lake Limboto to conduct the examination. The results of examination of dozens of cows showed they were affected by anthrax. ""We immediately did the vaccinations so [the infection will not]spread to other cows,"" said Vivi Tayeb.Vivi explained that as many as 2560 head of cattle in Dusun Tumbuo have been vaccinated. This number will continue to grow until all the cows in Gorontalo District are vaccinated. Vivi added that an outbreak of anthrax, also took place last year [2016] at which time several cows were suddenly found dead.A number of people were skeptical and still ate [anthrax] infected cows; as a result, they were rushed to the hospital after contracting anthrax.There are allegations that more than 25 cows died this week because of anthrax. Because cases in rural areas might not be reported to the government, it makes it difficult for officials to undertake full vaccinations.--Communicated by:Sabine ZentisCastleview English LonghornsGut LaachD-52385 NideggenGermany<cvlonghorns@aol.com>[Tenilo is in Gorontalo District in northern Sulawesi.

But Fallingrain lists 4 Tenilo villages/towns in Gorontalo; for two go to: <https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=10895702&fid=2378&c=indonesia> and <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ID/34/Tenilo3.html>.Livestock anthrax is a constant problem in Sulawesi though most outbreaks and the worst are in south Sulawesi (Sulawesi Selatan). Outbreaks in northern Sulawesi (Sulawesi Barat) are usually less frequent and less severe. It is unfortunate that with last year's [2016] experience they had not vaccinated this year [2017] in northern Sulawesi and prevent this bad outbreak.
