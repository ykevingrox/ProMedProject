Otago Daily News [edited]<https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/mumps-vigilance-advised-cases-increase>Otago schools are warning parents to be vigilant as health officials express fears of an outbreak of mumps in New Zealand. Public health deputy director Harriette Carr said there had been 39 ""confirmed and probable cases'' of mumps reported in New Zealand, between 1 Sep 2016 and 1 Mar 2017. The number was up to 3 times higher than for the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years.Most of the cases were reported from the Auckland region (26 cases). Other affected district health board areas are Northland (3 cases), Lakes (3), Capital and Coast, Canterbury (2 each), Taranaki, Hutt Valley and West Coast (1 each). ""16 of the cases were likely to have been acquired overseas,'' Dr Carr said.The age range of affected persons is 2 to 34 years, with about half the cases occurring in school-aged children and half in young adults. ""Though spread has been limited at this stage, there is an increased risk of further outbreaks, particularly given the start of the year for schools and universities,"" said Dr Carr.Otago Primary Principals' Association chairwoman and Musselburgh School principal Debbie Smith said schools were being cautious in light of the threat. ""I would make sure there's something in school newsletters so people can be aware of it. Principals should follow the Ministry of Health's lead, and I suggest that parents keep an eye out."" The Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education advised that the best prevention against the disease was immunisation with 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), which is free.Taking action before a mumps outbreak could minimise the effect or spread of the illness, Dr Carr said. ""School and university staff, educators, students and parents can help prevent mumps spreading in the community by making sure that their immunisations and their children's immunisations are up to date. If they are unsure, encourage them to check with their family doctor. Anybody not fully vaccinated with MMR for their age must get vaccinated, that is, all school-age and older students must have had 2 doses of MMR,"" she said.- Mumps is a disease notifiable to the local medical health officer.- Symptoms include sore and swollen areas under the jaw/around the face, usually accompanied or preceded by fever, muscle soreness, poor appetite, fatigue and headache.- If a person develops symptoms of mumps, isolate them from others.- Susceptible people include those born after 1981 who have not had a mumps infection or have not been fully vaccinated.- People with mumps, and those who have been exposed to mumps, should not attend education or workplaces or mix with other susceptible people while they are infectious.- A person can be infectious for 7 days before the swelling of the salivary gland(s), and for 5 days after the swelling has gone down.- Complications include orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) in adult males; oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries and/or breast tissue [mastitis]) in adult females; inflammation of the brain (encephalitis); inflammation of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis); and deafness.- Following a case of mumps, the local medical officer of health will make the decision on the exclusion from educational facilities of susceptible children or adults exposed to the case.[byline: John Lewis]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of New Zealand can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>. - Mod.LK]******[2] USA [Oklahoma (Tulsa)]Date: 8 Mar 2017Source: Fox 23 News [edited]<http://www.fox23.com/news/tulsa-health-department-investigates-local-outbreak-of-mumps/500878702>The Tulsa Health Department (THD) is currently investigating an outbreak of mumps in Tulsa County.

Not all cases are Dallas County residents. Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) is reporting 39 mumps cases in Dallas County for 2017.In addition, DCHHS has a separate total of 9 additional unrelated mumps cases in the city of Mesquite and Dallas.DCHHS health officials are urging immunization to protect against and prevent the spread of mumps. People who have had 2 mumps vaccinations (such as 2 MMR vaccines) are usually considered immune to mumps. A 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine is only recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when an individual is associated with an ongoing outbreak.""At 2 doses, the MMR vaccine is very impactful, at 88 per cent effectiveness,"" said Dr Christopher Perkins, Dallas County medical director/health authority. ""A 3rd dose is recommended if you have been associated with an outbreak. Ensuring you are up to date with your vaccination is the best protection in addition to washing hands frequently and cleaning/disinfecting objects or surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.""DCHHS provides the 1st and 2nd dose of the MMR vaccine for children and adults. ... ""The increased number of mumps cases reported in the North Texas area underscores the importance of getting vaccinated,"" said DCHHS director Zachary Thompson.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] USA (Colorado)Date: Sat 10 Mar 2017Source: The Denver Channel [edited]<http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/mumps-outbreak-pushes-colorado-past-infection-record>The number of mumps cases in Colorado continues to grow and has surpassed the state record amid an outbreak that has spread through several states. Health officials on Fri [10 Mar 2017] said they'd registered a total of 53 cases of mumps in the state since 1 Jan 2017. The old record was 51 cases following an outbreak in 2006. Colorado averages just 5.6 cases a year. Last year [2016], there were 17 cases.Mumps is an infection spread by direct human-to-human contact through respiratory droplets or saliva. Average incubation periods range from 16 to 18 days on average but up to 12 to 25 days.Symptoms of the infection aren't limited to swelling of salivary and parotid glands across the cheek and jaw area; swelling can range from the frontal part of the ear and spread as fluid builds up. Other symptoms can at times include low-grade fevers, malaise, loss of appetite, headache and more, but not all who have mumps will exhibit symptoms. Severe complications from the infection are rare, but can include sterility, spontaneous abortion, deafness and more.Officials advise ensuring family members are up to date on the MMR vaccine, noting that 2 doses of the vaccine are recommended for children. Even those who are vaccinated are susceptible to mumps, as the vaccine is only roughly 88 per cent effective, and effectiveness can wane after the vaccine has been administered.[byline: Kurt Sevits]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A ProMED-mail/HealthMap of the US showing the location of Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>. - Mod.LK]
