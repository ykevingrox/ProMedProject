The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services [NH DHHS] said it is the 1st human case of Jamestown Canyon virus [JCV] in the state in 2017. It is the state's 3rd case of the virus found in a human. The 1st case was in May 2013 and the 2nd was in November 2015.""Jamestown Canyon Virus is one of several viral infections that can be transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito in New Hampshire,"" said State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan. ""It is an uncommon infection to be found, but similar to West Nile Virus [WNV] and Eastern Equine Encephalitis [EEE], it also has the potential to cause serious health complications, including central nervous system infection. Because of the risk for various infections from mosquitoes, we want to remind people to take steps to avoid mosquito bites and remove areas of standing water around their homes where mosquitoes might breed and reproduce.""JCV primary is found in deer and a variety of mosquito species in North America. Since 2000, more than 50 human cases of JCV have been identified nationally. A man in Maine tested positive for the virus in July [2017].JCV usually is asymptomatic but it can result in a mild fever or more serious central nervous system complications, including meningitis and encephalitis, according to NH DHHS. There is no specific treatment.DHHS said the best way to prevent infection from JCV and other mosquito-borne illnesses like WNV and EEE is to prevent mosquito bites.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Cases of Jamestown Canyon (JCV) virus infection occur sporadically across the northern tier of states in the USA, from New England to Montana. The occurrence of JCV in New Hampshire is not surprising. As noted in the above report, a case occurred earlier this year (2017) in the neighboring state of Maine.As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit the virus. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_ are the principal amplification hosts.As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease, and provided the following references:1.
