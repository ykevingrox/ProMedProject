Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19790>. - Mod.TY******[2] USA, New MexicoDate: Fri 7 Apr 2017Source: New Mexico Health Department press release [edited]<https://nmhealth.org/news/disease/2017/4/?view=552>The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) announced today [Fri 7 Apr 2017] that a 54-year-old man from San Juan County has died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). This is the 2nd case of HPS confirmed in New Mexico this year [2017]. An environmental investigation has been conducted at the man's home to help reduce the risk to others.Hantavirus [infections can cause] a severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in humans transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. People can contract the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus. The deer mouse is the main carrier for Sin Nombre virus, the Hantavirus strain found in New Mexico.""With the recent warm weather in New Mexico, people are starting spring cleaning. We urge New Mexicans to mindful when they are opening up sheds, cabins, and other buildings that have been closed up for the winter as mice and other rodents may have moved in,"" said Dr Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health Veterinarian. ""Stirring up dust in areas of rodent infestation, including nests and droppings, can cause the virus to get into the air where the particles can be breathed in. It's best to air out cabins and sheds before entering them and wet down droppings with a disinfectant.""NMDOH encourages healthcare workers and the public to become familiar with the signs and symptoms of Hantavirus. Early symptoms of Hantavirus infection include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, and cough which progresses to respiratory distress. These symptoms develop within one to 6 weeks after rodent exposure. Although there is no specific treatment for HPS, chances for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early.Important steps to prevent contracting Hantavirus include: - Air out closed-up buildings before entering - Trap mice until they are all gone - Clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant - Don't sweep up rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled - Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home - Get rid of trash and junk piles - Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to itNMDOH identified a case of HPS earlier this year in a 64-year-old woman from McKinley County who recovered. In 2016, there were 8 cases of HPS with 5 fatalities in New Mexico--Communicated by:Paul Ettestad DVM, MSState Public Health VeterinarianInfectious Disease Epidemiology BureauEpidemiology and Response DivisionNew Mexico Department of Health<Paul.Ettestad@state.nm.us[ProMED thanks Dr. Paul Ettestad <Paul.Ettestad@state.nm.us> for sending in this report. He commented that his impression was that deer mice populations were higher this year [2017], but he had no definite statistics to confirm his suspicions. Deer mouse populations are known to fluctuate significantly over time. The report above indicates that the hantavirus involved in this, and doubtless earlier cases, is Sin Nombre virus. Its rodent host is the deer mouse (_Peromyscus manicuatus_). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms mentioned above should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter should heed the precautions that the Department of Health recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of New Mexico can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233> and a map showing the location of San Juan County in northwestern New Mexico at <http://geology.com/county-map/new-mexico.shtml>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233>.]
