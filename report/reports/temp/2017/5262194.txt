India Times [edited]<http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/17-people-fall-ill-after-chlorine-gas-leakage-in-dehradun-328089.html>In the early hours of [Fri 18 Aug 2017], 17 people, including 5 children, were taken ill after chlorine gas leakage from a cylinder at a waterworks unit of Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan in Dehradun.Police rushed to the spot immediately and threw the leaking cylinder into the water to neutralise it, SP (City) Pradeep Kumar Rai, told PTI.People living in the waterworks area including children, mostly sleeping at that hour, were rushed to different hospitals in the city after they complained of difficulty in breathing and some of them especially children even fainted, the SP (city) said.Altogether 17 people were hospitalized: 8 were admitted in Mahanth Indresh hospital, 5 in Max Hospital, and 4 in CMI hospital, the SP said.However, all of them are out of danger with a majority already discharged from hospitals, he said.The Managing Director of Jan Sansthan said an inquiry is being conducted into the gas leak at the waterworks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[I am not quite sure how children got exposed from a leaking canister at a waterworks unit, especially since this was in the early hours of the morning. Where the homes near there? Perhaps above the waterworks unit? How big was the cylinder to cause this kind of problem? These are likely rhetorical questions but answers would provide insight into what really happened.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1475>.Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract.Exposure to low concentrations of chlorine for prolonged periods may have destructive effects, as might very short-term exposure to high concentrations.Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.How chlorine works- The extent of poisoning caused by chlorine depends on the amount of chlorine a person is exposed to, how the person was exposed, and the length of time of the exposure.- When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throat, and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage these tissues.Immediate signs and symptoms of chlorine exposureDuring or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop:- blurred vision;- burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine;- burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes;- coughing;- chest tightness;- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled;- fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours;- nausea and vomiting;- watery eyes;- wheezingLong-term health effectsLong-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.Portions of this comment have been extracted from <http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/chlorine/basics/facts.asp>. - Mod.TG]
