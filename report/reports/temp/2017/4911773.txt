While 5 others affected by anthrax are undergoing treatment at the Rourkela government hospital, 4 are admitted to the Bisra hospital.To ascertain the reasons behind the spread of anthrax in the area, a team of doctors today [18 Mar 2017] visited Birikeri village and collected blood samples of the residents in the area.Asked about how he came to know he was affected by anthrax, AT, a patient, said: ""Initially, boils appeared on the skin, and thereafter it grew in size and ruptured. That's how I thought of being anthrax-affected. As animal carcasses are either buried or thrown in the open, the environment is getting polluted to help anthrax spread.""Deputy CMO of the Rourkela Government Hospital SK Kabisatpathy commented: ""The hospital medicine specialist and skin specialist have clinically identified the disease as anthrax. Therefore, antibiotics have been given to the patients.""He further stated: ""The CDMO office located in Sundargarh has been told about the spread of anthrax, a notifiable disease, in Birikeri. A team of doctors today [18 Mar 2017] visited the area and collected blood samples for laboratory tests.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a description and map of Sundergarh go to:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundergarh_district>.Anthrax is a constant problem in Odisha, both in livestock and wildlife. In September 2016, the state government was talking of instituting a veterinary control and surveillance programme; see 27 Sep 2016 Anthrax - India (27): (OR) endemic district vaccination planned 20160927.4518848. It would have a major impact and set a standard for other Indian states similarly afflicted. Let us hope that implementation is at hand.In the meanwhile, they should not leave the village investigation to the medics. Anthrax is basically an animal problem that spills over into humans. To find out what really happened, you need a veterinarian in the villages checking for recently sick and dead livestock and making absolutely sure that the carcasses are properly disposed of, preferably burnt. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>.]
