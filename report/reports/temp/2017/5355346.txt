People have turned to professionals with complaints of ulcers. Then on Wed 30 Aug 2017, 3 people were hospitalized."" But this official report to OIE in Paris mentions a dead cow on 1 Sep 2017. The details may be confused but this human series of cases -- 3 hospitalised and 15 under medical supervision -- came from access to a single dead cow, either during the slaughter and butchering, or to the meat from the carcass at the time or at some market. Very expensive. Which is why it is so important that herds in known risk areas or regions should be proactively vaccinated each spring. This prevents animals sickening and dying and cows are valuable; it prevents spread to neighbouring herds via biting flies; and it prevents humans being exposed and having to be medically treated and sometimes hospitalised, or even dying.All this expense and worry are prevented by vaccinating your livestock, which is much, much cheaper. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63209>.]
