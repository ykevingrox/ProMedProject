It was earlier reported that more than 50 people attending 'The Kenya International Scientific Lung Health Conference' had the disease. Reports from some doctors indicated 60 people were rushed to Nairobi's Kenyatta National Hospital.""Afternoon doctors should come in early as more patients are being rushed in,"" read a text message one of the doctors sent his colleagues. Medics tested patients who suffered diarrhea and vomiting. At least 10 guests, including 3 doctors attending the conference, had abdominal cramps after having lunch.Medics who attended them could not confirm the infection but Nairobi Health CEC Bernard Muia said it was unlikely to be cholera. ""They had diarrhea not typical of cholera, abdominal pains and vomiting,"" he said. Muia said samples were taken to the public health laboratories in the city for testing. ""It's most probably food poisoning and could be gastroenteritis, a very common condition that causes diarrhea and vomiting,"" he told The Star.Dr George Nyale, chairman of the conference organized by the Health ministry, confirmed the outbreak but said there was no cause for alarm. In the afternoon, 2 of the guests were admitted at Nairobi hospital, 1 Karen Hospital and another at the Aga Khan facility.The Weston scare came as officers from the Naivasha department of public health investigated 9 suspected cases of cholera. The patients suffering diarrhea and other symptoms related to cholera were treated at Naivasha sub-county hospital where 2 cases were confirmed. A man who had the disease was treated and discharged.A junior officer, who did not want to be named as he is not authorized to address the press, said the 9 cases were from different estates in the town. The officer added that some of the patients were relatives of 2 cholera patients earlier treated at the hospital. ""We have treated 9 suspected cases of cholera and have put in place all measures to avoid another outbreak, especially now that it's raining heavily,"" said the officer.Dr Joseph Mburu, superintendent in charge of the county hospital, confirmed by phone that the last patient had been released. ""The county has dispatched the outbreak response team and supplied enough drugs after the 2 positive cases,"" said the officer.[Byline: Nancy Agutu and John Muchangi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The seemingly short incubation period suggests that _V. cholerae_ is not the etiology in this hotel conference-associated outbreak of gastrointestinal disease. - Mod.LL]******[3] Shigellosis - Australia (Queensland)Date: Wed 21 Jun 2017, 3:50 PMSource: South Burnett Times [edited]<https://www.southburnetttimes.com.au/news/outbreak-of-shigella-in-cherbourg-and-murgon/3192091/>An outbreak of the Shigella bacteria has been reported in Cherbourg and Murgon. The Darling Donws Hospital and Health Service has urged residents to take extra hygiene precautions to manage the outbreak of the highly infectious bacterium, _Shigella_.Darling Downs Public Health Unit (DDPHU) Director Dr Penny Hutchinson said bacterium was transmitted person-to-person or through food. ""The most important thing people can do is thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water, especially after using the toilet or changing nappies and before handling food,"" Dr Hutchinson said.""Symptoms include diarrhea typically containing blood and mucous, accompanied by fever, nausea and vomiting. We have alerted the 2 local hospitals and the GP practices to the outbreak, and provided information posters to community facilities such as schools and child care centres on what control measures should be in place.""Anyone suffering from diarrhea should see their doctor and get tested.[Byline: Tobi Loftus]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3991>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285>.]
