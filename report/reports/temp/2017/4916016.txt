News24 reports the Limpopo health department on [Tue 14 Mar 2017] confirmed at least 46 cases of malaria had been reported in the western Waterberg district around Lephalale and Thabazimbi. The department's spokesperson Thabiso Teffo stated no fatalities had been reported. ""It is an area that does not normally have malaria mosquitoes. We also worried that 70 percent of the cases reported were people who had not travelled. It means they had contracted malaria in the area they stay.""

The concern is that the cases are uncommon because it's an area where we don't expect malaria.[Byline: Selene Brophy]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The report mentions districts in both Botswana and South Africa.
