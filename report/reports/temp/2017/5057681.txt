Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/meningitis-established-cause-liberia-cluster-99790/>In a follow-up on the cluster of acute illness and sudden deaths in Liberia, the World Health Organization (WHO) says the etiology has been established as meningococcal meningitis.Out of 24 samples analysed, 13 were confirmed as _Neisseria meningitidis_ serotype C using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. In addition, 4 out of the 5 cases that manifested typical clinical features of meningococcal disease [purpura fulminans (seen in 4 cases), ecchymosis (2 cases), petechial rashes (4 cases), and abdominal pain (4 cases)] were confirmed.In this case, the infectious pathogen (_Neisseria meningitidis_ serotype C) caused meningococcal disease (septicemia an infection of blood) as opposed to meningococcal meningitis (infection of the meninges), which is common in West, Central and East Africa. Meningococcal disease outbreak is very rare in West Africa.The overall situation of the outbreak in Liberia has greatly improved and no new cases and deaths have been reported.As of 19 May 2017, a total of 31 cases including 13 deaths (case fatality rate of 42 percent) have been reported from Sinoe (27 cases and 10 deaths), Montserrado (2 cases and 2 deaths) and Grand Bassa (2 cases and one death) [counties]. The last case was reported on 7 May 2017 while the last death occurred on 2 May 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The initial identification of the etiological agent, _Neisseria mengitidis_ , in these cases was done by the USA CDC. The USA CDC sent 2 meningitis laboratory scientists and one meningitis senior epidemiologist to Liberia to join the staff from the CDC Country Office in Liberia in the investigation This bacterium is very likely responsible for all the reported cases. Fortunately, there have been no new cases reported since 7 May 2017, so the outbreak appears to have ended.
