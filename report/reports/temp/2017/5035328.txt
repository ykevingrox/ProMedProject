That's because rat lungworm disease-carrying slugs can curl up in garden hoses and could pass the brain-invading parasite on through the water.Rat lungworm disease is caused by a parasite found in rats and passed on to snails, slugs and some freshwater animals like prawns, shrimp and fish.Victims are infected after ingesting the parasite. Rats excrete the larvae which is ingested by the slug or snail.Produce -- such as green, leafy plants -- attract snails and slugs, and the infected veggies or animals are consumed by victims.[Byline: Patti Waller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The new cases indicate that the infection is endemic in slugs and snails in Hawaii. A proper case-control study is needed to obtain a clearer idea of risk factors and transmission routes. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/214>.]
