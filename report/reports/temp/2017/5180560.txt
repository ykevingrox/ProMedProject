JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individual above probably had not been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.Maps of Taiwan can be seen at <http://www.tmf.org.tw/index.php/maps-taiwan> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/44381>. - Mod.TY]
