The Boston Globe [edited]<https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/13/now-sick-major-coli-outbreak/Z5d4dLCvEDYn2weelNs4cK/story.html>Another case of _Escherichia coli_ infection linked to Chicken & Rice Guys food outlets was identified [on Thu 13 Apr 2017], bringing to 15 the tally of people sickened in one of the bigger foodborne illness outbreaks to strike the state [Massachusetts]. State and municipal health officials were testing food from the restaurants and samples from about 120 food handlers associated with the now-shuttered Chicken & Rice Guys restaurants and food trucks, in the hope of pinpointing the source of the illnesses.A total of 10 people in the outbreak required hospitalization, a high percentage. But Dr Anita Barry, director of the Infectious Disease Bureau at the Boston Public Health Commission, said none of those infected had developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, the deadly side effect of _E. coli_ infections that can shut down the kidneys. Instead, she said, they were most likely hospitalized because of bloody diarrhea, one of the symptoms of infection with the organism officially known as Shiga-toxin producing _E. coli_ O157:H7. Other symptoms include abdominal cramps and dehydration. Officials had no information on the victims' condition, but Barry said some had been discharged from hospitals.Health officials expressed confidence that, with the restaurants temporarily closed, there is little continuing risk to public health -- even though 3 of the victims did not recall eating at Chicken & Rice Guys, which has 3 restaurants in Boston and one in Medford, plus a fleet of food trucks. No other food establishment is under investigation.None of those sickened are children or elderly people, the groups most vulnerable to the ill effects of this infection. Most are in their 20s, with a few in their 30s and 40s, according to Kevin Cranston, director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease at the state Department of Public Health, which is investigating the outbreak along with municipal health authorities. 9 of the 15 victims live in Boston, Barry said, and the rest in nearby cities and towns in Middlesex and Suffolk counties. The 1st victim fell ill 30 Mar 2017 and the most recent on 4 Apr 2017.""This is a pretty substantial outbreak"" for one that thus far appears to be limited to Massachusetts, Cranston said. ""The reality is most people eat in restaurants and don't get sick,"" he added. ""This is an exception to the rule."" Based on past experience, the most likely scenario is that a sick employee contaminated the food, Cranston said. The employee could have touched food that was then taken to more than one Chicken & Rice Guys outlet. Another possibility is that a food ingredient commonly used at Chicken & Rice Guys -- but not common elsewhere -- became contaminated. But the source may never be identified.Boston inspection officials could not recall another _E. coli_ outbreak in the city. William ""Buddy"" Christopher, commissioner of Boston's Inspectional Services Division, said the current outbreak is unique for involving a business with so many parts. Chicken & Rice Guys has 4 eat-in or take-out restaurants, 5 food trucks, and a kitchen commissary in Somerville that supplies the food it sells on its trucks. ""This is the 1st time we've seen _E. coli_ in multiple locations,"" Christopher said. Christopher said there have been no significant health code violations at the chain in recent years. An inspection of the Allston restaurant [on Tue 11 Apr 2017], found 6 violations of city health and safety codes, although none was deemed critical. Violations included a failure to properly cool food at room temperature and greasy build-up on a grill, but inspectors found no risk factors for foodborne illness.Chicken & Rice Guys can reopen its restaurants and trucks after all food handlers have tested negative for _E. coli_ twice, and after local inspectors determine that each outlet complies with food codes.Eric F Nusbaum, who heads the Wheelwright Consultants restaurant and food safety advisory group in Greenfield, said while _E. coli_ O157 is linked to animals and traditionally found in meat products, most recent cases have been linked to contaminated produce. ""You're dealing with a natural product that has to be grown with exposure to animals and birds if they fly over and defecate on produce,"" he said. He added that Massachusetts food safety regulations are more stringent than federal oversight requires, and that the state has far fewer cases of foodborne illness as a result. ""The good news is that food is safer than it's ever been the US,"" he said. ""But there is still a risk.""The 1st cases in the recent outbreak came to light [on 5 Apr 2017], when the Boston Public Health Commission received a report of a positive laboratory test for _E. coli_, followed quickly by additional cases. On [Fri 7 Apr 2017], the Department of Public Health and the Boston Public Health Commission alerted health care professionals to be vigilant for _E. coli_ symptoms and to collect samples for testing. Meanwhile, public health nurses interviewed victims, asking what and where they ate in the 7 days before developing symptoms. A large majority recalled eating at a Chicken & Rice Guys outlet, enough to make the chain a prime suspect and prompt its closing [Tue 11 Apr 2017].[byline: Felice J Freyer, Megan Woolhouse, Janelle Nanos]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ are zoonotic bacteria of livestock, particularly cattle and can be transmitted to humans in a variety of ways, including via undercooked meat (especially ground beef), direct contact with animals such as at a petting zoo and contamination (at any time from the field, during harvest, during processing, or in a restaurant or home) of produce. _E. coli_ O157:H7 is the prototypic strain and was the strain associated with the initial fast food outbreak of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome from undercooked ground beef in the early 1980s. Since the incubation period of this infection can be as long as 10 days after exposure and is longer than the usual enteric infection, additional primary cases may still occur. Also, secondary household cases can occur.ProMED-mail awaits additional information regarding this potentially growing outbreak. Of note, neither chicken nor rice are considered common vehicles for transmission so rather a food such as a salad may be to blame. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/224>.]
