The Korea Times [edited]<http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/phone/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=235072>5 Korean students who visited India have been stricken with typhoid fever. The students are from Sangmyung University's Cheonan Campus in South Chungcheong Province, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on [Mon 21 Aug 2017]. They had visited India's northern region, including the cities of Agra and New Delhi, with 18 other students and 2 instructors as part of the school's overseas education program from [19 to 27 Jul 2017].After they returned, 7 sought medical attention for fever, chills, and diarrhea. 4 were diagnosed with typhoid. In a follow-up check, another student was diagnosed with the disease. 4 of the 5 students remain in a hospital. One student was released on [Fri 18 Aug 2017].Of 225 Koreans who caught typhoid fever abroad between 2011-2016, 23 per cent had visited India. The health authority has advised that people planning to visit India should be vaccinated against the waterborne disease, which is also infectious through food.Health officials also said that people who experience fever, chills, and diarrhea within 60 days -- the disease's maximum latency period -- after returning from India must report to a hospital to be checked for the disease.[byline: Ko Dong-hwan]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, often has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the commoner types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly [both liver and spleen enlarged]. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (""rose spots"") are about 2 cm [0.78 in] in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.Maps of South Korea can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/jvukf5u> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/15392 >.
