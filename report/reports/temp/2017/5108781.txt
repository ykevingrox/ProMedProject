Classified as a primary case but high risk exposures were still under investigation at the time of initial confirmation report. - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Well, so much for my optimism that transmission has slowed down. In the past 2 days, there have been 6 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Riyadh Saudi Arabia, bringing the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia to 1663, including 670 deaths (reported case fatality rate 40.3 percent). Of note is that 4 of the 6 newly confirmed cases are confirmed to be part of the ongoing nosocomial outbreaks, with all 4 cases occurring in patients. Of the 2 remaining cases, one has not been classified other than mentioned as still under investigation, with the other classified as a primary case but high risk exposures are still under investigation. One can't help but wonder if there is some connection to the involved healthcare facilities.Since the beginning of May 2017, there have been a total of 53 laboratory confirmed cases/infections of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Riyadh Saudi Arabia, with 46 of these cases/infections confirmed since 1 Jun 2017. Forty three of the 53 confirmed cases/infections have been identified as healthcare facility acquired, with 28 of these cases occurring in healthcare workers. We await further details on the generations of transmission in each of the ongoing nosocomial outbreaks.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59685>.]
