El Nacional [in Spanish, machine trans., condensed, edited]<http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/salud/difteria-cobro-vida-otra-nina-estado-bolivar_80813>On Sunday morning [12 Feb 2017], the 2nd 10-year-old girl from Pariaguan, Anzoategui state, died in San Felix [Bolivar state] with clinical diagnosis of diphtheria.The girl died of cardiac arrest only hours after having been admitted to intensive care at the health center in Bolivar state, because her illness had already been wreaking havoc on her body for 4 days.Pediatricians reported that her father worked in the mining zone of the state and believe that he could have carried the bacterium which, after 24 years of eradication, has had a rebound in the country since September last year [2016].The girl had only received 2 doses of the pentavalent vaccine that protects against 5 diseases [diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, and Hib (_Haemophilus influenzae_ type b)]. The protocol indicates that 3 doses should be given at 2, 4, and 6 months. Then 2 booster doses with DPT [diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus] vaccine should be applied at 2 and 4 years of age.So far this year [2017], 6 children with clinical diagnosis of diphtheria have been admitted and 2 of them, both from Pariaguan, died. The 1st death, a 9-year-old girl, was reported on 18 Jan 2017.[Byline: Isayen Herrera]--Communicated by:Dr Northan HurtadoDoctors Without BordersDeputy Medical Director<nhurtado@msf.org>[Discussions of diphtheria can be found in ProMED-mail posts Diphtheria - Venezuela: (BO) resurgence 20161002.4530516 and in moderator ML's comments in ProMED post Diphtheria - Norway ex Mozambique: cutaneous, traveler 20140621.2556752.Pariaguan is a municipality in Anzoategui State, one of the 23 states of Venezuela, located in the northeastern region of the country, bordered by the state of Bolivar to the south, where diphtheria had previous been reported by ProMED-mail in 2016 (see also's below) (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzoategui>).Maps of Venezuela can be seen at <http://emapsworld.com/venezuela-provinces-map.html> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/33614>.
