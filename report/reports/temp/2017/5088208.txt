The organization went on to urge the international community to step up efforts to contain the health crisis.Several international organizations -- including the WHO, UNICEF and the Red Cross -- have recently stepped up the delivery of medical supplies to Yemen, where local health authorities have struggled to cope with the outbreak. Local officials say that continued fighting between forces loyal to Yemen's Saudi-backed government -- currently based in the city of Aden -- and the Shia Houthi militia group have frustrated efforts to deal with the crisis.Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when the Houthis and their allies overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa.In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government.[Byline: Ali Oweida]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 728 - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
