UOL Noticias, AgÌ»ncia Fapesp report [in Portuguese, machine trans., edited]<https://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2017/03/13/micose-que-provoca-morte-de-gatos-atinge-humanos-rio-ja-teve-5-mil-casos.htm>A disease that strikes cats and can be transmitted to humans has been spreading throughout the country. Sporotrichosis can cause serious and life-threatening injuries when not treated in a timely manner. The disease is caused by a fungus, _Sporothrix_, which lives naturally in the soil, and is transmitted to other cats, dogs, and owners by means of scratches [as well as direct transmission to humans from soil. - Mod.LL] It is not known why cats are so susceptible to the fungus nor why the disease is so severe in them. A cat with lesions may have fungus in its claws. When fighting with another cat, a dog, or chasing a mouse, it passes the fungus through the nails.Since July 2013, due to the hyperendemic status of sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, the disease has become mandatory reporting in the state. From the INI/Fiocruz [Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation], a reference unit in Rio de Janeiro, more than 5000 human cases and 4703 feline cases were diagnosed by 2015. Just in 2013, according to data from the Sanitary Surveillance of the city of Rio de Janeiro, there were 3253 feline cases. By 2016, there was a 400 percent increase in the number of animals diagnosed. In all, the agency made 13 536 consultations last year [2016] -- whether in public veterinary institutes, in homes, or community care.The Municipal Health Department of Rio de Janeiro registered 580 human cases in 2016. According to veterinarian Isabella Dib GremiÌ£o, of the Laboratory of Clinical Research in Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals of INI/Fiocruz in Brazil, human sporotrichosis is not an officially notifiable disease so its exact prevalence is unknown. GremiÌ£o is the 1st author of a paper that has just been published in the journal PLOS Pathogens on the transmission of sporotrichosis between cats and humans.Biologist Anderson Rodrigues, a professor at Unifesp (Federal University of SÌ£o Paulo), one of the authors of the article, says that it is not known how the fungus began to infect cats. Until the increase in the number of cases in Rio de Janeiro, sporotrichosis was considered a very sporadic disease. According to the researchers, when the animal reaches these conditions, it is common to be abandoned by the owners. In the street, it continues to be transmitted and when buried in a yard or garbage dump, the soil is also infected. According to the researcher, in addition to the ability to diagnose all cases and access to the therapy, combating the outbreak of sporotrichosis requires governments to carry out educational campaigns on responsible animal care.--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Mon 13 Mar 2017 15:24 BRTSource: EstadÌ£o Jornal Digital [in Portuguese, machine trans., edited]<http://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,micose-que-provoca-morte-de-gatos-cresce-400-em-um-ano-no-rio,70001697622>The number of cats affected by sporotrichosis increased 400 percent in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, according to the Sanitary Surveillance department. In addition to felines, humans and dogs can also develop the disease, caused by _Sporothrix_ fungi, with _Sporothrix brasiliensis _ being the most common in Brazil. In all, the city had 13 536 cases reported in cats and 580 in humans only last year [2016].Rarely serious in humans, sporotrichosis can lead to severe lesions in cats, especially the head, progressively attacking the skin, muscles, bones, and even internal organs of the animal, resulting in death. It is spread mainly through the scratch of infected animals, and accentuated by the treatment being expensive and prolonged (at least 6 months). For this reason, most of the cases are concentrated in suburban neighborhoods and poor communities.Until the increase in Rio de Janeiro was identified, cases of this infection were considered sporadic in the country. The reason for the infestation has not yet been identified, although the fungus is normally found in the soil. From 2013 to 2015, only the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (INI/Fiocruz), in the state capital, attended 5000 cases in people and 4703 in cats, while 3253 were reported in 2015. From Rio de Janeiro, the disease would have spread to other cities and states. In the Metropolitan Region of SÌ£o Paulo, 1093 cases have been identified in recent years by UNIFESP [Federal University of SÌ£o Paulo] and the Zoonoses Control Center (CCZ). ""The disease traditionally affected one to 2 people a year, but in 1998 the total number of cases in Rio de Janeiro began to grow,"" said Professor Zoilo Pires de Camargo, head of Unifesp's Laboratory of Medical and Molecular Mycology.According to the researcher, the Carioca epidemic is unique because it involves transmission to humans in expressive numbers. ""In the annals of medicine, the largest outbreak of sporotrichosis occurred in the 1940s among miners in South Africa. The origin of the infection in the 3000 reported cases was in the support woodwork of the mine galleries, where there were colonies of _Sporothrix_. Once the foci of infection were identified, the wood was treated and the epidemic was over,"" said Camargo--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[The reference for the PLOS Pathogens journal article mentioned in [1] above isGremiÌ£o IDF, Miranda LHM, Reis EG, Rodrigues AM, et al: Epidemic of Sporotrichosis: cat to human transmission. PLoS Pathog 2017; 13(1): e1006077; available at <http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006077>.""Introduction-------------Most of the 51 species embedded in the genus _Sporothrix_ are nonpathogenic environmental fungi that are closely related to decaying wood, plants, and soil. However, members of the _Sporothrix schenckii_ complex are highly successful mammal pathogens, including _S. brasiliensis_, _S. schenckii_ sensu stricto (s. str.), _S. globosa_, and _S. luriei_, the causative agents of human and animal sporotrichosis. Their key to success during mammal infection lies at least in part with their ability to change from a mycelial saprophytic lifestyle at 25 deg C [77 deg F] in the environment to a parasitic yeast cell at an elevated temperature (35-37 deg C [95-98.6 deg F]), such as those developed by warm-blooded hosts.Typically, infection develops after traumatic inoculation of contaminated soil, plants, and organic matter into skin or mucosa. Alternatively, infection may occur during the animal transmission (cat-cat or cat-dog) and zoonotic transmission (cat-human), which has been mostly associated with scratches or bites from infected cats. In Brazil, _S. brasiliensis_ is repeatedly associated with feline infection and has consistently shown higher virulence during epizootics, as well as in murine models of sporotrichosis. A hallmark of _S. brasiliensis_ infection is its tendency to escalate to outbreaks or epidemics among cats with high potential for zoonotic transmission.Sporotrichosis is an emergent disease and, over the past 2 decades, the incidence of zoonotic sporotrichosis has been on the rise, particularly in Brazil. Judging from the epizootic and zoonotic epidemics taking place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, tackling sporotrichosis requires the engagement of animal and human health policies to reduce the transmission chain of _Sporothrix_."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54625>.]
