Santa Cruz Patch [edited]<https://patch.com/california/santacruz/hepatitis-outbreak-santa-cruz-co-linked-socal-strain-killed-4>In the last 8 weeks, 9 homeless people in their 20s and 30s in Santa Cruz [County, California] have been diagnosed with hepatitis A, constituting an outbreak of the same strain that recently killed 4 people in the San Diego area, Santa Cruz County health officials said [Tue 13 Jun 2017]. Santa Cruz County public health officer Arnold Leff believes the outbreak is connected with a larger one that started in San Diego County in 2016. In November 2016, 2 people were diagnosed with the disease in San Diego County, but as of [Mon 12 Jun 2017], that number had climbed to 160, including 4 deaths and 80 percent of those infected having been hospitalized, Leff said.Normally, Santa Cruz County health officials only see 1 or 2 cases per year. Since April 2017, 5 men aged 25 to 36 and 4 women aged 26 to 30 have been diagnosed. All are unsheltered other than one man who is staying with his mother, Leff said. ""It's close to being defined as an epidemic, but for now we're calling it an outbreak,"" Leff said.Leff said smaller outbreaks had been reported in Plumas County and in Arizona and New York, but that he had no evidence to believe those outbreaks were related. ""When we first got our 1st 2 cases, we did not wait,"" Leff said. ""We started a hepatitis A vaccination program targeted to the most at-risk individuals in hopes of preventing a large-scale outbreak similar to what they have in San Diego.""The people most at risk of catching hepatitis A are homeless, drug users, men who have sex with men, people with clotting factor disorders, those who live with or care for hepatitis A patients, and anyone traveling to countries with moderate to high rates of hepatitis A.""Given the 4 deaths they had and the obvious increase in cases in San Diego, we made an aggressive decision to open up our operation center and to treat this outbreak, even though it was initially small, as an urgent outbreak that we needed to respond to,"" Leff said.""There's no treatment for hepatitis A. Most people do generally pretty well, in the sense that the mortality rate in the average person is only about 3 per 1000,"" Leff said. ""However, anybody with liver disease has a mortality rate that's 10 times higher than that."" For example, people who already have hepatitis C when they are diagnosed with hepatitis A have a mortality rate of 2.5 or 3 per 100, Leff said.Free vaccinations are being offered to those most at risk for contracting hepatitis A, including drug users and the homeless, at the Santa Cruz Health Center at 1080 Emeline Ave and the Watsonville Health Center at 9 Crestview Drive. ""They are at the most risk of serious consequences if they get Hepatitis A, so we have started a major vaccination program,"" Leff said. ""We're not vaccinating everybody.""Vaccinations are also available at the Planned Parenthood clinics in Santa Cruz and Watsonville, the Dominican Pediatric Clinic and Women's Health Center in Santa Cruz and Clinica del Valle del Pajaro and Salud Para la Gente in Watsonville.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The San Diego HAV has been reported as IB and apparently the Santa Cruz strains are IB as well. Both being IB does not definitively link the isolates without more analysis.A short discussion of the virus is shown below extracted from Desbois D, Couturier E, Mackiewicz V, et al: Epidemiology and genetic characterization of hepatitis A virus genotype IIA. J Clin Microbiol 2010; 48(9); 3306-15; doi: 10.1128/JCM.00667-10; <http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/9/3306.long>. The citations can be found at the original URL:Despite significant genetic variability, a single serotype has been described (13). Sequence variation of a 168-nucleotide fragment encompassing the VP1/2A junction has initially defined seven genotypes that differ by at least 15 percent and subtypes that differ by 7.0 to 7.5 percent (19). 6 HAV genotypes (genotypes I to VI) are now defined based on analysis of the 900 nucleotides of the complete VP1 protein (6). Genotypes I, II, and III, divided into subtypes A and B, infect humans. The former genotype VII has been reclassified within the genotype II clade as subgenotype IIB (6, 14). Data on genotype distribution showed that genotype I was the most prevalent worldwide, with IA being reported more frequently than IB, and that subgenotype IIIA was prevalent in Central Asia (6, 16, 19). In areas of low endemicity, such as the United States and Western Europe, subgenotype IA dominates, but all genotypes and subtypes have been reported (6, 16, 23). Most HAV strains in these countries can be identified as imported strains by phylogenetic analysis thanks to growing sequence databases, which allow for the tracing of the geographic origin of a given subgenotype (16).No information is found regarding cases in Plumas County, California, which is located on the eastern edge of California, northeast of the coastal Santa Cruz County. More information is needed bout cases in Plumas County - Mod.LLThe state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4262>.

The cases are adult males aged 32-57, none with a history of travel or other apparent hepatitis A exposure. Illness onset dates ranged from 2-26 May 2017. A common source for these infections has not been identified; Orange County Public Health is investigating the situation.15-25 cases of hepatitis A infection have been reported annually in Orange County from 2011-16, the vast majority following exposure either during international travel or to a known case of hepatitis A.Of note, San Diego County has had 160 cases of hepatitis A, including 4 deaths, reported since early 2017, primarily in homeless and/or illicit drug user populations. None of the recently-identified Orange County cases have a history of these risk factors or connection to San Diego's outbreak, but it is possible that our County may have cases of hepatitis A associated with this event. Additional information on the San Diego outbreak can be found at <http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/Hepatitis_A.html>.The FDA also recently announced a national recall of frozen tuna potentially contaminated with hepatitis A which was served in several restaurants in Southern California, including Orange County. No cases of hepatitis A have been identified thus far in association with this event in Orange County or elsewhere. The complete recall advisory can be found at <https://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Outbreaks/ucm561199.htm>.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The Orange County cases do not appear to have the same epidemiologic co-factors that are reported from San Diego and Santa Cruz counties. The recent recall of HAV potentially contaminated tuna could be related to the Orange County cases but, to date, there is no direct evidence to support this.ProMED-mail would like more information in this regard and about clusters in other California counties and elsewhere. - Mod.LL]
