According to 'El Mercurio' (one of the main Chilean newspapers), there are 74 affected persons, who may have acquired the disease because of purchasing and consuming food from street vendors.In recent times, there has been a significant increase in arepas (sort of cornmeal rolls), pizzas and grilled beef, amongst other products, being freely sold in the streets. In this respect, Ms Lila Vergara, a local Health Officer, declared that ""our hypothesis is that (the cause of the viral hepatitis A outbreak) is food consumption from unauthorized places, such as purchasing this stuff from street vendors"".--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Antofagasta (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antofagasta>) is a port city in northern Chile, about 1100 kilometers (700 mi) north of Santiago.
