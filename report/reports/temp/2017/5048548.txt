Pulse News Agency International [edited]<http://pulse.com.gh/health/meningitis-outbreak-caused-almost-180-deaths-in-niger-since-january-id6694385.html>At least 179 people, almost half of them children, have died of meningitis since January [2017] in Niger, where some 3000 suspected cases have been reported, the United Nations said [Wed 17 May 2017]. ""From [2 Jan to 7 May 2017], a total of 3037 suspected cases of meningitis, including 179 deaths, was reported in the country,"" said the UN's humanitarian agency, OCHA. ""The fatality rate is 5.9 percent.""Meningitis is caused by different types of bacteria, 6 of which can cause epidemics. It is transmitted between people by coughing and sneezing, close contact and cramped living conditions. The illness causes acute inflammation of the outer layers of the brain and spinal cord, with the most common symptoms being fever, headache, and neck stiffness.The UN agency had previously reported 120 deaths out of 2102 suspected meningitis cases at the end of April [2017]. 45 percent of the total cases were of children between 5 and 14.Niger however has not been the worst affected African country this year [2017]. Last week [week of 8 May 2017], the Centre for Disease Control announced that Nigeria -- Niger's neighbour to the south -- had recorded a total of 13 420 suspected cases in 23 states, with 1069 deaths.Both countries lie in the so-called ""meningitis belt"" of sub-Saharan Africa which stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, where outbreaks of the disease are a regular occurrence.Niger's outbreak has been concentrated in the south and western parts of the country, but OCHA saw a drop in the number of cases beginning in April [2017]. The town of Madarounfa, south of Maradi, is still experiencing an outbreak and Niamey remains on alert.The UN, along with medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and other organisations, launched mass vaccination programmes in the affected areas, including Niamey. Nigerian health minister Idi Illiassou Mainassara had said in April [2017] that Niger has enough medicine to treat up to 25 000 people. The country went through a similar outbreak between January and June last year [2016], when health authorities recorded 573 deaths and more than 8500 cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur George A Robertson[Maps of Niger can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Niger.gif> and < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58 >. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2]Date: Thu 18 May 2017Source: Sahel-Intelligence [in French, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://sahel-intelligence.com/10054-niger-lepidemie-de-meningite-fait-plusieurs-dizaines-de-morts.html>Niger is facing a severe epidemic of meningitis, which has raged since last January [2017] and killed nearly 180 people, according to the UN Office of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Niamey.Children aged 5 to 14 constitute 45 percent of the total number of deaths. The epidemic killed ""179 people, from [2 Jan to 7 May 2017], from a total of 3037 suspected cases of meningitis, a case fatality rate of 5.9 percent,"" said OCHA Niamey.Last April [2017], the Ministry of Health launched a major vaccination campaign to try to contain the epidemic. Nearly 100 000 people, [aged from] from 0 to 20, are concerned.The health authorities of the country also have medicines to treat about 25 000 patients, said the Minister of Health, Idi Illiassou.The capital Niamey is among the most affected. Between the beginning of January and the end of March [2017], 90 cases of meningitis, including 4 deaths were recorded in certain districts of the main city of the country.At the end of last April [2017], the UN had reported 120 deaths out of the 2102 meningitis sufferers registered across the country.This is not the 1st time that Niger has faced a meningitis epidemic of this magnitude. In 2015, a similar epidemic had spread to countries, leaving 577 deaths in more than 8589 cases between January and June.[Byline: FrÌ©dÌ©ric Powelton]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Historically, the usual pathogen causing most bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt, which includes Niger, has been _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A (<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf>). However, the epidemiology of meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt changed after preventive vaccination of the population with conjugate meningitis A vaccine -- MenAfrivac (R) -- was introduced in 2010. Serogroup A meningococcus has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and other bacterial species, including _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus pneumoniae_ (<http://bit.ly/2rAxx5Y> and <http://bit.ly/2r0UOlp>)._S. pneumoniae_ serotype 1 from a single clonal complex (ST 217) has predominated in several outbreaks, but other pneumococcal serotypes are also isolated. The case-fatality rate for pneumococcal meningitis has been high; over 40 percent of cases are fatal, regardless of age group.The news report above does not say which organism is causing the current outbreak. However a news report from 21 Apr 2017 said that this Niger outbreak was due to meningococcus serogroup C (<http://reliefweb.int/report/niger/niger-meningitis-epidemic-outbreak-mdrne017-emergency-plan-action-epoa>) and ProMED-mail reported in August 2015 that serogroup C caused an outbreak in Niger in 2015 (see archive no. 20150802.3552463). Identifying the specific microbial causes of a bacterial meningitis outbreak is critically important, because vaccines used to control an outbreak must cover the organism causing the outbreak. - Mod.ML]
