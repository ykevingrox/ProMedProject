Fox News, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/30/brazil-confirms-more-yellow-fever-cases-over-100-infected.html>The vast majority of [yellow fever] cases are in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, where authorities had confirmed 97 cases as of [Fri 27 Jan 2017]. Of those, 40 died.The Health Department of SÌ£o Paulo on [Mon 30 Jan 2017] said it has now confirmed 6 cases of the disease, 4 of whom became infected in Minas Gerais. All of the patients died.Much of Brazil is considered at risk for yellow fever, but the country has not seen this large an outbreak since 2000. The World Health Organization has said it expects the mosquito-borne to spread to more states.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The numbers of cases in Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo states have increased a bit sine the previous report. Presumably, all the cases, including the new ones, are due to spill-over of the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TY]******[2] EspÌ rito Santo: monkey fatalitiesDate: Tue 31 Jan 2017Source: Yahoo News, Reuters report [edited]<https://www.yahoo.com/news/yellow-fever-taking-heavy-toll-monkeys-brazils-rainforest-204014213.html>The worst yellow fever [YF] outbreak in decades is not just killing Brazilians, it threatens to wipe out monkeys in the Atlantic rainforest that are already close to extinction, experts warned on [Tue 31 Jan 2017].So far, 400 monkeys have been found dead in the state of Espirito Santo where the fever outbreak has spread from neighboring Minas Gerais.At greatest risk is the muriqui monkey, Brazil's largest primate and one of the planet's 25 most-endangered species of primates, said biologist Roberto Cabral at the Brazilian environmental agency Ibama.""The monkeys are vulnerable to yellow fever just like humans but we have vaccines to protect us; they don't,"" Cabral said. ""They are being decimated.""Farmers first alerted authorities about the dying animals when they realized that the forest had gone silent and the monkeys had disappeared.Yellow fever is a viral disease found in tropical regions of Africa and the Americas, that mainly affects humans and monkeys and is transmitted by the same type of mosquito that spreads dengue and the Zika virus. [The same mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_ transmits YF virus among humans in the urban cycle in South America and Africa. It also transmits dengue and Zika viruses among humans. However, in the South American tropics, different mosquitoes, _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ species, transmit YF virus in the sylvan (forest) cycle among monkeys with spill-over to humans as is the case with this outbreak in Brazil. - Mod.TY]Public health officials have confirmed the death of 46 humans from yellow fever in rural areas and are urging people to get vaccinated in 9 states where the disease is present to prevent the outbreak from becoming an epidemic. Most of the cases were reported in Minas Gerais state.Ibama has received reports of rural inhabitants killing monkeys out of the erroneous belief that they can transmit yellow fever to humans. ""Some people are blaming the monkeys, which is absurd, because the mosquitoes are the villains,"" said Cabral. ""The monkeys are helping us humans by alerting us to the presence of yellow fever.""[Byline: Anthony Boadle; editing: Tom Brown]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There are 2 species of muriqui monkey in Brazil -- the northern muriqui (_Brachyteles hypoxanthus_) that has been on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Critically Endangered list for more than 25 years and the southern muriqui (_Brachyteles arachnoides_) that has been placed on that list more recently. The concern about significant mortality of these endangered spider monkeys affecting their survival is real. Unfortunately, there is no feasible way to prevent them from becoming infected with YF virus in the forest. - Mod.TY]
