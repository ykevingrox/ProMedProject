Recently, the Arkansas Department of Health [ADH] determined that 2 cases of tick-borne disease met the surveillance definition for Lyme disease. A case in Arkansas has not met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) surveillance definition since 2007.Arkansas is considered a low-incidence state for Lyme cases by the CDC. Arkansas is in the low-incidence category based on geographical patterns of disease in the US, as well as past reports of the disease in the state. Arkansas is among the group of 31 states where the incidence of Lyme disease has been less than 1 in 100 000 persons from 2005-2014 and among 15 states where the incidence has been under one case per million persons in the same timeframe.In comparison, Arkansas reports a high number of cases of other tick-borne diseases, including tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and ehrlichiosis, all of which can be fatal. These diseases are more prevalent in Arkansas than in most other states.""Recognizing these 2 cases is consistent with Arkansas's designation as a low-incidence state for Lyme disease,"" said Dirk Haselow, state epidemiologist at ADH. ""We know that Lyme is rare here, and we encourage doctors and patients to consider other diagnoses first. However, we are committed to finding cases of Lyme when they do occur. If a test for Lyme is done, it is important for the testing to be done correctly to meet the case definition. Doctors and patients can learn about proper testing and reporting for suspected Lyme cases on our website.""Following the clinical diagnosis of Lyme by a health care provider, the patient should consult with their physician or an infectious disease specialist to determine if treatment is needed. The Arkansas Department of Health follows the CDC guidelines for reporting confirmed cases. Limitations in testing do sometimes lead to false positives or cases that are missed. Arkansas patients who have traveled in states where Lyme is prevalent, such as Northeastern and Midwestern states, are the most commonly diagnosed cases.ADH conducts a variety of activities to assess Lyme disease activity in Arkansas, including research partnerships with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, and the CDC. ADH posts reports of tick-associated diseases publically to the agency website and conducts numerous educational activities on tick associated diseases in Arkansas.People can protect themselves from tick-borne disease by preventing tick bites. Avoid wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, walk in the center of trails, and use repellents that contain 20-30 percent DEET to help avoid direct contact with ticks.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the US, the incidence of Lyme disease is highly concentrated in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central states, where the incidence rates varied from 14.4 to 70.5/100 000 in 2014, in contrast to the southeastern states, where the incidence rates were less than 1/100 000 in 2014 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>). A map of the US showing the distribution of Lyme disease cases can be found at (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html>).Multiple reasons might explain these differences in regional Lyme disease incidence, including a truly greater number of infections, associated with greater densities and biting propensity of _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected _Ixodes_ ticks and greater encroachment of human development into tick-infested rural and suburban areas, but also possibly enhanced surveillance, increased awareness among health-care professionals and the public in the high incidence states.In addition, the occurrence of southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), a condition that can resemble early Lyme disease clinically, but is not thought to be caused by _B. burgdorferi_, complicates Lyme disease surveillance in southeastern US. However, in 2014 the number of confirmed Lyme disease cases in the southeastern state of Alabama went from 13 in 2012 and 11 in 2013 to 28 in 2014 and the incidence rates from 0.3 and 0.2 to 0.6/100 000, respectively (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>).Another reason postulated for regional differences is the geographic variation in _Borrelia_ species causing Lyme disease. Molecular evidence has implicated _B. americana_ and _B, andersonii_ in cases in the southeast, _B. bissettii_ in California, and _B. mayonii_ in the north-central region (<http://jmm.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.073122-0#tab2>, <http://www.reuters.com/article/health-lyme-idUSL2N15N1T2>, and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675506/>).Genetic differences between species within the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex may result in problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208>.]
