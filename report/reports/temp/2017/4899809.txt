Emergency medical services [EMS] staff had to work through the night after a mass outbreak of suspected food poisoning at the centre affected almost 60 residents and employees.Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo confirmed late yesterday afternoon [13 Mar 2017] that one person -- a 72-year-old woman -- had died of food poisoning.The centre was one of the places identified as a new home for patients from Algoa Frail Care and Lorraine Frail Care [Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape], when the Department of Social Development said it was closing the only 2 fully state-funded frail care centres in Port Elizabeth later in 2017.EMS Nelson Mandela Bay manager Brenhan Metune said their call centre had received a call at 2.30 am yesterday [14 Mar 2017] from one of the nurses on duty. ""There were 59 patients who were vomiting and suffering from abdominal cramps,"" he said. 5 of the patients were employees at the centre. Metune said due to the large number, the patients were divided between the accident and emergency units at Livingstone and Dora Nginza hospitals.""It is understood that chicken that was prepared, fried, and cooked on [Sat 11 Mar 2017] was rewarmed on [Sun 12 Mar 2017], for lunch. ""The symptoms developed during the night,"" he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[If the symptoms began after midnight and the lunch was the preceding noon, an incubation period of more than 12 hours makes staphylococcal foodborne illness less likely. It would be important to know if fever was present, if diarrhea was also a symptom, and how long the illness lasted. - Mod.LLMaps of South Africa can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/south_africa_prov_map2.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/611>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
