WHO Bulletin on outbreaks and other emergencies [edited]<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/255624/1/OEW22-270262017.pdf?ua=1>Ebola DRC: 7 cases, 4 deaths, 57 percent CFR--------------------------WHO, UN Agencies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and partners continue to support the Ministry of Health in the DRC to investigate and respond to the outbreak of EVD confined to Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province in the northeast of the country.Two cases have been confirmed as positive for EVD by serology this week [27 May-2 Jun 2017]. These 2 cases were previously reported as suspected cases and are part of known transmission chains. Their contacts have been followed up. The date of the last confirmed case reported remains as 11 May 2017. Since the beginning of the outbreak on 21 Apr 2017, 4 confirmed and 3 probable cases have been reported, of which 4 have died (case fatality rate, CFR: 57 percent). Enhanced surveillance activities are ongoing in affected communities, and new suspected cases continue to be reported and screened. Predictive modelling suggests there is a low and decreasing probability of further cases; however, it is critical to remain vigilant.Concurrently, differential diagnoses and laboratory investigations are ongoing into the causes of illness in persons who remain sick but have tested negative for EVD, and into the unusually high mortality in the local swine population in 8 villages in the Nambwa Health Area.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall
