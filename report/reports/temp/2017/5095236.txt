EpiCore Surveillance ProjectLocal (Atlanta, GA) news has reported several overdose cases of the use opiod products ""laced"" with fentanyl. WSB Channel News reported this week [week of 4-10 Jun 2017] that yellow pills stamped with the name ""Percoset"" on them were actually fentanyl pills; these pills led to at least one death. This video clip from WSB Channel 2 news contains more information on this issue. <http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/1-day-1-county-3-overdoses-1-death-is-fentanyl-in-forsyth-county/515616312>--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project[ProMED-mail would like to thank our EpiCore Surveillance Project member for alerting us almost immediately after receipt of a request for further information, on the fentanyl component of these pills. - Mod.MPP]******[2]Date: Thu 8 Jun 2017Source: Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) [edited]<https://gbi.georgia.gov/press-releases/2017-06-08/gbi-crime-lab-testing-overdoses-related-counterfeit-pills>On [Wed 7 June 2017], the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's Crime Lab received evidence related to the reported overdoses in the Central Georgia area. Preliminary results indicate a mixture of 2 synthetic opioids, with one of the drugs being consistent with a new fentanyl analogue. This fentanyl analogue has not previously been identified by the GBI Crime Lab. Due to the nature of the analysis, testing to confirm the full identity of the drug will require additional time. The GBI Crime Laboratory continues to make the analysis a priority.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Department of Public Health, Georgia Poison Center, hospitals, local, state, and federal partners are working jointly on this investigation.

There are some reports in the news of this drug being imported from East Asia (I believe it may have 1st surface in Ohio?). Carfentanil is 10 000 times more potent than morphine (100 times more potent than fentanyl). The DEA also released the following statement regarding a rise in carfentanil overdoses/exposures dating back to Sep 2016: <https://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2016/hq092216.shtml>If this ultimately is what ends up being identified in the drug analysis, my best suggestion is to contact the local zoo veterinarian, as these drugs have long been used in zoos by veterinarians and intensive and detailed protocols have been written at all institutions using the drug to help guide those who may need to respond to a potential human exposure. The biggest risk in these exposures is re-narcotization, which might explain why the large doses of naloxone were needed. I look forward to hearing the results of the testing; please feel free to email with any questions.--Katherine Fogelberg University of Tennessee health sciences center<Katherine.Fogelberg@unthsc.edu>******[4]Date: Thu 8 Jun 2017From: Ken Waldrup, DVM[email address withheld by request]In the northern states, they have been having problems with heroin laced with a carfentanil derivative. The legal carfentanil drug is approximately 700 times more potent than heroin so naloxone has a difficult time reversing such a potent opioid. In dealing with large ungulates immobilized with carfentanil, veterinarians learned that naloxone couldn't cut it 30 years ago. Naltrexone is the reversal agent of choice with veterinary use of carfentanil.--Ken Waldrup DVM[email withheld on request]******[5]Date: Jun 9, 2017 2:33 PMFrom: ""Powell, Ryan"" <RPowell@rdn.bc.ca>Re: Drug Abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance,	RFI The article ""Drug Abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance, RFI"" resonated with me because of the fentanyl crisis occurring in British Columbia, Canada.  The reaction to the drugs after use, and the necessity of naloxone for counteraction sounds very similar to the effects of fentanyl and it will be interesting to hear if that is what the substance is identified as.  <http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/fentanyl-continues-to-drive-b-c-overdose-spike> -- Ryan PowellLaboratory Technician Greater Nanaimo Pollution Control CentreRegional District of Nanaimo <rpowell@rdn.bc.ca>[A total of 2 individuals have mentioned carfentanil. Indeed, this drug does seem to more closely resemble the situation reported in the original release. On the other hand, the lab believes it has found what is a fentanyl analogue. Carfentanil has a relationship to fentanyl and could be described as a fentanyl analogue, or perhaps the lab has not considered veterinary drugs, especially since carfentanil is not appropriate for human dosages. However, I would be skeptical that the lab is not aware of carfentanil.The lab has mentioned the product is a fentanyl analogue so it seems unlikely that it would just be fentanyl as described in the article/video from Canada. Although, perhaps lab wanted to double check and used this as a way to buy some time. I would be surprised if that was the case, but knowing the need for laboratory correctness and the political sensitivity of this, it could be possible. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/213>.]
