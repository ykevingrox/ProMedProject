The cases have been reported mainly in eastern border provinces, where livestock [is] illegally smuggled into the country.Since 2000, at least 988 cases of Crimean-Congo fever have been reported in Iran, according to the Iranian officials.Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia. The virus is a member of the Bunyaviridae family of RNA viruses.It is a disease carried by several domestic and wild animals. While clinical disease is rare in infected animals, it is severe in infected humans, with a mortality rate of 10 to 40 percent.[Byline Fatih Karimov]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The report attributes CCHF cases to illegal livestock trade in to the country. However, the presence of the CCHF virus has been demonstrated in ticks in Iran as early as 1978, when the CCHFV was isolated for the 1st time from the Ornithodoros tick _Alveonasus lahorensis_in the north eastern region of Iran [Sureau P, Klein JM, Casals J, Digoutte JOP, Salaun JJ, Piazak N, et al. Isolation of Thogoto, Wad medani, Wanowrie, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses from ticks of domestic animals in Iran. Ann Virol (Inst Pasteur) 1980;131E:185-200]. Later in 2002 the CCHFV genome was detected in 22.3 percent of ticks collected from Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiari province, in the southwest of Iran. The control of tick infestation in the endemic regions would be an important public health measure to control the emergence of new cases. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/128>.]
