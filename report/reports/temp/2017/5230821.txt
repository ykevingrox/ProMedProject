The district said that 3 adult yellow fever mosquitoes, known as _Aedes aegypti_, were collected from Corcoran. The mosquito species is capable of transmitting yellow fever, dengue fever and the Zika and chikungunya viruses.The Kings Mosquito Abatement District recommends that Corcoran residents prevent mosquito breeding by ensuring that pools and spas are properly maintained and emptying containers to get rid of any standing water. The district also suggests using screens on doors and windows and using insect repellent with effective ingredients such as Deet, Picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus.Michael Cavanagh, district manager of the Kings Mosquito Abatement District, said that ""because this mosquito prefers to breed in small containers, it is very difficult to control with traditional mosquito control techniques. Residents are encouraged to contact the district if they experience mosquitoes biting during the day and indoors.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in Kings county, California. Finding _Aedes aegypti_ in this county is not surprising. Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 13 years (see archives listed below). Both of them have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1-3 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya or dengue virus transmission. Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of these viruses into southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4364>.
