Oregonlive [edited]<http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2017/03/osu_student_receiving_treatmen.html>An Oregon State University student being treated for meningitis is the 3rd to come down with the disease in the past 4 months.The university and Benton County announced Thursday [2 Mar 2017] that an undergraduate student is being treated for the B strain of meningococcal disease at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Corvallis. The student is in good condition, officials said.University spokesman Steve Clark said school officials think the case is unrelated to the November 2016 cases, which weren't related to one another.County officials have identified people who had close personal contact with the student before he or she was taken to the hospital, Clark said. They were treated with a preventative medicine and didn't exhibit any signs of meningitis, as far as officials know.Officials recommend all undergraduate students under 25 years old get vaccinated, per Centers for Control and Prevention advice. Clark especially urged students 25 and younger who live in congregate housing -- such as residence halls, Greek houses and private co-ops -- to get vaccinated.Officials also urge people under 25 who visit such housing to get vaccinated.Clark said about 5000 students live in student housing. As many as 2000 more students 25 and younger live in off-campus congregate housing, he said.The university will host vaccination clinics at its McAlexander Fieldhouse next Wednesday and Thursday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The clinics target students who are 25 and younger and live in congregate housing, Clark said, but the university won't turn anyone away.""We understand that news of this matter is concerning for our students and their families,"" he said in a statement. ""While this is a serious matter, it is not emergency.""Oregon children have not been routinely vaccinated against type B, the most common form of the disease in the state, causing an outbreak at the University of Oregon in 2015 and infecting the 2 students at OSU this past November [2016].Symptoms include fever, headache, weakness and rash. The bacteria can spread, inflaming tissue in the brain and around the spine. It's imperative to get quick treatment with antibiotics. The disease can be deadly. Between 2003 and 2007 in the United States, 500 people among 4100 died from meningitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The infection is spread by coughing and sneezing, sharing drinking, eating and smoking utensils, and intimate activity, officials said.Oregon Senate Bill 274, which would require colleges and universities that provide student housing to give enrolling students information about vaccine-preventable diseases known to affect people between 16 and 21 years old, was introduced in January [2017]. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Education later that month.[Byline: Jim Ryan]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 3 Mar 2017Source: KATU News [edited]<http://katu.com/news/local/3rd-osu-student-hit-with-meningococcal-disease>The same strain of [_Neisseria meningitidis_, the bacterium that causes] meningococcal disease that infected 2 Oregon State University students last fall has sickened another student.The Gazette-Times reports the student has been hospitalized in Corvallis since 23 Feb [2017] and is in good condition. The [2] students admitted to hospital for the same disease in November [2016] were later released.Charlie Fautin is the deputy director of the Benton County Health Department. He says health workers have identified 43 people who may have been exposed to the infected student and have treated them with antibiotics.The Benton County Health Department also tells KATU News that they are now considering this an outbreak.[Byline: Joe Douglass]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Serogroups B, C, and Y are the major causes of meningococcal disease in the United States, each being responsible for about 1/3rd of cases (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>). In infants aged under one year, over 50 per cent of cases are caused by serogroup B, and in people over 11 years of age, 75 per cent are caused by serogroups (C, Y, or W). Serogroup B meningococci have also been responsible for several outbreaks and isolated cases on US college campuses in the last 5 years (<http://www.nfid.org/idinfo/meningococcal/meningococcal-b-college-outbreaks.html>).In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 OSU [Oregon State University] students in Corvallis were diagnosed with meningococcal disease due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B. According to the 1st news report above, meningococcus serogroup B was also isolated from a 3rd case of meningococcal meningitis on the Corvallis campus of OSU. The ""same strain"" mentioned in the 2nd news report could mean that perhaps genotyping had been done that would indicate all 3 isolates are closely related genetically. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.The CDC defines an outbreak of meningococcal disease as the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons, which is approximately 10-fold greater than the normal occurrence <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.Oregon State University (OSU) is a coeducational, public university; the main campus is located in the city of Corvallis in the Willamette Valley of the US state of Oregon (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University#Main_campus_.28Corvallis.29>). The university has a total student enrollment of 30 354, the largest among all Oregon universities.In 2015, ProMED-mail reported that 6 cases of invasive serogroup B meningococcal disease occurred in students at the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon between 13 Jan 2015 and 19 Mar 2015 (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) fatal, college, sg. B, sg. B vaccine 20150531.3398946). Eugene is 47 miles (75.6 km) south of Corvallis.A 7th case associated with the University of Oregon occurred in a father of a student who visited the campus in May 2015. Presumably, if he was infected with the outbreak strain, he must have had contact with someone on campus who was a persistent asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier over a month after the last student case. Five of the 6 student cases, including a case who died, had bloodstream meningococcal infections. At the time, the University of Oregon offered meningococcal serogroup B vaccination to the students.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20733>. - Mod.ML]
