The isolation of the WPV1 in environmental samples confirms this. In the most recent isolations in Afghanistan, there is also an early report of a new WPV1 associated case in Nangarhar province, but from a different district (Batikot) than the where the environmental isolates were from (Jalalabad and Besud). Of note is that the 3 districts (Batikot, Jalalabad and Besud) are contiguous with one another. Nangarhar province borders with Pakistan (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province#/media/File:Map_Nangarhar_Province.svg>).In contrast, the positive environmental samples in Pakistan are coming from Sindh province (Sukkur and Karachi districts). (<http://www.mappk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sindh-Province-Complete-Map-District-Wise.jpg>). The most recent case of WPV1 paralytic disease in Sindh had onset of paralysis on [Fri 11 Aug 2017] and was in Karachi. Of note is that in recent updates, there have been other positive environmental samples for WPV1 in Sindh province, involving multiple different districts. (see Poliomyelitis update (26): global (Syria, DR Congo) 20170922.5334914, Poliomyelitis update (27): global (Pakistan, Afghanistan), Syria 20170928.5347795). - The cVDPV2 is still circulating in Syria, predominantly in Mayadeen, Deir Ez-Zor governorate where one new case was confirmed, and 2 asymptomatic children also had cVDPV infections.A map showing the global distribution of all WPV1 associated cases and cVDPV associated cases can be found at <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at:Pakistan: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140>.Afghanistan: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/137>Syria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>. - Mod.MPP]
