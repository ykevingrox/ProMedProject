Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/washington-mumps-outbreak-least-387-cases-36529/>The Spokane Regional Health District reported 152 cases of mumps in Spokane County as of [Sun 5 Feb 2017], with several more under investigation, therefore, the number is expected to grow in coming days.In King County, the number of current cases in the county stands at 179 (72 confirmed, 107 probable), with 61.5 percent reported as up-to-date on MMR vaccine.As of [Tud 7 Feb 2017] 44 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in Pierce County.These and 5 other Washington counties that are reported mumps cases in the single digits puts the state's mumps outbreak to at least 387 as of this writing.Mumps is caused by a virus. It is usually rare in the United States because most people have received immunizations to protect them against mumps. People born before 1957 are probably immune to mumps because most people had the disease before the immunizations were routinely given starting in the early 1970s.Mumps is spread by close face-to-face contact with a person who has the infection.Mumps is best known for the puffy cheeks and swollen jaw that it causes. This is a result of swollen salivary glands.The most common symptoms include: - Fever - Headache - Muscle Aches - Tiredness - Loss of Appetite - Swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one of both sides (parotitis).Symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease.A person with mumps should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after the start of the swollen glands because the person is contagious during this time. People who have mumps should not go to work or school, and stay home while they are contagious (5 days after the onset of gland swelling).The MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. People who have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are about 9 times less likely to get mumps than unvaccinated people who have the same exposure to mumps virus. However, some people who receive 2 doses of MMR can still get mumps, especially if they have prolonged, close contact with someone who has the disease, and it has been several years since they were vaccinated. If a vaccinated person does get mumps, they will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person.Before there was a vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease in the United States. In some cases, the disease caused complications, such as permanent deafness in children and, occasionally, swelling of the brain (encephalitis), which in rare cases caused death. From year to year, the number of mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. In some years, there are more cases of mumps than usual because of outbreaks.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>2016-2017 Washington State Emerging Mumps Outbreak[According to preliminary data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of infectious mumps cases in the United States is at a 10-year high. As of 3 Dec 2016, 4258 cases of mumps have been reported across 45 states and the District of Columbia - more than twice the number of mumps cases reported in 2015. Most of these cases are linked to a number of schools and college campuses who are reporting a surge in outbreak activity. As of 5 Jan 2017, Washington State is reporting a total of 151 cases of infectious mumps outbreaks (55 confirmed and 96 probable) in King, Pierce, Snohomish, Spokane, and Yakima counties.Excerpted from <http://www.samishtribe.nsn.us/2016-2017-washington-state-emerging-mumps-outbreak/>][Note the case number appears to have more than doubled in the last month [January 2017], but this could be a reporting artifact. - Mod.LK][The state of Washington can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248.

Cases were also reported in Wellington (2), Canterbury (1) and the West Coast (1).The Ministry of Health said it appeared most of the cases had been acquired overseas, and had affected people between the ages of 2 and 31.There was an increased risk of further outbreaks so people should check they were immunized, the ministry said.Deputy director of public health Harriett Carr said the rise in mumps cases usually stemmed from people not being immunized.""With these 20 cases among children and young adults, we think most have come from Fiji where there is a mumps outbreak at the moment,"" she said.""There's always a chance people will pick up an illness and bring it back here when they're travelling, so the best thing we can do is make sure we have good immunization rates and that people are aware of the symptoms of these illnesses.""Symptoms of the viral illness include sore and swollen areas under the jaw, usually accompanied or preceded by fever, muscle soreness, poor appetite, and fatigue.Many people were unaware that mumps could be a serious illness, Dr Carr said. About 1 in 10 people get meningitis and there are other, rarer serious consequences.The start of the school year heightened the possibility of further cases, she said. ""People should keep their children home if they think they might have mumps and contact their GP and Healthline.""[Byline: Sally Murphy]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[While most of these cases were likely acquired out of the country, it highlights the importance of maintaining a high level of immunity in the local population since the virus can be introduced with infected individuals. - Mod.LKA map of New Zealand may be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>.]
