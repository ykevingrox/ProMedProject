Emergency clinics are being set up, although doctors have said that the chances that any patients were infected are ""very low"". Health officials say the locum medic, who worked in orthopedic surgery and A&E,åÊwas employed at 3 NHS hospital trusts between June 2010 and February 2015.åÊNottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital, has written to 223 patients recalling them for blood testing. The HIV-positive doctor also worked at Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, where 120 patients have been notified, as well as theåÊRoyal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust, where 57 patients are potentially affected.Dr Stephen Fowlie, medical director in Nottingham, said: ""Transmission of the virus between an infected health care worker and a patient with an open wound can only occur if health workers themselves have an injury with bleeding when they are delivering patient care. ""There is no evidence this happened to this doctor in any patient contact."" He said patients attending the emergency clinics would be promised a 24-hour turn-around on their blood tests.The Trust said the unnamed doctor's condition was not known during the time he worked there.Dr David Levey, regional medical director for NHS England Midlands and East, said: ""We understand that this will be a worrying time for patients who are being invited for precautionary testing and their families. However, clinical evidence shows that the risk of infection is extremely low, and it is highly unlikely that any of the patients being contacted will have been infected with HIV.""Officials emphasised that HIV could not be passed on by day-to-day contact, and while HIV-positive staff can work on patients, there were strict conditions in place.[byline: Henry Bodkin]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Transmission of bloodborne viruses in the health care setting is a 2-way street, from healthcare worker to patient, or vice versa.In general, the risk of HIV transmission is 10 times lower than that of hepatitis C, which in turn is 10 times lower than hepatitis B. The risk of transmission depends on viral load (how much infectious virus is the blood or other bodily fluid) and the nature of the exposure.No information is given regarding the kind of procedures performed by the infection surgeon or what level of viremia he was found to have or of the consistency of infection prevention techniques employed. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279>.]
