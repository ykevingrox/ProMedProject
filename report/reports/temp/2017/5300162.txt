Hawaii Tribune-Herald [edited]<http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/vigilance-urged-mumps-cases-increase-hawaii-island>The number of confirmed mumps cases on Hawaii Island has climbed to 8.""If you are seeing cases in your community, the likelihood of seeing additional cases should be expected,"" said Ronald Balajadia, immunization branch chief with the state Department of Health.He said people diagnosed with mumps on the Big Island range in age from 6--39. He declined to say where the new cases occurred.Earlier this month [September 2017], Naalehu Elementary School notified parents that mumps had been confirmed in a student. The student was asked to stay home for 2 weeks, the Ka'u-Keaau-Pahoa Complex Area superintendent said last week [week of Sun 27 Aug 2017].Mumps is a highly transmissible virus that vaccination had controlled until outbreaks began worsening in 2006. It's problematic because a person is contagious for 2 days before facial swelling starts and for 9 days afterward.Mumps has become a nationwide problem, with only 3 states reporting no cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: West Virginia, South Dakota and Wyoming. In Hawaii, 312 confirmed cases of mumps have been reported this year [2017].Balajadia's plea is that people diagnosed with mumps -- which has flu-like symptoms -- stay home from work or school while their condition is transmissible.He said vaccination against mumps is 88 percent effective, meaning 12 percent of vaccinated people are at risk for development of mumps despite the MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccination. Cases that develop among vaccinated individuals, though, tend to be less severe than without vaccination.Balajadia encourages people to talk with a physician about vaccination.People risk getting exposed, according to the CDC, by standing near someone who coughs or sneezes, sipping from the same glass of water, living in close quarters with a large group of friends or family, or eating from a shared plate of food.Why are mumps a problem now? Balajadia said it's been many years since a major mumps outbreak. Hawaii's vaccination rate for schoolchildren is greater than 90 percent, Balajadia said. That means 10 percent of children in school are susceptible because they're not vaccinated for religious or health reasons, and 22 percent of vaccinated people overall also are susceptible to mumps.""It's a large pool of susceptibles,"" Balajadia said. ""If people were not vaccinated to that degree, we would be seeing way more cases.""The Department of Health's website urges anyone born after 1957 to get an MMR vaccination if the person has had no vaccination, or only one dose.People born before 1957 are presumed to already have been infected with mumps and built immunity.All children are supposed to get 2 doses of MMR, one at age 12--15 months and a 2nd at age 4--6, the CDC recommends.However, the state DOH website recommends that ""due to the continued circulation of mumps in Hawaii, children between 1--4 years of age should receive their 2nd dose now.""The 2nd dose should be given at least 4 weeks after the 1st.The rise in Big Island cases, Balajadia said, should trigger people to be especially cautious about protecting themselves from exposure and about protecting others.Wash hands repeatedly, he urged. Avoid sharing cups, spoons and forks with others. If someone is coughing or sneezing, turn away.[Byline: Jeff Hansel]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) continues to investigate an increasing number of cases of mumps infections statewide.The disease has been confirmed in children and adults, both vaccinated and unvaccinated. Approximately half of cases have been in adults aged 18 years and older.As of August 31, 2017:Number of confirmed cases of mumps for 2017: 312Case count by island:Oahu 277Kauai 26Hawaii 8Maui 1(From 31 Aug 2017 State of Hawaii, Department of Health, Disease Outbreak Control Division<http://health.hawaii.gov/docd/department-of-health-investigating-mumps-cases/>)From 1 Jan -- 12 Aug 2017, 47 states* and the District of Columbia in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 4240 people to CDC.

Public health authorities say it poses a serious risk to young people who have not been vaccinated.Medical Officer of Health Josephine Herman said 60 percent of cases so far have affected young adolescents in the Pasifika community.Doctors are especially worried about what they describe as a lost generation, now aged between 10 and 29, who failed to get the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine when they were children because of a now discredited controversy about the vaccine.They say a pool of adults also missed out when the timing of free doses was changed in 2001, and that's left them at risk as well.Mumps has taken hold in Auckland but is also occurring across the country. There have been at least 12 cases in Dunedin, in its 1st outbreak of the disease in years.""This is a situation that we are not very happy to be in because much of this could have been prevented with immunisation with the MMR vaccine,"" Dr Herman said.She urged all those who failed to get the vaccine, or were not sure whether they had had the required 2 doses, to get the free jab now.""We shouldn't be seeing measles, rubella and mumps in this day and age, with the technology we have and the advances we have made in health service delivery.""Auckland GP Emalia Lavemai, who runs school-based clinics in south and eastern Auckland, agreed with Dr Herman.She said sterility was a rare complication of mumps for men, and there were other potential problems for pregnant women.""If they're not fully immunised and do contract mumps or rubella or measles, then there are an increase in miscarriage rates and other birth defects as well, if they contract [the disease] during their pregnancy.""A total of 80 percent of children up to 12 have had the MMR vaccine, but only 60 percent of P keh  children were covered in 1991, with rates for M ori and Pacific children lower at 42 and 45 percent respectively.Auckland University vaccine expert Helen Petousis-Harris said such low coverage meant the outbreak should have been expected, and it was not known how many of those aged 10 -- 29 are immunised.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The indigenous people lack sufficient vaccine coverage to protect them from an outbreak. It is important for public health officials to address this deficiency through education of the people on the importance and safety of vaccination.A Healthmap/ProMED of New Zealand can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>. - Mod.LK]
