The government had already prohibited crowds from gathering in order to curb the further spread of the dangerous disease that had sickened 343 people as of [Sun 8 Oct 2017], according to Health Ministry figures. On [Fri 6 Oct 2017], the ministry put the death toll at 36, with 250 sickened.""In the heavily populated capital, Antananarivo, 142 people have been infected. Schools in the affected cities of Antananarivo, Toamasina and other regions have been closed for a week,"" the health ministry said. Outbreaks of bubonic plague are common in Madagascar, which lies off Africa's southeastern coast, but the most recent outbreak has included cases of the more serious pneumonic form of plague. About 400 cases of plague are reported in Madagascar every year, most of them bubonic, which is transmitted by fleas. The much rarer pneumonic strain of the disease that is spread person-to-person is fatal unless treated within 24 hours.The WHO said it had delivered 1.4 million doses of antimicrobials to Madagascar in view of the plague. With this up to 5000 infected people can be treated and 100 000 can be given a prophylaxis. With early diagnosis, the chances of recovery are good,"" said WHO.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] ExportationsDate: Sat 7 Oct 2017Source: UPI [edited]<https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/10/07/WHO-acting-to-contain-Madagascar-plague-outbreak/9891507406347/>The WHO issued a warning about a worrisome outbreak of plague on the African island of Madagascar that has caused 200 infections and 33 deaths since September 2017 [as above, now 343 and 42 - Mod.LL].The outbreak of plague is an annual occurrence in Madagascar, which normally reports about 400 cases per year, usually in the remote island highlands. What makes this outbreak different, according to the WHO, is that many of the infected live in more densely populated towns and the capital Antananarivo. Also, the infections reported are pneumatic plague, which is transmitted through the air, making it much more difficult to control.Pneumatic plague is different from bubonic plague, which is the more common form on Madagascar. Bubonic plague is transmitted when an infected individual is bitten by fleas carried by rats. On Madagascar, the outbreaks are more common in rural rice farming areas and are not as easily transmitted. Both versions of the plague were the cause of the Black Death epidemic in the mid-14th century, which wiped out a 3rd of Europe's population.In response to the threat, Madagascar's government has closed schools, businesses and outlawed large public gatherings including concerts and sporting events where the disease could be spread to dozens or even hundreds of people at a time.The disease is already confirmed to have left the island after several participants in an international basketball tournament displayed symptoms after arriving home. One coach from the Indian Ocean island nation Seychelles died and another from South Africa was diagnosed but survived. Other tournament participants are being monitored for symptoms.The outbreak is similar in some respects to the deadly Ebola outbreak that ravaged parts of west Africa in 2014. Similar to Madagascar's outbreak, a single individual infected in an isolated area traveled to a population center, sparking a deadly outbreak.[Byline: Eric DuVall]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case count is growing. The date below is generally the day before the date of the report:Date / Cases / Deaths__________________14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5 30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 173 Oct 2017 / 194 / 305 Oct 2017 / 258 / 367 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42It was difficult to see that the fatality in the Seychelles basketball case had presented after returning home and apparently there is a related case in South Africa with a nonfatal outcome. The analogy to the west Africa Ebola outbreak is somewhat fitting as both had a primarily rural infection introduced in an urban setting. Certainly, cases in an urban setting are a major concern locally and with the possibility of air travel spread. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181>.]
