reliefweb, a Radio Dabanga report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-epidemic-stage-sudan-doctors-activists>Amid reports of hundreds of people who died from cholera in the past month [May 2017], doctors and activists say the Sudanese government and international relief agencies are not giving the aid and attention needed. The National Epidemiological Corporation reported the death of 820 people and the infection of more than 23 766 people with cholera since the start of May 2017.The newest report by the team of researchers, released on [Sun 11 Jun 2017], recorded 192 new cases of cholera in White Nile state: in Kosti, Wedelkaki, Rabak, El Jebelein and El Duweim. Reportedly 12 people died and 330 people were infected with cholera in both El Gedaref and Um Garkur refugee camps.As many as 3 people died of cholera in Northern state and 23 others were infected with cholera in both El Bargeig and El Mahas areas. There were 20 new cholera patients recorded in Red Sea state hospitals.On [Sun11 Jun 2017], 5 people died and 10 others were infected with cholera at Kambo El Kamayin, in El Haji Abdallah which is in the south of El Gezira.In Khartoum, 3 people died at El Banjadeed Hospital, while in the entire state a total 249 cases were recorded in 5 hospitals. In Khartoum Bahri (North), the emergency room in El Ezba district witnessed the death of 17 patients starting 2 weeks ago. The number of infected cases has run-up to 250.The Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre (DRDC) stated on [Mon 12 Jun 2017], that it believes Sudan is a cholera-endemic country ""and all factors for a large-scale pandemic exist"". The rainy season risks transforming the situation into a human tragedy of high proportion in case the epidemic finds its way to the conflict-ridden regions of the country such as Darfur, Blue Nile and the Nuba Mountains."" The population at risk is ""considerable"" because of poor access to clean water, food sources and optimal sanitation facilities, DRDC stressed.A spokesman for the National Epidemiological Corporation, Dr Ali Bashir told Radio Dabanga that the cholera epidemic ""will affect all the states of Sudan in a month and a half if the current situation is not responded to. The disease spread to 10 states in less than a month and people travel. This leads to the spread of the disease to eastern Sudan, northern Sudan, and North Kordofan. [Also] refugee camps in eastern Sudan are lacking the least services and suffering a terrible deterioration in the environment and water services amid a high density of population.""Dr Bashir attributed the continued spread of cholera in White Nile and Khartoum to the ""weakness of isolation and safety procedures, the deterioration of health services and poor health awareness of people"".--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi)Date: Fri 9 Jun 2017Source: Ghetto Radio [edited]<https://www.ghettoradio.co.ke/2017/06/09/another-person-dies-of-cholera-in-embakasi/>One person has been confirmed dead following cholera outbreak in Tassia Embakasi ward. According to Embakasi East sub-county health promotion head Mary Chwayi, 4 cases have been reported in Taasia and Jua Kali areas. Chwayi says the [the] deceased neglected early signs of cholera but the county health officers tried their best to save her life. Residents are now requesting the county government of Nairobi to set up an isolated center to only attend cholera victims.Meanwhile the county government of Nairobi has given 4 days to those selling foods in open places, to desist; failure to which they will be arrested.[Byline: Allan Otieno]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - Nepal (Lalitpur district)Date: Tue 13 Jun 2017, 2:50 AMSource: Himalayan Times [edited]<https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/cholera-alert-knocking-doors/>On [Mon 29 May 2017], a 21-year female from Satdobato, Lalitpur with a complaint of watery diarrhea and vomiting was brought to the local polyclinic. Stool culture was found positive for _Vibrio cholera_, commonly known as ""cholera"". The result was reported to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD). Due to the lack of stool sample, cholera could not be verified by EDCD. This is the 1st reported case of cholera in 2017 in Nepal. Over the past few days, there has been a sharp increase in the number of diarrhea cases; most of the stool samples were watery in nature.In 2016, a cholera case was 1st detected in late June. Early detection of cholera is a loud wake-up call for government-concerned bodies, including the general public. In Nepal, every year, cholera cases occur mainly during the monsoon season; it is, thus, expected that, sooner or later, more cholera cases will be detected in Kathmandu or elsewhere in Nepal.Cholera is potentially more life threatening and more epidemic than diarrhea caused by other organisms, thus it remains among the most feared diarrheal illnesses and public health threats in many countries. It is estimated that each year 30 000-40 000 die due to diarrheal diseases in Nepal, of which the majority of deaths occur due to cholera. A toxin release by the bacterium _Vibrio cholera_, causes severe diarrhea and vomiting leading to severe dehydration, shock and even death, if not treated immediately.Death from severe diarrhea is extremely rare in Kathmandu city due to easy access to health care centers. However, beyond the capital, particularly in remote villages; deaths due to severe diarrhea may be more because of difficult geographic terrain, meaning inability to visit health care facilities, and owing to lack of adequate intravenous fluids that are essential for saving life. For example, in 2009 a total of 128 deaths, mostly due to cholera, were recorded in Jajarkot, and the main reason behind the deaths was found to be difficult terrain.Cholera could be life threatening and spread rapidly, even in the city areas, if a new strain of cholera is introduced into the population, because people are not immune to it, and available medicines may not work properly and effectively. Multi-drug resistance is another emerging new challenge and causes difficulty in treating the patient effectively. Appropriate antibiotics or multi drug resistance is determined by the culture method. My previous research showed that cholera having a new biotype is emerging in Nepal, indicating that the currently used medicines may not work properly in the future. It is, however, not yet known how this new biotype will impact the community in the long run.[Byline: Sher Bahadur Pun]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
