L'Express, Agence France-Presse (AFP) [in French, machine trans., edited]<http://goo.gl/DUrF3d>A disease of unknown origin, manifested by a violent cutaneous ulcer, torments the inhabitants of SÌ£o TomÌ©. 1094 cases have been registered since October [2016] among a population of less than 200 000 inhabitants, the health authorities of the small African archipelago announced this [Fri 3 Feb 2017].The authorities have requested support from the World Health Organization (WHO), which has sent a Benin specialist in Buruli ulcer.--Communicated by:Dr Irene LaiInternational SOS<irene.lai@internationalsos.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Irene Lai for submitting the news report above.SÌ£o TomÌ©, with a population of 56 945 residents, is the capital city of the island nation of SÌ£o TomÌ© and PrÌ ncipe, in the Gulf of Guinea, off the western equatorial coast of Central Africa. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SÌ£o_TomÌ©>).Buruli ulcer (also known as the Bairnsdale ulcer in Australia) is a chronic skin and soft tissue infection due to _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms that can lead to adjacent bone infection and permanent disfigurement and disability. Buruli ulcer is named after a county in Uganda._M. ulcerans_ needs a temperature between 29-33 deg C (84.2-91.4) to grow in vitro (<http://jcm.asm.org/content/36/11/3420.full>). The organism produces a unique toxin -- mycolactone, which causes tissue damage and inhibits the immune response. Local immunosuppressive properties of the mycolactone toxin enable the disease to progress with no pain and fever. The diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture.Buruli ulcer has been reported in over 30 countries usually with tropical climates in Africa, South America, Asia, and Western Pacific regions, as well as Australia. Countries in West and Central Africa -- Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana -- report the majority of cases. In Africa, most cases occur in children under 15 years, whereas in Australia, only 10 per cent are children under 15 years; and in Japan, 19 per cent are children under 15 years._M. ulcerans_ has been identified in fresh and brackish water and soil in swampy areas. Abrasions of the skin after contact with contaminated water, soil, or vegetation are likely routes of entry. _M. ulcerans_ is not believed to be transmitted from person to person; but the exact mode of transmission is unknown and may vary by geographic region. Vectors, in particular aquatic insects and mosquitoes, may also play a role in some locations. In southeastern coastal Australia, possums, which have laboratory-confirmed _M. ulcerans_ skin lesions and/or _M. ulcerans_ PCR-positive feces, may be a reservoir (ProMED-mail post Buruli ulcer - Australia: (VI) M. ulcerans, possum feces 20140913.2771412).Buruli ulcer has been reported to develop in travelers at the site of a trauma after having left a disease-endemic area.80 per cent of cases detected early can be cured with a combination of antibiotics; however, late diagnosis can result in long and costly hospitalizations with significant morbidity and disability. Medical treatment is rifampin, combined with either streptomycin, clarithromycin, or moxifloxacin for 8 weeks, in addition to surgical wound management.Pictures of Buruli ulcers can be seen at (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCQ67NGmytI>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63>.]
