The virus has been identified as North American wild bird lineage H7N9 HPAI based upon full genome sequence analysis of the samples at the NVSL. All 8 gene segments of the virus are North American wild bird lineage.This is NOT the same as the China H7N9 virus that has impacted poultry and infected humans in Asia.While the subtype is the same as the China H7N9 lineage that emerged in 2013, this is a different virus and is genetically distinct from the China H7N9 lineage.--communicated by:Randall L Levings, DVM, PhD, DACVMScience, Technology and Analysis ServicesVeterinary Services, APHIS, MRP, USDA<Randall.L.Levings@aphis.usda.gov>[I am grateful to Dr Levings for the rapid response and update on this issue. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/244>.]
