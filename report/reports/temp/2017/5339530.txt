Voxy [edited]<http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/5/294083>Hawke's Bay District Health Board is investigating 4 confirmed cases of paratyphoid fever and is following up 3 suspect cases. All 4 confirmed cases have required hospital care at Hawke's Bay Hospital. At least 2 of the cases ate mussels gathered from Napier's Ahuriri area. The district health board is also concerned that mussels from the same area, may have been eaten at a Tangi [a Maori funeral rite - Mod.LL] at the Tangoio Marae 11 days ago, and is following that up.Medical Officer of Health Nick Jones said paratyphoid fever was a serious illness and a notifiable disease. ""It is most important people get medical care or call HealthLine if they are unwell."" People with the disease will have a fever, chills, headache, possibly a rash and may also get severe vomiting and diarrhoea.Paratyphoid generally occurs within 10 days of consuming contaminated food or water but symptoms may take as long as 4 weeks to develop. Anyone feeling sick and who consumed shellfish or has been in contact with anyone who had eaten shellfish from the Napier Marina should contact their family doctor or they could call HealthLine 24/7 0800 611 116.Dr Jones said the district health board had teams out in the community working to follow-up with anyone that was sick, but the most important thing was to get medical help if you or someone you knew was sick. ""People with paratyphoid fever can carry the bacterium in their blood and in their intestinal tract so it is possible for it to be passed on through feces. Hand washing was extremely important to help prevent infecting other people as you can get paratyphoid if you eat or drink things that have been handled by a person who has the bacteria,"" Dr Jones said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Paratyphoid fever is similar to typhoid fever, in that both are enteric fever types of disease rather than diarrheal, although the former can be, but is not necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into A, B, and rarely now C. _Salmonella Paratyphi_, is also more formally referred to as _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi. Much of the paratyphoid fever that has been reported on ProMED isthe L (+) tartrate + variant of _S._ Paratyphi B was previously referred to as _S._ Java. The classical _S._ Paratyphi B has the tartrate negative phenotype and is generally invasive causing an enteric fever-like illness similar to typhoid fever. Although the tartrate positive variant can be invasive, it generally is less invasive, associated with diarrhea. More information regarding the organism and the scope of the cases would be appreciated.Like typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis, with [only] humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has been isolated from domestic animals and fish.Hawke's Bay Region is a region of New Zealand on the east coast of the North Island.
