AKIpress [edited]<http://akipress.com/news:581604>The Kazakh authorities announced on [Mon 28 Aug 2017] that at least 3 more people from the central Karaganda region's city of Balkhash have contracted anthrax...--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a description of Karaganda Region, go to: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaganda_Region> and to locate Balkhash, go to: <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KZ/12/Balqash.html>. This is in the heart of Kazakhstan.Considering the numerous outbreaks in Karaganda in 2016 (see below), this is presumably a re-occurrence in relation to a severely contaminated site, or on a neighboring farm. Any comments by an informed person in Kazalhstan would be welcome. AKIpress insists on being paid for anything over the 1st sentence of an article. Not having 190 som readily available I must depend on our Kazakh members for additional information. Logically it is the same old story of slaughtering and butchering a sick animal. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56>.]
