Eagle Radio [edited]<http://www.964eagle.co.uk/news/local-news/2194701/deadly-meningitis-strain-is-on-the-rise/>There is a warning about a strain of meningitis hitting students returning to university in Surrey and Hampshire [UK]. There is growing concern about Men-W, which is increasingly affecting young adults. Meningitis has serious consequences and can prove fatal. Charity Meningitis Now is urging all students returning to university after the Christmas and New Year break to make themselves aware of the signs and symptoms of meningitis and to take up a free vaccine. Cases of the killer disease peak during the winter months, and students are a high-risk group.The charity's acting chief executive Rachel Robinson said: ""The ability to recognise meningitis and septicaemia quickly can save lives. ""The sooner you can get medical help, the less likely it is to become life-threatening. That's why learning the signs and symptoms is so important."" Early symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and muscle pain are very similar to flu or even a hangover, but someone with meningitis or septicaemia can get a lot worse very quickly. More specific signs and symptoms to look out for include fever with cold hands and feet, drowsiness, confusion, pale blotchy skin, stiff neck, dislike of bright lights, and a rash which doesn't fade under pressure.Rachel added: ""Prevention is also vital, which is why we're also encouraging all eligible young people to take up the free vaccine for Men ACWY. ""Hopefully our ongoing campaign will encourage more of them to take this simple and potentially lifesaving step."" Men ACWY immunisation was added to the national programme in August 2015 following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in response to the rising number of meningococcal W (Men-W) cases. But figures from Public Health England show that just 11.1 percent of 18-year-olds eligible to get the Men ACWY vaccine between April and July last year [2016] had taken up the offer, leaving about half a million young people in England in this age group still at risk from the disease.For more information, visit the Meningitis Now website.

Between July 2013 and June 2014, just 98 cases were reported in England and Wales, but 184 cases were reported between July 2014-June 2015, at which time, Men W accounted for 15 per cent of all meningococcal disease. In 2009, Men W accounted for only 1-2 percent of all meningococcal cases in the UK. The strain of Men W (ST-11) is particularly virulent, causing more severe illness and a higher case fatality rate.The vaccination schedule in the UK had been as follows: At 2 months of age, babies were given meningococcal serogroup B (Men B) vaccine; at 3 months of age, Men C vaccine; at 4 months, a 2nd dose of Men B; at 12-13 months, a 3rd dose of Men B and a 2nd dose of Men C in a combined vaccine with _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib); and at 13-18 years of age and 1st-time university students, meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (Men ACWY) vaccine (<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx>).Since the Men C vaccine was introduced in 1999, the Men C disease has been virtually eliminated in the UK. Nowadays, there are just a handful of Men C cases each year, mainly in older, unvaccinated adults (<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx>). However, the near elimination of Men C as a consequence of the Men C conjugate vaccine program in the UK has been followed by the emergence of a ""replacement"" pathogen, Men W. Consequently, starting on 1 Jul 2016, the dose of Men C vaccine that had been offered to babies at 3 months of age has been removed from the vaccination schedule (<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx>). All children will continue to be offered the Hib/Men C vaccine at one year of age, and the tetravalent Men ACWY vaccine at 14 years of age, and students up to the age of 25 1st going to university, to prevent Men W disease (<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx>).South East England is the most populous of the 9 official regions of England and includes the counties of Hampshire, Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, the Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, and West Sussex.
