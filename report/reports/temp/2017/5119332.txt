The young person had not been vaccinated.The head of Epidemiology of SEDES [Departmental Health Services], Arturo Quinones, according to a report of Radio Fides of Cochabamba, said that this person could not have been vaccinated during the mass vaccination campaign done in 2007 that was for people 12-49 years of age, as he was just 9.""I state that the death of an 18-year-old person diagnosed with yellow fever includes in the history that this person had not been vaccinated in the 2007 vaccination campaign; we vaccinated [people] 12-49 years of age, and he did not go to the vaccination post because he did not have the opportunity to receive the vaccine,"" Quinones said.The youth travelled various time to the tropics, and on one of these occasions got the disease and later went to a health center in the tropics [Villa Tunari Hospital?], and they had him sent to the Viedma Hospital [in Cochabamba] where he died, after 6 days of hospitalization. This is the 1st death after many years [without cases].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in the Amazon Basin, including the Bolivian tropics. Sporadic human cases occur there as spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. On 9 Jan 2017, a Danish tourist who came to Caranavi in the tropical area of La Paz department, Bolivia became infected with the virus. Individuals residing in or traveling to these areas should be vaccinated at least 10 days before possible exposure to the virus. Had the young man in the above report done this, he would still be alive.Maps of Bolivia can be seen at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7048>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Canada (Saskatchewan) vaccineDate: Mon 19 Jun 2017Source: Regina Leader-Post [edited]<http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/north-american-shortage-of-yellow-fever-vaccine-prompts-changes-in-sask>Due to a shortage of yellow fever vaccine across North America, Saskatchewan clinics will be providing partial doses of the vaccine to residents travelling to affected areas.Full doses will be made available only if residents are travelling to a country where there is a current outbreak of yellow fever; or if they will be living for more than a year in a country where the risk of contracting the disease is high; or if they are travelling to a country where they might be at high risk and they require an international Certificate of Vaccination or prophylaxis for entry and/or visa requirements.The criteria are subject to change at any time depending on availability of the vaccine.A partial dose of the vaccine will be provided to those who do not meet the criteria for a full dose.When a vial of yellow fever vaccine has been opened, it must be used within an hour. Therefore, people requiring a partial dose might have to make 2 visits to their travel clinic. On the 1st visit, they will receive a travel health assessment and the 2nd to receive the vaccine. This will help ensure no part of the vaccine is wasted.In Saskatchewan, yellow fever vaccine is only available through travel clinics in Saskatoon, Regina and Prince Albert.Some clinics in Alberta, Manitoba and British Columbia have already moved to offering partial doses of yellow fever vaccine to maximize the supply.The vaccine shortage could extend until 2018.Anyone who has received the yellow fever vaccine in the past is considered protected for life. It is important to find and keep the vaccination documents for border proof.The risk of transmission of yellow fever does not necessarily occur throughout a country. This is important to consider when planning travel to countries, such as Brazil, where the risk of the disease is present.If you have not booked your travel, determine whether yellow fever vaccination is required for your trip.

Several Canadian provincial travel clinics have already taken steps to extend the vaccine availability by providing partial doses of the vaccine. The volume of the partial dose is not mentioned. Partial doses (dose-sparing) of 1/5th the normal dose were given during the YF outbreak in the DR Congo after the outbreak in Angola spilled over there. Supplies of the vaccine were inadequate to provide full-dose coverage of the population at risk at that time. The limited literature available about dose-sparing vaccination indicates the protection is provided for at least a year. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Saskatehewan can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/263>.]
