Carbon monoxide readings in the hotel's enclosed pool area were 16 times higher than normal levels, the fire department told the news station.Authorities have not released the name of the child who died Saturday afternoon [1 Apr 2017].Heidi Prescott, a spokeswoman for Beacon Health system, told The Washington Post that 6 children had been brought to Memorial Hospital, along with 1 law enforcement officer. 6 other patients -- including the child who died -- were taken to nearby Lakeland Hospital, said spokeswoman Megan Yore.The Sheriff's office and the fire department didn't immediately provide details about the incident. Prescott said the hospital could not provide the names or ages of the victims.Each year, more than 400 Americans die of carbon monoxide poisoning and another 20 000 visit the emergency room, according to the CDC.A USA Today investigation of carbon monoxide poisonings at hotels found that between 2010 and 2012 the gas led to the death of 8 people and sickened more than 170 people. The report also said that hotels rarely had carbon monoxide alarms.In 2013, [an adult male and female] died at a Best Western in Boone, North Carolina. 6 weeks later an 11-year-old [boy] died in the same room, according to an investigation by the Charlotte Observer. The cause of death was a carbon monoxide leak in the heating system for the swimming pool, just below the room where the deaths occurred.[Byline: Cleve R Wootson Jr]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It seems indoor pools may present a problem regarding carbon monoxide. It is also odd that there are not carbon monoxide warning systems in public hotels. While the chances may be low, the cost of the monitors is not worth a person's life. And, as reported in this article, more than 1 person died in a very short time. There are likely others not making newspapers and local news stations.Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas. Clinical signs such as headache and fatigue and even nausea, early warning signs, may be taken as dehydration and stress in traveling individuals. Depending upon the time of year, the clinical signs may reflect as the flu, thus people think they are becoming ill and a good night's sleep will help. Sadly, this is how the person can die.The skin may be pink or flushed, the lips bright red. For although asphyxiation by carbon monoxide may be the diagnosis, cyanosis does not occur. The carbon monoxide binds to the hemoglobin producing carboxyhemoglobin. This prevents the oxygen from being released to the tissues where it can be utilized. The oxygen is there, but unable to be used and thus the tissues are a red or pink color.Treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is oxygen, or even better, oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber. If you are at home, please remember your pets. They are as susceptible as children. Long term brain damage can be a problem, even if treated early. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55826>.]
