MIMS [edited]<https://today.mims.com/topic/siblings-infected-with-pertussis-isolated->Up to 2 foreign siblings - reported to have contracted whooping cough (pertussis) in Keningau, Sabah - have been placed in isolation, announced Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam. The siblings are 2-years-old and 7-months-old, respectively. He added that, on top of isolating the siblings for 2 weeks, health authorities would conduct immunisation tests in the affected area.""We will test the immunisation status of the people around there and ensure that all of them are vaccinated. We also ensure that these (infected) children are being isolated, so that they don't spread to others until we are confident that the risk of spreading will not be there,"" asserted Subramaniam. ""This will usually take not more than 2 weeks,"" added Subramaniam, after solemnising the foundation stone laying ceremony of Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Tamil (SJKT) Heawood, in Sungai Siput, last week [week of Sun 30 Jul 2017].Prior to this, Health Director-General Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah commented on the state of the non-Malaysian siblings as well. According to him, the siblings - who were receiving treatment at the Keningau Hospital - had never received their whooping cough immunisations.President of Malaysian Paediatric Association (MPA), Dr N Thiyagar said some vaccines wear off as children grow older. He added that teenagers in some countries have been encouraged to take vaccinations for the cough. ""We especially encourage teenagers and the elderly to be vaccinated, so they don't become a source of infection for young children,"" advised Thiyagar. ""The elderly are also encouraged to get the jab because their immune system would have weakened and make them susceptible to various infectious diseases, including pertussis,"" he elaborated.In Thiyagar's personal experience, most pertussis cases were among babies who were too young to be immunised. The majority of cases are also made up of babies who fail to complete the 3-dose regime when they catch the infection.An internal circular from the Keningau Health Office to the Health Department went viral on [Fri 4 Aug 2017]. It requested that a pertussis outbreak be declared after the detected cases. This leaked memo largely sparked anxiety amongst the Malaysian society. At that time, State Health director Dr Christina Rundi, neither denied nor confirmed the matter. She merely stated that the internal circular was not meant for the public eye.Noor Hisham advised the public to stay calm as the incident in Sabah was remote. ""The State Health Department has stepped up prevention and control by visiting their homes and giving immunisation to the children,"" he said.Noor Hisham explained that the bacterium, _Bordetella pertussis_, causes whooping cough. This airborne infection, subsequently, causes inflammation of the mouth, nose and throat. It has the potential to infect every individual, but children who are not fully immunised are more prone to contracting this infection.[Byline: Reshmin Kaur Cheema]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Sabah, with a population of about 3.5 million residents, is one of the 2 East Malaysian states situated on the northern coast of the island of Borneo, bordering the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the southwest, and Kalimantan of Indonesia to the south; Kota Kinabalu is the capital city (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabah>).Keningau, with a population of about 200 000 residents, is a district and 5th largest town in Interior Division, Sabah (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keningau>).

The Forsyth County Department of Public Health is urging people to update their vaccine.Pertussis is a highly contagious but preventable bacterial infection that causes uncontrollable, violent coughing lasting up to 10 weeks. Although easily spread in schools, the disease does not only affect children; adults can develop whooping cough and are often not diagnosed until later in the illness.Symptoms [include]: Severe fits of coughing, including rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched, ""whoop"" sound; Coughing fits followed by vomiting; Exhaustion after coughing fits; Apnea (temporarily stopped breathing-usually in infants). Symptoms can vary by individuals. Contact your doctor if you suspect you or your child is experiencing pertussis symptoms.State law requires all kindergartners and rising 7th grade students be up to date on their pertussis vaccination before the beginning of the school year. Children under 7 years of age should receive 5 doses of DTaP. DTaP is a vaccine series that helps children younger than age 7 develop immunity against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. It is recommended that the DTaP series begin at 2 months of age, and continue at 4 months, 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years of age.For older children and adults a different vaccine, the Tdap, is given. Children 7 through 10 years of age should receive one dose of Tdap if they were not fully vaccinated with DTaP. Adolescents through age 18 should receive one dose of Tdap, preferably between the ages of 11 and 12. Everyone 19 years of age or older should receive one dose of Tdap.The Tdap vaccine is highly recommended for the following populations: Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant; Anyone who has close contact with infants under 12 months of age (parents, siblings, grandparents, household contacts, child care providers); [and] Anyone with a pre-existing, chronic respiratory disease.Pertussis vaccine (DTaP and/or Tdap) is available through all state immunization providers, including private healthcare providers, and may be available at no cost for those with Medicaid or no insurance at the Forsyth County Department of Public Health. The immunization clinic is a walk-in clinic and does not require appointments.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Forsyth County, with a population of 350 670 residents, is located in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of North Carolina; its county seat is the city of Winston-Salem (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth_County,_North_Carolina>).

The district posted a notice to its website after the Orange County Health Department confirmed the cases. Parents also were notified by email.Officials say the affected students were up-to-date with their immunizations, but that the DTap vaccine - which wards against whooping cough - doesn't provide 100 percent coverage while children age. Health officials say booster vaccines may help curb the spread of infection.Pertussis is particularly dangerous for infants and expectant mothers. Health experts say it starts off like a regular cold, but eventually causes a severe, high-pitched cough.Officials say the students may have been infected while playing sports together. News 12 is told they are being treated and that the outbreak seems to be contained.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>Orange County, with a population of 372 813 residents, is located in the Mid-Hudson Region of the Hudson Valley region in the U.S. state of New York; Rockland County borders it to the southeast and the U.S. state of New Jersey to the southwest (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_New_York>).

Thirteen years ago, [their son] became ill with whooping cough. At just 7-weeks-old, he nearly died. ""It was awful. He couldn't breathe,"" [his] mother said. The memory of that time still brings the Canmore mom to tears. ""I will never forget it - they had to suck out his lungs. A 7-week-old baby and they had to suck out his lungs just so he could breathe."" [The mother] says her son spent 22 terrifying days in hospital, fighting to survive an infection that can be fatal for babies. ""Children can still die from pertussis (whooping cough) even in the care of a physician. We were certainly told that when [her son] was in the oxygen tent and going through that process,"" said [the son's] dad.It's what health officials in southern Alberta are most afraid of as an outbreak of whooping cough continues more than a month after it was 1st declared. There are 168 cases now connected to the outbreak in the south zone, while there have been 394 cases so far this year [2017] province-wide. ""We have had infants in the past who have died (from whooping cough) at a very young age, so that's what we're hoping to avoid with all of this - we want to protect those most vulnerable,"" said Dr. Karin Goodison, Alberta Health Services Medical Officer of Health for the south zone.The best protection against whooping cough is immunization, but in pockets around the province, Goodison says vaccination rates are very low. As a result, outbreaks of diseases like whooping cough, measles and mumps have become common. ""Once it starts in that area, we get a large number of cases in high concentration and that's when we get an impact on our immunized populations.""[Byline: Heather Yourex-West]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[For a discussion of pertussis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA: (CA) fatal 20150115.3093551 and my colleague Mod.LL's comments in Pertussis - USA (06) 20160917.4495935. - Mod.ML]
