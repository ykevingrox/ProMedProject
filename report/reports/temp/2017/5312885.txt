While substances like ammonia and chlorine may have recognizable smells, other gases may include combustion or industrial gases such as sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen oxides, which may not be quite as recognizable. There are not enough signs and symptoms provided to make much of a supposition as to which gas or gasses may have been involved. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3697>.].................................................sb/tg/mj/jh"
