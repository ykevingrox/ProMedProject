A new study has shown another site for EBOV infection: the lungs.Citation: Biava M, Caglioti C, Bordi L, et al.

PLoS Pathogens. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006065>.Author Summary:An unprecedented Ebola outbreak occurred in 2013-2016 in West Africa. In order to better understand EBOV infection patterns in different body compartments, we have longitudinally explored the presence of already assessed markers of ongoing EBOV replication (negative sense genomic RNA and positive sense RNA) in the upper and lower respiratory tract, as compared to plasma and other body compartments, in a Health Care Worker infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone, who was hospitalized in the high isolation facility of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases ""Lazzaro Spallanzani"" (INMI), Rome, Italy. The presence of total EBOV RNA and replication markers was observed in specimens of the lower respiratory tract, even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting possible local replication. Our results contribute to the knowledge on the biological features of EBOV and shed light on the potential role of respiratory compartment in human-to-human transmissibility.[A new risk for transmission of EBOV after ""recovery"" has been identified in the respiratory tract, where markers of viral replication, and not only RNA, have been detected, presenting yet another hurdle to control of spread. - Mod.LK]Vaccine------5 Jan 2017: Merck's vaccine [rVSV-ZEBOV] won't be the end of Ebola<https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603288/mercks-vaccine-wont-be-the-end-of-ebola/>An [Ebolavirus] vaccine that has been in development for 15 years has been shown in a clinical trial to be up to 100 percent effective at preventing the deadly virus. But it won't stop sporadic cases from popping up, nor will it be immediately available to some who are most vulnerable to the virus. The vaccine is only meant to be used to stop the spread of an existing outbreak. Once WHO [World Health Organization] identifies new Ebola cases, only people most at risk of being exposed to a sick person -- like family members, health-care providers, or sanitation workers -- would receive the vaccine if it's approved.[...and more on the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine]:3 Jan 2017 Ebola vaccine developed by Merck is the 1st to be highly effective in preventing human infection with Ebola<http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/01/03/historic-success-for-ebola-vaccine-in-guinea-trial_c1481647>Merck's rVSV-EBOV has already been used in Sierra Leone to contain a flare-up there.The Guinea trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-GuinÌ©e, which was still seeing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015.  It used a ""ring vaccination"" approach, in which, when a new Ebola case was diagnosed, researchers traced all people who might have been in recent contact and logged them as clusters, or ""rings,"" made up of an average of 80 people.At first, the clusters were assigned to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay. After interim results showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately, the trial design was switched to allow all clusters to be given the shot straight away.  The WHO said that if Ebola outbreaks occurred before the vaccine was given full regulatory approval, it could be made available through a compassionate use procedure after informed consent.John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whose team helped design the trial, hailed its success as ""historic.""  ""When Ebola strikes again, we will be in a much better position to offer help to affected communities, as well as protect the brave volunteers who help control this terrible disease,"" he said in an emailed statement.GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, provided USD 5 million earlier this year [2017] to buy 300 000 doses of rVSV-EBOV as a stockpile for use during future Ebola outbreaks.][...and more on the vaccine, discussing the unknowns that moderate enthusiasm]:7 Jan 2017: New Ebola vaccine can't be used for prevention, World Health Organization Warns.<http://www.inquisitr.com/3861319/new-ebola-vaccine-cant-be-used-for-prevention-world-health-organization-warns/>While an experimental Ebola vaccine has been shown to be 100 percent effective in preliminary trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that it cannot be used as a preventative vaccine, and it is unknown whether it is safe for children, pregnant women, or some other populations, MIT Technology Review reports. ...moreMarie-Pierre Preziosi, head of the Initiative for Vaccine Research at the WHO, ... explained that there are several factors that make it impossible to vaccinate entire populations as a protection against Ebola with the GMO vaccine.1st, it is unknown how long the vaccine lasts. Some vaccines offer protection that may last for decades, while others last a very short time. Unless the WHO is able to determine that the new Ebola vaccine offers long-lasting protection, it could only be used to treat people once outbreaks are already occurring...It is unknown whether the experimental vaccine is safe or effective for pregnant women, children under 6, or people who are HIV positive. These groups are some of the people most at risk for Ebola. Studies to determine the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for these groups are just now getting started.Another issue is that most Ebola outbreaks around the world are now under control, so it is extremely difficult to determine how effective any vaccine is against the deadly disease. Ebola is too dangerous to intentionally expose people to it, leaving researchers with no accurate way to gauge how effective the vaccine really is.Yet another issue is that there are different strains of Ebola, which means that vaccines that work against one strain of Ebola may not work against another. Preziosi says that doctors will need to have a combination of vaccines and therapeutic options in order to mount a truly effective campaign against Ebola in the long term. ...more][The unknowns raised here are extremely important and moderate excitement over this vaccine; but, nonetheless, it looks very effective at this stage of testing.Citation for paper: AM Henao-Restrepo, A Camacho, IM Longini et al.
