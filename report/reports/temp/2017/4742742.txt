The Washington Post [summ., edited]<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/03/4-children-killed-after-pesticide-released-toxic-gas-underneath-their-home-police-say/>By the time 1st responders arrived at the [mobile] home in Amarillo, Texas, early [Mon 2 Jan 2017], one child inside was already unconscious. Other members of the household were sick and disoriented. Firefighters used CPR to attempt to revive the unresponsive child but could not.Officials said 6 people were rushed to a hospital, where 3 more children from the [mobile] home would later die.The culprit was not what they thought at first. ""They initially thought this was going to be carbon monoxide,"" Amarillo police spokesman Jeb Hilton said. But interviews with family members -- as well as a distinct odor in the [mobile] home -- ruled out the colorless and odorless gas, he said.Instead, investigators concluded that someone had used a professional-grade pesticide containing aluminum phosphide under the [mobile] home .At some point, a family member tried washing the chemical from underneath the [mobile home] with water, according to an Amarillo Fire Department statement.The combination of water and aluminum phosphide creates phosphine, a gas that can cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs and cardiac arrest if inhaled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials said they believe it was exposure to this gas that sickened the family and ultimately killed 4 of its children.""It's a very lethal chemical,"" Amarillo fire spokesman Larry Davis said. ""It causes pulmonary edema and basically the lungs fill up with fluid. We don't know that that's the cause of death so far, but that's one of the more severe symptoms. It took us a long time to identify the chemicals.""Potter County Justice of the Peace Gary Jackson identified the deceased children as a 17-year-old female, an 11-year-old male, a 9-year-old male, and a 7-year-old male.Jackson identified the parents as victims. As of Tuesday morning [3 Jan 2017], [one of the parents] and 4 unidentified children were in stable condition at a hospital in Amarillo, he said.[The other parent] was airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas. A spokesman for the hospital in Lubbock told The Post that [this parent] remained in critical condition Tuesday morning [3 Jan 2017].Jackson told The Post that autopsies are pending and toxicology reports would probably take an additional 3-4 weeks.Neighbors told the Amarillo Globe-News they had seen the children playing outside over the past couple of days and that the boisterous family kept the neighborhood ""alive.""""They're a good family,"" one neighbor, told the newspaper. ""They were very family-oriented and took care of their family. The whole family is friendly. It just hasn't sunk in what's happened.""The same neighbor told The Post on [Tue 3 Jan 2017] that no other houses on the street seemed to have been affected and that they were not evacuated.Another neighbor, said [the parent presently in critical condition] had asked him recently about getting a cat for a rodent problem they were having at the [mobile] home -- which likely led to his decision to use the pesticide.Police do not know how long the family had been exposed to phosphine and are treating the incident as an accidental poisoning with no criminal intent, the fire department said in a statement.Although some local media outlets specified a pesticide brand, Hilton said [Tue 3 Jan 2017] that it was unclear what type of fumigant was used.""I know it's hard to get a hold of,"" Hilton said. ""It's not something that the normal citizen could get their hands on. It's something that a licensed pest-control person would have.""Several 1st responders were taken to the hospital as a precaution [Mon 2 Jan 2017], but no other people were injured, police said.The department's special crimes unit was still investigating the scene [Tue 3 Jan 2017], he said. ""We have to determine what we need to do to make this [mobile home]  safe for people to live in again,"" Hilton said.[Byline: Amy B Wang]--Communicated by:Karyn Bishoff<KLB72@cornell.edu>[Aluminum phosphide (AlP -- Al is for aluminum and P is for phosphide) is a highly toxic, low cost, effective, and commonly used pesticide, a fumigant for control of insects and rodents. It is primarily used for indoor fumigation of raw agricultural commodities, animal feeds, processed food commodities, and non-food commodities in sealed containers or structures, and for outdoor fumigation of burrows to control rodents and moles in non-domestic areas, non-cropland, and agricultural areas.Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are formulated as tablets, pellets, impregnated materials and dusts. Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are restricted use chemicals. The use by certified pesticide applicators with respect to rodent control for burrows at least 15 feet (4.6 m) from a residential structure is considered a residential use.Aluminum and magnesium phosphide react with moisture in the atmosphere to produce phosphine gas, which is the substance that is active as a pesticide. It liberates lethal phosphine gas when it comes in contact either with atmospheric moisture or with hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The release of phosphine gas from AlP is immediate when mixed with aqueous solutions, such as water, and leads to rapid absorption through the lungs and gut when swallowed. Its gaseous form and toxicity makes it a potential agent for chemical terrorism.Unfortunately AlP is now one of the most common causes of pesticide poisoning among agricultural workers.The mechanism of toxicity includes cellular hypoxia due to the effect on mitochondria, inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, and formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The signs and symptoms are nonspecific and instantaneous.The toxicity of AlP particularly affects the cardiac and vascular tissues, which manifest as profound and refractory hypotension, congestive heart failure, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. The diagnosis of AlP usually depends on clinical suspicion or history, but can be made easily by the simple silver nitrate test on gastric content or on breath. Due to no known specific antidote, management remains primarily supportive care.Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are in Toxicity Category I, the highest (most toxic) of 4 categories, for acute effects via the inhalation route. No significant exposure to phosphine gas is expected via dermal routes, although rarely dermal absorption has been the route of lethal exposures. The Environmental Protection Agency does not believe that aluminum and magnesium phosphide pose a carcinogenic concern.Histopathological findings of vital organs were found to be suggestive of cellular hypoxia. Myocardial muscles in non-survivors showed myocyte vacuolation, areas of myocytolysis and degeneration. Histological changes on human brain showed disorganisation of the different layers, paucity of glial cells, degeneration of neurons, and appearance of necrotic patches. In other organs like in lung, diffuse vessel injury with edema and atelectasis; in liver, centrilobular necrosis; and in kidney, tubular degeneration findings may be present.The permissible exposure limit of phosphine is less than 0.3 ppm in the working environment and levels greater than 50 ppm are dangerous to life, while at 400-600 ppm it is lethal within half an hour. Individuals working in the manufacturing facility of AlP or methamphetamine (phosphine is a by-product), engaged in placing AlP tablets on the stacks of grains, and in the vicinity of application are at risk for unintentional exposure of phosphine gas, with few reported fatalities.Cases have existed in animals fed grain that was exposed to phosphine tablets but not allowed to sit for long enough prior to being fed to the animals. Animals have died in all of these cases.This is a very sad and tragic situation. What remains as an unanswered question is how did the household owner/occupant get the product without a license or why was there no education involved if a professional placed the tablets under the mobile home?Parts of this comment were extracted from <https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-066501_1-Dec-98.pdf> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2564148/>. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/754>.]
