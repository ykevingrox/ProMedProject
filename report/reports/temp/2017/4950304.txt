Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/leishmaniasis-outbreak-reported-cameroon-58045/>The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) of Cameroon reported in mid-February [2017] cases of acute fever and rash syndrome of unknown etiology being reported from the Far North [Extreme North] and North regions of the country.The major clinical manifestations of the illness included skin rash, persistent fever, malnutrition, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy. Laboratory results by the Centre Pasteur of Cameroon in YaoundÌ© have since shown this illnesses were due to cutaneous leishmaniasis.Retrospective investigation indicated that 48 cases with similar clinical features including 17 deaths (case fatality rate of 35.4 percent) had been registered between January 2016 and [24 Mar 2017]. These cases originated from 6 health districts (Bourha, Mokolo, Mogode, Hina, Maroua 3 and Soulede Roua) in the Far North region of Cameroon, and Mayo-Oulo district in the North region, the same areas where humanitarian crisis is occurring.A total of 36 of the 48 cases investigated had no established epidemiological links, negating contact contagion as a mode of transmission. Currently 6 cases are hospitalized in Mokolo district hospital.Leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoan _Leishmania_ parasites that are transmitted through the bites of infected female sandflies. The disease is associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune system, and poverty. These factors are prevalent in the Far North and North regions of the country, in addition to availability of the vectors.The outbreak of leishmaniasis in the Far North and North of Cameroon has been going on insidiously since January 2017 or beyond. Detection and confirmation of the outbreak took several weeks due to a number of factors, including weak surveillance system especially for neglected tropical diseases like leishmaniasis, inadequate laboratory diagnostic capacity and functional specimen transportation system, shortage of essential medicines and supplies for case management, limited numbers of trained health workers, etc. Some parts of the affected areas are also experiencing insecurity, with poor communication network to the rest of the country and limited coverage and accessibility to health services.The Ministry of Public Health has rallied several partners to mount an effective response to this outbreak. In the bid to address some of the existing challenges, the WHO is shipping pentavalent antimonials, paromomycin, rapid diagnostic tests and supplies for leishmaniasis testing and case management from its emergency stocks to Cameroon. A neglected tropical diseases (NTD) case management expert will be deployed from the WHO headquarters to work closely with the Ministry of Public Health.Cutaneous leishmaniasis was 1st described in Cameroon in 1930, with the 1st case reported from Mokolo in 1972. Between January 2007 and June 2009, 147 cases were reported from Mokolo; 60 percent of the affected people were under 15 years of age. Visceral leishmaniasis has also been reported in the north of the country, with the 1st case confirmed in 1986. Underreporting of the disease is thought to be substantial in the country.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There have been reports of an illness associated with an unspecified rash in Northern Cameroon 1st reported by ProMED on [21 Mar 2017] (see below). It is possible that these cases may be Leishmaniasis. However, the diagnostic procedures in this article are not described in detail, but we presume that either serology or PCR have been performed.Very little is known about Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in Cameroon and only _Leishmania major_ has been found (Alvar J, VÌ©lez ID, Bern C, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671. Annex 15, available at: <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671>).VL may be endemic in Kousseri region in the north of Cameroon. Between 1987 and 1988, in a survey among 120 people in Kousseri, 46 had clinical symptoms of VL and 9 of them were confirmed parasitologically and/or serologically (Kaptue L, Zekeng L, Fomekong E, Nsangou A, Tagu JP and Tchuela J. La leishmaniose viscÌ©rale au Cameroun. A propos de quelques observations et d'une prospection clinique dans la rÌ©gion de Kousseri, extrÌ»me-nord Camerounais. Bull. Soc. Pathol. Exot 1992;85:156-8 [in French]).An interesting possibility is that gorillas may act as host for Leishmania major in Cameroon (Hamad I, Forestier CL, Peeters M, Delaporte E, Raoult D and Bittar F. Wild gorillas as a potential reservoir of Leishmania major. J Infect Dis. 2015;15;211(2):267-73. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiu380, available at: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342692/>).Leishmaniasis is an HIV-related infection also in Cameroon (Ngouateu OB, Kollo P, Ravel C, et al. Clinical features and epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis and Leishmania major/HIV co-infection in Cameroon: results of a large cross-sectional study. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2012;106(3):137-42. doi: 10.1016/j.trstmh.2011.10.012, abstract available at: <https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article-abstract/106/3/137/1893169/Clinical-features-and-epidemiology-of-cutaneous?redirectedFrom=fulltext>). - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58518>.]
