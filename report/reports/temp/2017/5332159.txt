In a report released [Thu 21 Sep 2017], the WHO also said at least 2103 cholera-related deaths had been recorded in 22 out of Yemen's 23 provinces. Yemen's Socotra province, a small four4island archipelago in the Arabian Sea, is the only part of the country to remain unaffected by the epidemic.According to the WHO, the highest number of fatalities, almost 400, were recorded in Yemen's northwestern Hajjah province, while the most number of cases, more than 91 000, have been recorded in the western Hudaida province.Yemen has remained dogged by violence since 2014, when Shia rebels overran much of the country. The conflict escalated in 2015 when Saudi Arabia launched an air campaign aimed at rolling back Houthi gains. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, more than 3 million Yemenis have fled their homes since the conflict began, while more than 20 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.[Byline: Mohamed al-Samei, Ali Abo Rezeg]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics related to this record-breaking epidemic of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 182825 Jul / 402 484 / 188026 Jul / 408 583 / 188529 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199720 Aug / 542 278 / 200325 Aug / 565 041 / 201830 Aug / 591 100 / 20354 Sep / 612 703 / 20488 Sep / 635 752 / 206217 Sep / 686 783 / 209020 Sep / 704 454 / 2103In the last complete year of data (2015); <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
