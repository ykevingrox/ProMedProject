Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cameroon-meningitis-outbreak-reported-yaounde-central-prison-64353/>A meningitis outbreak that began earlier this month [March 2017] at the Yaounde Central Prison in Kondengui has grown to about [24] cases in a matter of about 4 weeks.As of 24 Mar 2017, a total of 23 suspected/confirmed cases including 9 deaths (case fatality rate of 39 percent) have been reported. While majority of the affected people were prisoners, 5 suspected cases came from the surrounding community in the affected district.Outbreak investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health obtained 11 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, 5 of which tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) serogroup Y/W135 by rapid diagnostic test. Subsequent bacteriological culture isolated Nm W135 from 2 samples, thus confirming the outbreak.WHO supported the Ministry of Health to secure 7079 doses of ACYW tetravalent meningitis vaccine from the International Coordinating Group (ICG), targeting 6436 persons. Preparation for reactive meningitis vaccination campaign is being finalized.Since the outbreak occurred in a closed setting, chemoprophylaxis was administered to 4007 close contacts.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The northern portion of Cameroon is part of the African meningitis belt, a region in the semi-arid area of sub-Saharan Africa that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, where the rate of incidence of meningitis is very high. The northern provinces of Cameroon are periodically affected by meningococcal meningitis (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310568/>). A map of the African meningitis belt can be found at <http://www.meningvax.org/epidemics-africa.php>. The attack rate of meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt ranges from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1/100.In the early 1990s, meningococcus serogroup A was the most frequently identified serogroup in Cameroon; during the 2007 and 2008 meningitis seasons, an outbreak of meningococcus serogroup W135 was reported in northern Cameroon (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662656/>). In 2010, an outbreak (70 cases/100 000 inhabitants) of meningococcal meningitis due to serogroup A was reported in the northern region, a serogroup that had not been identified in north Cameroon since 2006 (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310568/>).Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, with a population of approximately 2.5 million, is in the Central Region of the nation, outside of the usual African meningitis belt. From 1999 through 2001, a few cases of meningitis were attributed to serogroup W135 in Yaounde (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732466/>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34100>.]
