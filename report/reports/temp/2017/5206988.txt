Food Poisoning Journal [edited]<http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/utah-arizona-e-coli-outbreak-hits-12-hamburger-not-cause/#.WXijWYjyjIU>Public health officials have ruled out ground beef as the likely source of an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak in southwest Utah, but they have not been able to pinpoint the source of the bacteria, which has already killed 2 children. ""While the investigation continues into a source for this _E. coli_ outbreak, we have determined ground beef is not a likely cause,"" according to the latest update from the Southwest Utah Public Health Department. ""The advisory not to consume previously purchased ground beef is discontinued.""Unpasteurized, raw milk is still being considered as a possible source for the _E. coli_ and the health department's recommendation to avoid consuming it remains in place. One additional person has been confirmed in the outbreak, bringing the total to 12 victims. Mohave County epidemiologist Anna Scherzer said this past week that confirmed cases in the outbreak are mostly children, including 2 who died. The 1st victim was a 3-year-old boy who died in June 2017. He and the other fatality, a 6-year-old girl, were not related but they lived in the same multi-family dwelling in Hildale, UT. [Byline; Bill Marler]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[At least 1 case of the cluster has apparently occurred across the Utah border in Arizona.The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS; whether the same effect would occur in adults; whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly; and what the mechanism of the effect is, are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some being defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).References:1.
