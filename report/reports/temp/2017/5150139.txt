""The virus can spread, even when there are no symptoms, through feces, from diaper changes and respiratory secretions. The contagion occurs in the first 3 days of contact and then the symptoms appear,"" said the Secretary of Health.They also warn that the disease can be confused with the common cold, flu or stomach infections, as it manifests with flu-like symptoms.Recommendations---------------Among the recommendations issued by health authorities are: - frequent hand washing and the use of individual cutlery; - shared toys such as in day-care centers should be disinfected regularly because the virus can live on these objects for several days;- avoid kissing others; - sneeze into your [tissue or handkerchief];- and go to the doctor with any symptoms; - avoid self-medication and notify childcare organizations, so that preventive measures can be taken to avoid further spread of the disease, especially to family members and childcare workers.Once treated, symptoms should disappear in a week and there is little risk of morbidity or mortality, as long as symptoms are promptly treated, the authorities state.Highest number of cases-----------------------In Mexico, the region with the highest number of registered cases is Tlaxcala (about 100), where the Ministry of Health (Sesa) promoted training for the population in general, nursery managers and educational institutions, to identify signs and symptoms.The Secretary of Health in Tlaxcala, Alberto Jonguitud FalcÌ n, reported that the patients are mainly inhabitants of the municipalities of Apizaco, Tlaxcala and Chiautempan. He explained that the State Commission for the Protection against Health Risks (Coeprist) supervises the chlorination and disinfection of water tanks and cisterns; ""We have carried out an exhaustive verification of the educational establishments and also verified chlorination in the water wells of localities that register cases.""In the Mixteca region of Oaxaca, where approximately 80 cases have been reported, education authorities have asked parents and school authorities to be alert.Hidalgo is the state with the 3rd-highest number of cases, reporting 61. The public policy director of the Health Ministry, ConcepciÌ n Carmona Ramos, said the outbreak has been concentrated in the central area, including the regions of Pachuca, Mineral de la Reforma, Tizayuca and the Tula-Tepeji, among others. She emphasized that since it is not a disease subject to epidemiological surveillance, a comparison with other years cannot be made; however, it is clear that its prevalence has increased in 2017. The official commented that, as schoolchildren are the most affected, there is constant coordination with the Ministry of Public Education, to carry out case control and surveillance.The State of Mexico has registered 40 cases, including 20 in QuerÌ©taro, 5 in Tamaulipas, and 3 in Zacatecas.The 1st outbreak was detected in the United States. The coxsackie virus is named after the city of Coxsackie, New York, where it was 1st discovered, although there are no data from the time when this occurred.Infections occur throughout the year, but in colder climates, outbreaks of coxsackie virus occur more often in summer and fall.--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>[Coxsackie virus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness. The virus is a member of the family _Picornaviridae_, genus _Enterovirus_, which also includes polioviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackie virus is highly contagious. Oral ingestion is the main source of infection and HFMD. The illness spreads by person-to-person contact with an infected person's nasal secretions or throat discharge, saliva, fluid from blisters, stool, respiratory droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or sneeze. Good hygiene must be maintained as the virus persists on surfaces for several days and infected individuals may shed virus for several weeks. Fortunately, the disease is generally self-limited.Information on these non-polio enteroviruses can be found at <https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/index.html>.
