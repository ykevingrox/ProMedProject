[So far] 4 of the people, including 2 children, had the O157:H7 strain of _E. coli_ identified, which health officials say is the most severe type of the bacterium. 2 of those cases [so far] genetically matched the strain found in the recalled IM Healthy SoyNut Butter that sickened 16 other people in 9 states. 2 other children in Clackamas County were also infected by the soynut butter, according to state health officials.The bacterium causes diarrhea and can produce a toxin that damages blood vessels, particularly in the kidneys.""We are working closely with families, staff, and school administrators to stop the spread of this infection and understand how this outbreak happened,"" said Dr Jennifer Vines, Multnomah County Deputy Health Officer.Most people with O157 strain of _E. coli_ get better within 5 to 7 days but others can have severe or life-threatening infections.The Health Department is working with the school to prevent the spread of the illness.[Byline: Grant McHill]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Only 2 of the CDC's latest listing of cases in this outbreak of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (<https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2017/o157h7-03-17/map.html>) were from Oregon, so with this report of 8 cases in the state, the total number is at least 22. 6 of the 8 cases were reported from the same preschool in Portland, Oregon.
