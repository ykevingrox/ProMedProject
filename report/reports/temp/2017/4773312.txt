Activities pursued during this trip including hiking, trekking, bathing in volcanic hot springs, and mud baths. During the last 42 days (the longest reported incubation period for HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]) prior to disease onset of both cases (see below), the couple frequently crossed the border between Chile and Argentina.Patient number 1: The husband presented to the Bern University Hospital (Inselspital) on [2 Dec 2016] (day 1) with fever, headache, extreme tiredness and one episode of diarrhea 3 days ago. Non-specific prodromal symptoms (malaise, headache) had started 2 to 3 days earlier. At presentation the patient was in good condition apart from fever to 39 deg C [102.2 deg F] and marked prostration. Malaria was excluded by rapid diagnostic test. Hantavirus infection (Andes virus species) was suspected and the patient was isolated with droplet and contact isolation precautions from December 3rd onwards. The patient deteriorated on day 2 of admission and required non-invasive ventilation for 4 days.Laboratory diagnosis was managed by the Institute for Infectious Disease, University of Bern, and included the primary diagnosis of infection with Andes virus by PCR and serology on [9 Dec 2016] by the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Germany, and independent confirmation by the Spiez Laboratory in Switzerland. Molecular confirmation was obtained by pan-Hanta-virus RT-PCR (Klempa et al, 2006) and sequencing of the amplicon and by specific qRT-PCR. Serology, detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against Hanta-viruses, was performed using immunoblot assay (Euroline Hantavirus profile global, Euroimmun). Droplet precautions were stopped once the patient's respiratory symptoms had ceased. Currently (day 46) the patient has recovered fully. PCR in whole blood remained positive on day 20 and day 39.Patient number 2: On [14 Dec 2016], the wife was tested negative for Hanta-virus specific antibodies (IgM/ IgG) by immunoblot assay and for Andes virus in serum by PCR after the diagnosis of her husband had been confirmed. At that time she complained of diffuse arthralgias and unusual tiredness, but no fever or respiratory symptoms. One week earlier she had suffered from productive cough, sore throat, two episodes of loose stools, but without fever.She presented to the emergency department on [20 Dec 2016] with nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Findings at presentation were: normal blood pressure, pulse 95/min, afebrile, oxygenation saturation 98 percent under ambient air. She was discharged with symptomatic treatment. On [23 Dec 2016] (day 1) she presented again, complaining of profound myalgias, headache, and fever of 38.5 deg C [101.3 deg F]. At presentation she was febrile [38.6 deg C/101.4 deg F], with normal blood pressure, pulse rate, and saturation at ambient air. Her laboratory evaluations showed thrombocytopenia (98 G/L) and leukopenia (1.88 G/L, of which 1.48 G/L neutrophils and 0.39 G/L lymphocytes) but normal liver and kidney function tests. Malaria was excluded by rapid diagnostic test (Binax Nowå¨) and blood smear. Common causes of respiratory infections were excluded by Cepheid, GeneXpert, Xpertå¨ Xpress Flu/RSV, and Biofire, FilmArrayå¨ Respiratory Panel. She was admitted under aerosol and contact precautions as a possible case of HPS due to Andes virus. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR on [24 Dec 2016] (Spiez Laboratory in Switzerland). On day 2 of hospitalization the patient rapidly deteriorated with cardio-pulmonary failure and required extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). Severe hemorrhagic complications followed, the patient required mass transfusions of blood products for 4 days. Given the patient's critical condition, IV ribavirin was added on day 3, although still considered experimental for treatment of HPS. Currently (day 25) she remains in stable, but critical condition, though her cardiac function is restored and her bleeding disorder has subsided. However, she remains dependent on ECMO treatment, intermittent hemodialysis, and antimicrobial treatment for nosocomial infections.--Cornelia Staehelin, MD, MIHDepartment of Infectious Diseases, InselspitalBern University Hospital, University of BernSwitzerland<cornelia.staehelin@insel.ch>[These cases illustrate the importance of taking a good travel history to arrive at an appropriate list of rule-outs and, in this case, determine Andes hantavirus as the etiological agent 1st in case one and then in case 2. It is difficult to guess exactly where and under which environmental conditions exposure to the virus occurred. The areas where the couple traveled are endemic for Andes virus. Their outdoor activities undoubtedly placed them in areas where the rodent reservoir of Andes virus was common. It is possible that the wife (patient 2) acquired her infection from her husband. Andes virus is the only hantavirus of the Americas known to be transmitted directly from person-to-person. That transmission mode is rare, occurring in situations of very close physical contact, usually in families, criteria that fits this couple. Placing the patients in isolation with droplet and contact isolation precautions was wise. The care providers in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, are to be commended for their prompt and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment for a disease that they may never had seen before.
