The prefecture of the territory of Belfort [Bourgogne-Franche-Comte region] announced the death of the person after contracting the infection.A statement by the state services said that 6 patients had been affected by legionnaires' disease in August [2017] in Belfort. Among them, one person died.The individual had multiple medical comorbidities. Environmental investigations carried out by the Regional Directorate for Environment, Planning and Housing (DREAL) are currently underway. The investigation aims to determine a possible common source of contamination. The health agency (ARS) plans to carry out analyses on the strain type(s) that affected the people.Legionellosis is a disease caused by the _Legionella_ bacterium (of which there are about 50 different species). In more than 90 percent of cases, it is _L. pneumophila_ that is involved and it affects especially the elderly and immunocompromised. The bacterium infects people by inhalation of contaminated water sprayed as an aerosol. It results in an acute lung infection that appears after an incubation period of a few days. The 1st warning sign is the appearance of an influenza[-like] syndrome (fever, dry cough, malaise, and muscle pain), but with a fever that rises rapidly to 39.5 deg C [103 deg F]. This leads to stomachaches and digestive problems with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Behavioral disturbances complete the picture with confusion, disorientation, and hallucinations, which can lead to coma.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The news report above says that genotyping is being done on clinical isolates of _Legionella_ to determine if this is a common source outbreak and likely will be doing genotyping of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ to determine an environmental source for the outbreak.Belfort, with a population of 50 199 residents, is a city in northeastern France in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comte region, located 400 km (249 mi) southeast of Paris between Lyon to the south and Strasbourg to the north (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfort>).
