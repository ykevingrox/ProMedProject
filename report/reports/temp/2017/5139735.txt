The lunch, served in the parish hall of the Church of St John the Baptist, was part of the commemorations in honor of St John, performed by the parish. According to Aldir Dias, clinical director of the SÌ£o Roque Charity Hospital in Faxinal do Soturno, 70 people were seen at the site on[ Mon 26 Jun 2017]. Another 80 received care at the Dr Roberto Binatto Health Center in SÌ£o JoÌ£o do PolÌ»sine. On [Tue 27 Jun 2017], 6 people were hospitalized in both hospitals as a result of complications in the clinical setting.About 90 percent of the patients who experienced the same symptoms reported that they began to feel ill after eating a mayonnaise salad that was served for lunch. All patients were diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis, possibly with salmonellosis, Dias said. The doctor explained that the main symptoms presented by the patients were vomiting, diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, weakness and loss of appetite. In addition, dehydration was the main complication presented by people who had to be hospitalized. The clinical director's suspicion is that some food may have been contaminated or spoiled. The SÌ£o JoÌ£o PolÌ»sine Sanitary Surveillance reported that on [Tue 27 Jun 2017] it would collect material from the parish to confirm what would have caused the general malaise.""Now we have to wait for the results of the tests to find out if there is any spoiled or contaminated food,"" said a Health Surveillance official who declined to be identified.Treasurer at the parish, Moacir Possebom said it was too early to say the painting was caused by the food served at lunch. ""I cannot be certain that it was or even that it was not the food."" Some people were here (in the parish) and told us that they had been ill even though they had not eaten any food that day. Other people also reported having eaten at lunch and showed no symptoms. We will wait for the results of the analysis to have a proof - said Possebom, claiming that his wife was one of the people who went wrong.[Byline: Michelli Taborda]--Communicated by:Bruno VizzottoUNIFRA<bvizzotto@yahoo.com.br>[ProMED thanks Bruno Vizzotto for contributing this post. - Mod.LL]******[2] Possible staphylococcus foodborne illness - EspÌ rito Santo StateDate: Mon 26 Jun 2017 08h33Source: G1 [edited]<http://g1.globo.com/espirito-santo/noticia/dezenas-de-convidados-passam-mal-apos-festa-em-marataizes-es.ghtml>Dozens of guests at a party went awry this [Sun 25 Jun 2017] with symptoms of gastroenteritis in MarataÌ zes in the south of EspÌ rito Santo. Of the 130 consultations carried out until the beginning of Sunday afternoon, in the prompt care of MarataÌ zes, 50 were people who presented symptoms of gastroenteritis.A 12-year-old teenager went with his father to his birthday party on [Sat 24 Jun 2017] night. He started to get sick at dawn and got worse in the afternoon. ""Pain in the stomach, pain in the belly, desire to vomit, headache,"" said the boy. The suspicion of the mother is that the food served at the party was the cause of the problem."" Soon, I realized that was the cause of the birthday because my husband said he felt the food was not good,"" said the mother.All the patients who went to the hospital with the symptoms told the same story, they were at a birthday party, and hours after dinner was served, they started to feel bad. The party happened in a house, in the Siri Lagoon region, in MarataÌ zes.A doctor explained that, in such events, care with the preparation of food should be redoubled to avoid contamination. ""A food, for example, that gets barely refrigerated, has the growth of bacteria and can lead to a subsequent infection,"" he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The relatively short incubation period illness with upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting) without diarrhea or fever being mentioned suggests preformed staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced illness.
