That's now the message in Italy, where the country's cabinet has approved a law which obliges parents to protect their children against a string of infectious diseases.Those up to 6 years old will not be accepted into nursery schools without proof of inoculations. And parents sending their children to school after that age without vaccinating them 1st will now face fines.""This is not an emergency, but it is a matter of concern to which the government intends to respond to,"" said Paolo Gentiloni, Italian Prime Minister. ""I am convinced that, with the necessary gradual steps, Italian families will have a much higher level of protection for their children than is currently the case.""It comes after a warning that a fall-off in vaccinations had led to a measles epidemic, an epidemic that's sparked a huge public debate. Some 2395 measles cases have been recorded so far this year [2017], compared with some 840 in all of 2016, and 250 in 2015.Vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox and meningitis, which were previously only recommended, will now become mandatory.The law will also oblige inoculation against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, whooping cough and haemophilia B.--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>andProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[A similar report in Spanish <https://www.xataka.com/medicina-y-salud/casi-3-000-casos-de-sarampion-en-italia-y-el-89-de-ellos-no-esta-vacunado-la-verdadera-epidemia-son-los-antivacunas> reviews the news and adds on the debate of the role the anti-vaccine groups have had on the new outbreaks.A map of Italy can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>][In the late 1970s, vaccination coverages had dropped in the USA and the implementation of mandatory vaccination for school entry was how the USA was able to increase vaccination coverages.  Unfortunately exceptions to this rule combined with the anti-vaccine movement has contributed to a resurgence of measles outbreaks in the USA as well as in European countries.  - Mod.MPP]******[2] UK, Wales, NewportDate: Mon 5 Jun 2017, 4 PMSource: ITV [edited]<http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2017-06-05/measles-outbreak-is-declared-in-newport-as-four-confirmed-cases-linked-to-newport-high-school/>A measles outbreak is being investigated in Newport as 4 people with links to a High School were confirmed to be infected. Parents of pupils at Lliswerry High School were contacted after 4 cases were confirmed. Children with measles symptoms have been told to stay home from school. Public Health Wales has since told parents to ensure their children have received both doses of the MMR Vaccine.Heather Lewis, Consultant in Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said: ""While 4 cases of measles may not sound a lot, we know that there are other children attending the school who are unvaccinated and could easily catch and spread measles. We urge parents whose children have not received 2 doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine. ""Vaccination is recommended as the most effective way to protect against measles which can cause serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia and meningitis, and death in rare cases.Vaccinations are taking place at Lliswerry High School this week as Public Health Wales continues to investigate the outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the United Kingdom can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>][The discussion in this article omits the occurrence of SSPE - subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a delayed complication of measles infection, and a devastating one for both the individual who had been infected and their family. - Mod.MPP]******USA---[3] Travelers: studyDate: Sat 3 June 2017Source: Study Finds [edited]<https://www.studyfinds.org/measles-vaccination-traveling/>More than half of U.S. adults recommended to receive vaccination against measles prior to traveling abroad didn't do so at health clinics, a new study finds.Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that 53 percent of eligible adults examined from 2009 to 2014 didn't receive the measles vaccine -- with about half refusing the recommended vaccination because they weren't worried.The new study of more than 40 800 patients born after 1956 and seen for pre-travel consultation at health clinics also found that 84 percent were determined to be immune to the disease after having gone through 2 MMR vaccinations in the past. Travelers eligible for the vaccine were least likely to receive immunization at clinics in the Southern U.S. or at nonacademic medical centers.""Measles has been eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, which means that all measles cases in the country can be traced back to an imported case - either a foreign visitor or a U.S. resident returning from international travel,"" says lead author Dr. Emily Hyle, of the MGH Division of Infectious Diseases, in a hospital press release.Nearly one-quarter (24 percent) of providers referred travelers over to another healthcare provider for vaccination, while 28 percent of consultations saw providers deciding not even suggesting MMR vaccinations.""It was surprising to see such a high number of missed opportunities for MMR vaccination, even at these specialized pre-travel consultations, but our results also suggest ways to improve the rate of MMR immunization among eligible travelers,"" says Hyle.For those without evidence of measles immunity, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends 2 documented doses of the MMR vaccine for adult travelers. Positive tests showing antibodies to the virus as well as a documented previous case of measles are sufficient evidence, the experts say.Worldwide, it's estimated that more than 300 children die from measles complications each day. In the United States, 667 cases were reported to CDC in 2014--the largest number of cases in a year since 1994. These cases resulted from people infected overseas bringing the virus into the United States.""Since more than 60 percent of the measles importations into the country are due to returning U.S. travelers, increasing the number of travelers who are immune to measles will reduce the number of measles cases,"" adds Hyle. ""We can definitely improve how often providers specializing in pre-travel medical advice offer MMR vaccine to eligible travelers and encourage clear discussions with patients about the risks of contracting measles and of spreading the disease after their return to the U.S.""The researchers caution that even singular cases of measles can trigger a major outbreak, particularly in communities or areas where there is a high number of people that never received immunization or are not immune. Although the virus may just cause fever-like reactions and symptoms, it can lead to more serious health consequences and hospitalization among children.""Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known - 90 percent of people who are not immune will contract measles from an even-minimal exposure to someone who is infected,"" says senior author Dr. Regina LaRocque, of Harvard Medical School.This study was published in Hyle EP et al.

However, thanks to a vaccine that was developed in 1968, measles was declared to be eliminated from America in 2002, as reported by the Center for Disease Control.Now, 17 years later, the disease is back with a vengeance and one state is taking a major hit. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, in 2017, there have been 75 cases of measles concentrated in only 4 counties of Minnesota:66 in Hennepin County3 in Ramsey County4 in Crow Wing County2 in Le Sueur County72 of the victims are under 17 years old.This year, Minnesota has had more cases than the whole of the United States combined and the CDC is blaming it all to one thing ... vaccinations.As reported by the state's health department, 92 percent of the people who contracted the disease were confirmed to be unvaccinated. Kristen Ehresmann, director of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Prevention, and Control Division at the state's Department of Health, told CNN, ""Many of the cases could have been prevented if people had gotten vaccinated.""She would prefer to invest funds in preventing measles than fighting it and explained that the disease can cause permanent damage to the brain and lungs. Ehresmann noted that there really is no plan b to the vaccine and said: ""There is no antiviral medicine against measles. All we can do is provide IV fluids, oxygen and support and hope they survive.""She urged people to ""not listen to false messages from anti-vaccine groups,"" and reiterated that not vaccinating your child is ""to put your child at risk.""Measles is highly contagious because to be exposed to the disease, all you have to do is breathe the same air as someone who already has it.The outbreak is believed to have started in a Somali community about a decade ago when members of the community felt Somali children were more prone to autism than white children. Fox News reported that anti-vaccine groups brought to the community the now-discredited research by British researcher Andrew Wakefield, that vaccines may be a cause of autism. Since then, Ehresmann noted that vaccine rates have plummeted within the Somali community, and the Minnesota health department reported, 84 percent of people who contracted measles were of Somali ethnicity. Although Ehresmann reiterated catching measles ""has nothing to do with being Somali,"" and everything to do with being unvaccinated.Challenges seem rife with this outbreak and the timing couldn't have been worse. Ramadan will conclude on [34 Jun 2017] with a large feast, which has the potential to be a prime breeding ground for spreading the virus.As part of a continual prevention program, Ehresmann reached out to the mosques and was reassured by imams that they will propagate the message that if you have measles, you should isolate yourself.[Byline: Jenni Fink]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There has been tremendous harm done by the discredited study by A Wakefield falsely demonstrating a link between autism and measles. That this report should have so much more influence than accurate reports of validated scientific studies showing no evidence of a connection between the 2 is very unfortunate.

Both a-Zouabi and Farouh are regional coordinators for the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN), a public health organization tracking epidemics in opposition-held areas of Syria.The 1st signs of the recent measles outbreak appeared in March [2017] in rebel-held Quneitra, a southwestern province bordering the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. At the time, medical professionals in the opposition-controlled areas of Daraa had only documented a handful of suspected measles cases, said a-Zouabi.But since that time, measles symptoms spread to the eastern and western Daraa countryside due, at least in part, to overcrowding and internal displacement in rebel-held areas of the province. The main reason for the outbreak is that most infants and young children in opposition areas of the province are not vaccinated.Only 2 doses of the measles vaccine are necessary to properly immunize children against the viral disease: the 1st during infancy and the 2nd at 4 -- 6 years of age.Measles disproportionately affects young children, and often with a fever, rash and potentially lethal complications that can be prevented by immunization.Children who are already symptomatic cannot be given a vaccine, and antiviral treatment does not currently exist for measles. This means that doctors can only resort to palliative measures such as painkillers, antipyretics and IV fluids to ensure that the condition of patients does not worsen.""The measles vaccine reduces occurrence of this potentially fatal viral infection by more than 99 percent, with children the primary victims of this wholly preventable disease,"" Dr. Homer Venters, an epidemiologist and Physicians for Human Rights' director of operations, told Syria Direct on [Mon 5 Jun 2017].Since the outbreak of the Syrian war in 2011, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) has documented the spread of disease, attacks on medical personnel and infrastructure and reports of chemical weapons use across the country. ""Death and disability from measles infection is a stark reminder that armed conflict harms health beyond the impact of bullets and bombs,"" the doctor added.The recent outbreak of measles ""boils down to the shortcomings of vaccination programs, which are still controlled by the Syrian regime's Ministry of Health,"" said pediatrician Farouh.Vaccines must be administered by a trained professional and require specific conditions for storage and distribution. In Syria, the Ministry of Health organizes vaccination campaigns with the assistance of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). But the government ministry retains control over areas and quantities of vaccine distribution, and SARC requires regime permission to enter any opposition-held areas.The Ministry of Health launched an anti-measles campaign on [21 May 2017] aimed at vaccinating ""children between 7 months and 5 years of age,"" state news agency SANA reported at the time. But the campaign was too late to stop the spread of the infection in the opposition-held south, and only a small quantity of vaccines entered the Daraa countryside, said a-Zouabi.The vaccination campaign did not provide any mobile teams and only set up distribution stations in a small number of health centers, the pediatrician added. ""Those who didn't hear [about the campaign] were once again deprived of their right to vaccines."" The last time Daraa residents had access to the measles vaccine--prior to last month's campaign--was in May 2015, said both a-Zouabi and al-Farouh.Syria Direct contacted the Damascus branch of the World Health Organization for details about vaccine distribution in opposition-areas. The office did not comment.In his clinic in the eastern Daraa countryside, a-Zouabi distributes Vitamin A supplements to any patients displaying symptoms of measles. He sends serum samples to a laboratory established by the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN), the public health program a-Zouabi works with, last month [May 2017].""With each new case that comes to the health center, we are overcome with worry and fear that it will be confirmed as a measles infection,"" he says.For a 35-year-old male resident of the rebel-held east countryside, the physicians at his local hospital confirmed that his 2 daughters, who are not vaccinated, had contracted the viral infection last month [May 2017]. Physicians at a hospital in the eastern Daraa town of al-Hirak confirmed the presence of the disease with a blood test. They gave him vitamins and medicine for fever and diarrhea for his daughters--ages 2 and 8 months.""I tried to isolate my daughters as well as I could, as the hospital staff instructed me,"" he told Syria Direct on [Mon 5 Jun 2017]. ""I live in 1 house with 3 other families"" the father said. ""I'm scared that this infection cannot be contained.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The situation in Syria is tragic, and one can only hope the world will respond to the needs of the children to protect them against vaccine preventable diseases, which should be achievable.A map of  Syria can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>. - Mod.LK]******[6] IsraelDate: Mon 5 Jun 2017, 9:38 AMSource: Israel National News [edited]<http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/230561>In recent weeks, 5 cases of measles have been reported to Israel's Health Ministry - all of them in Jerusalem. All 5 cases were women ages 20-40. No other cases of measles have been reported.Measles is a highly contagious disease characterized by a fever, rash, and eye infection. It may also cause severe complications. The MMR vaccine (which does not cause autism, but which was feared due to rumors that it does so) is given at 1 year of age and again at age 6.Most cases of preventable vaccines originate in non-vaccinated people. The Health Ministry calls on Israelis to ensure their children are vaccinated on schedule. Those children who have missed vaccinations should contact the ministry and receive them as soon as possible.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This report is sparse on details, but adds to the reports on the worldwide distribution of measles cases this year.A map of Israel can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>. - Mod LK]
