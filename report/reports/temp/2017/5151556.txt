As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent, than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance of that in the Republic of the Congo. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ sp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_.ProMED thanks Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for submitting this report.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Republic of Congo can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/166>and Central African Republic at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/66> - Mod.TY]
