KazTag [edited]<http://www.kaztag.kz/en/news/detail.php?ID=534086>More than 1000 head of cattle have been found infected with brucellosis in the East [sic, should read West, see comment] Kazakhstan oblast; this was revealed by Kazbek [Tashimov], head of the regional veterinary department.He remarked: ""the size of sick cattle is going down every year. For instance the index (percentages) was 1.8 in 2014, 1.4 in 2015, last year [2016] it was a little higher than 1 per cent,"" he said. He said some farmers do not put the cattle on the register; as a result, one sick head can infect dozens of others. ""We apply blood tests in spring and autumn. The cattle found infected with brucellosis are slaughtered,"" he said.--communicated by:Anton van Engelenfreelance livestock consultant[According to the Russian-language website ""Kazakh-zerno"", Kazakhstan, similarly dated [Wed 12 Apr 2017] (machine-translated), Kazbek Tashimov has disclosed 3 human brucellosis infections in West Kazakhstan since the start of the year [2017]. (He did not refer to the species of the agent responsible for the cases, which may be either _Brucella abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, both known to be endemic in Kazakhstan). Tashimov referred only to cattle and named several affected locations, indicating that one of the main reasons for the outbreaks was uncontrolled movement of cattle, including purchase of animals from other regions without the owners registering the introduced animals. It was further stated that West Kazakhstan received, as of the report date, 2.8 million doses of animal vaccines, including about 350 000 doses of nodular dermatitis (lumpy skin disease) vaccine. For the said and additional information, subscribers are referred to <http://kazakh-zerno.kz/novosti/agrarnye-novosti-kazakhstana/235379-zapadnyj-kazakhstan-tri-zhitelya-zarazilis-brutsellezomat> (in Russian).In the English source, there was some confusion between West and East Kazakhstan being the site of the discussed brucellosis events. According to the Russian source cited above, the brucellosis events in the current discussion are definitely located in the West Kazakhstan oblast (situated in north west Kazakhstan; map at <http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/kazakhstan-administrative-map.htm>).According to Kazakhstan's annual reports to the OIE since 2010, both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ circulate there though no quantitative figures are disclosed. Control measures against both reportable zoonoses, as checked for the period Jan 2010 - Jun 2016, include, among others, ""vaccination prohibited"". Controlling brucellosis without vaccination, relying solely on strict zoosanitary measures including periodical tests of registered, identified individual animals, is a complex and costly (compensations!) undertaking. If eradication of _B. melitensis_ in small ruminants, in endemic situation, is considered, it is difficult to envisage success without the initial application of vaccine during the 1st stages of the project.According to Kazakhstan's OIE reports, a decline in the number of human brucellosis has been noted since 2010: the number of reported human cases in 2011 was 1800; in 2013, 1443 cases and in 2015, 884 cases.In view of the above information on lumpy skin disease vaccination in West Kazakhstan, an update on the situation of this disease in Kazakhstan would be useful. Similarly, it would be useful to obtain updated results of (hopefully applied) targeted surveillance addressing peste des petits ruminants, an emerging disease in Kazakhstan's neighbors.The livestock population of Kazakhstan (2015 figures) includes about 6 million cattle and more than 18 million sheep. - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56>.]
