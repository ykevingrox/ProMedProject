Cleveland 19 News[edited]<http://www.cleveland19.com/story/35944969/2-e-coli-cases-confirmed-at-geauga-county-summer-camp>Gates are closed at Plast Camp in Geauga County as the health district begins their investigation to try to figure out why kids at the summer camp suddenly got sick. Health District Commissioner Robert Weisdack said there are 2 confirmed _E. coli_ cases, but a handful of other kids also said they didn't feel well and more tests are being done to see if other kids have _E. coli_.University Hospitals Dr Aaron Lareau said there are _E. coli_ signs to watch out for. ""Diarrhea, cramping of the stomach. Occasionally in cases where people are more ill you can see high fever, blood in the stool. In rare cases it can become a pretty severe illness,"" he said.Lareau said _E. coli_ is a bacterial infection that can travel quickly, especially in cases where there are a lot of kids who might not always be the cleanest at camp. The kids are sleeping in tents and swimming outside.Right now, the health district doesn't know where the infection came from. They closed the swimming pool, but workers said the bacterium could be in the water wells or food. ""The most important thing you can do is good hand hygiene and try to keep foods well washed and avoid any kind of questionable water source,"" said Lareau. ""It's a little gross to say, but it's probably coming from contaminated water from stool, either from animals or from humans, possibly related to poor hygiene.""More than 200 kids went to Plast Camp, ranging in age from 6 to 18 years old.Cleveland 19 News called Plast Camp, but workers directed questions to the Geauga County Health District. They said they hope to have more answers by the end of next week. Camp workers handed out fact sheets to the parents who picked their kids up. Friday night, 21 Jul 2017, health district said about 30 kids were still at the camp. They expect all kids to be out by the next day so they can go in next week [week of 24 Jul 2017] and investigate.[Byline: Shelby Miller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Fri 21 Jul 2017Source: Food Poisoning Journal [edited]<http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/plast-camp-hit-by-e-coli/#.WXSy6ojyuUk>According to press reports, Plast Camp in Middlefield, Ohio is closed after 2 confirmed cases of _E. coli_.
