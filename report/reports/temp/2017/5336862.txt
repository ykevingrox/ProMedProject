[Byline: Fatima Mohammed-Lawal]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The yellow fever (YF) diagnosed is now laboratory confirmed. Fortunately, the 2 patients are stable and reported to be on the road to recovery, and no additional reports of YF have been reported in the areas where the 2 patients acquired their YF virus infections. There is no further information about the test results of the 38 blood samples collected from individuals in some nearby communities. The previous report indicated that mosquitoes are common in the area, but the critical question that remains is whether _Aedes aegypti_ are present and these cases were infected in the urban cycle of transmission or from spill-over from the sylvan cycle transmitted by forest mosquitoes or those of rural areas.
