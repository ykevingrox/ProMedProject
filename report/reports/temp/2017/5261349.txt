While speaking with newsmen in Lokoja, Audu said those diagnosed were suffering from gastroenteritis and malaria. ""The current information available to us is that the strange disease actually started 6 weeks ago in Okoloke village in Yagba West, which is a settlement that is predominantly inhabited by Fulani herdsmen.""There have been cases of reported deaths following abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, but the patients who showed signs of illness had since been evacuated and transported to Kogi State Specialist Hospital, Lokoja for better treatment. So far, we have evacuated 39 patients from Okoloke area and only 6 of them were admitted and have shown significant sign of improvement while others have since been discharged.""Out of the 6 that were admitted, 3 of them were diagnosed of gastroenteritis and the remaining 3 were just cases of malaria, and they have shown remarkable signs of improvement,"" Audu said. He also stressed that the disease was not Lassa fever, saying the result of samples taken from the patients to Irua General Hospital for investigation proved negative. ""We will investigate and trace the dead people to the grave yard and come up with the correct figure.""We want to assure the general public that government is doing all that is humanly possible to stay on top of the situation and forestall further loss of lives. We will continue to inform the public as the investigation progresses,'' Audu said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 17 Aug 2017Source: Channels Television [edited]<https://www.channelstv.com/2017/08/17/mysterious-illness-kills-62-in-kogi/>An unknown illness has thrown many families in Kogi State into mourning and left health authorities with a puzzle to solve. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Saka Audu, told Channels Television that so far, 62 people have been killed by the illness which was initially thought to have been Lassa fever by many people. This is because it has some symptoms that are similar to Lassa fever such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The worst hit community is Okoloke in Yagba West Local Government Area of the state. Other areas are Okunran and Isanlu-Esa - both villages in Yagba West LGA.With over 60 people dead and Lassa fever ruled out as a cause, the government has taken samples of the disease and is hoping to identify the illness as quickly as possible to prevent more deaths, according to the commissioner.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There is some disagreement regarding the numbers occurring in this outbreak and it is not stated in the posting how many individuals overall became ill so it can be ascertained the approximate case-fatality rate, which can be helpful in the development of a differential diagnosis. It is also not specifically stated if the individuals were febrile or not, had any hemorrhagic features, over what period the illnesses occurred and if there was evidence of person-to-person spread. Gastrointestinal symptoms can be non-specific and reflect a more systemic illness such as malaria or meningitis. Indeed, the initially undiagnosed outbreak this year [2017] in Liberia was eventually confirmed to be meningococcal meningitis. Non-infectious etiologies include poisonings or biological toxins.Kogi is a state in the central region of Nigeria (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogi_State>).
