NHS Dumfries and Galloway said ""a small number of cases"" of the bacteria have been found in those involved in the Tough Mudder event at Drumlanrig Castle in June 2017. It has advised anyone associated with the event who experiences symptoms to seek medical advice.A spokesman for the health board said: ""NHS Dumfries and Galloway can confirm that we are aware of a small number of cases of _E. coli_ O157 across Scotland that appear to be associated with participation in the Tough Mudder event which was held at Drumlanrig Castle on [17 and 18 Jun 2017].""Any activity undertaken on agricultural land inevitably involves a small risk of gastrointestinal infection."" Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps or fever. The health board said people usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected, but they can take anything up to 14 days to develop.The endurance course is described by organizers as ""probably the toughest event on the planet"" and involves 20 obstacles over a 10-12 mile course. About 11 500 people took part in 2017.A spokesman for the event said: ""The safety of Tough Mudder participants, spectators, volunteers and staff is our number one priority. Tough Mudder is aware of the situation in Scotland and is working closely with local authorities. We are sorry to hear that Tough Mudder participants are unwell and wish them a full and speedy recovery.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail has previously reported on a 2012 outbreak of campylobacteriosis related to a similar event in Nevada (Campylobacteriosis - USA (02): (NV) race participants, 2012 Archive Number: 20140501.2443247). With exposure to a lot of the environment and mud in an agricultural setting, it is not surprising that zoonotic enteric pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ in this case but also campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis might occur. Since EHEC can have an incubation period which is longer than most bacterial enteric pathogens, participants who may have come from long distances may then present there.Tough Mudder (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tough_Mudder>) is an endurance event series in which participant's attempt 10-12 mile-long (16-19 km) obstacle courses that test mental as well as physical strength. The obstacles often play on common human fears, such as fire, water, electricity and heights. The main principle of the Tough Mudder revolves around teamwork. The Tough Mudder organization values camaraderie throughout the course, designing obstacles that encourage group participation. Participants must commit to helping others complete the course, putting teammates before themselves, and overcoming fears.- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/280>.]
