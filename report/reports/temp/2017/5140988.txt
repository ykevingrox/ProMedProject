The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, with viruses that originate in wild mammals of particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and SARS). Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population within a species range--which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.][See full article and references in the Nature publication referred to above. - Mod.LK]July 2017.

The Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa during 2013-2016 demonstrated the need to improve Ebola virus disease (EVD) diagnostics and standards of care. This retrospective study compared laboratory values and clinical features of 3 nonhuman primate models of lethal EVD to assess associations with improved survival time. In addition, the study identified laboratory values useful as predictors of survival, surrogates for EBOV viral loads, and triggers for initiation of therapeutic interventions in these nonhuman primate models. Furthermore, the data support that, in nonhuman primates, the Makona strain of EBOV may be less virulent than the Kikwit strain of EBOV. The applicability of these findings as potential diagnostic and management tools for EVD in humans warrants further investigation.]******[3] Non-governmental organization17 Jun 2017.

Alleghany College. <https://dspace.allegheny.edu/handle/10456/42901>Abstract. The purpose of this project is to identify what was the most given type of aid by non-government organizations (NGOs) was in response to the 2013-2015 [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreak in the countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The types of aid were split into 20 separate categories. Data was collected on 67 NGOs who were listed on The Center for International Disaster Information's website. The actual data was retrieved from the websites and affiliate sites of the NGOs being examined. The format of the data was usually self-reported, and was in other varying formats depending on the organizations. The data was then put into a spreadsheet on Microsoft Excel for analysis. It was determined at the end of the study that providing community education to communities who were at risk of coming into contact with the virus, or who already had been affected by the virus, was the most frequently given type of aid by NGOs. Several other areas of aid that had large contributions of aid were training healthcare workers and providing personal protective equipment. Several patterns were also found within the community education data regarding how the community education was provided or supplemented. It was found that many NGOs also made use of pamphlets and radio messages to educate populations about the virus. ]******[4] Vaccines19 Jun 2017: Ebola vaccine developed in Canada shows promising results<https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/cmaj-evd061317.php>[A phase 1 randomized controlled trial has found an Ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccine, developed in Canada, was well-tolerated with no safety concerns, and high antibodies were present in participants 6 months after immunization. The study, led by Canadian researchers, is published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal):Citation. ElSherif M.S., Brown C., MacKinnon-Cameron M., et al.

CMAJ June 19, 2017. 189(24) doi: 10.1503/cmaj.170074Abstract.--Background. The 2013-2016 Ebola virus [disease] outbreak in West Africa was the most widespread in history. In response, a live attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing Zaire Ebolavirus glycoprotein (rVSVÌ ""G-ZEBOV-GP) was evaluated in humans.--Methods. In a phase 1, randomized, dose-ranging, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy adults aged 18-65 years were randomized into 4 groups of 10 to receive one of 3 vaccine doses or placebo. Follow-up visits spanned 180 days post-vaccination for safety monitoring, immunogenicity testing and any rVSV virus shedding.--Results. Forty participants were injected with rVSV-deltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (n = 30) or saline placebo (n = 10). No serious adverse events related to the vaccine or participant withdrawals were reported. Solicited adverse events during the 14-day follow-up period were mild to moderate and self-limited, with the exception of injection-site pain and headache. Viremia following vaccination was transient and no longer detectable after study day 3, with no virus shedding in saliva or urine. All vaccinated participants developed serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), as measured by Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunogenicity was comparable across all dose groups, and sustained IgG titers were detectable through to the last visit, at study day 180.--Interpretation. In this phase 1 study, there were no safety concerns after a single dose of rVSV-deltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine. IgG ELISA showed persistent high titers at 180 days postimmunization. There was a period of reactogenicity, but in general, the vaccine was well tolerated. This study provides evidence of the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV-deltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine and importance of its further investigation.]14 Mar 2017 Ebola vaccine has been shown to induce a durable immune response 1 year after vaccination<http://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/128465_en.html?WT.mc_id=RSS-Feed?WT.rss_f=news&WT.rss_a=128465&WT.rss_ev=a>[A prime-boost Ebola vaccine regime has induced a persistent antibody response of at least one year in 100 percent of the healthy volunteers.

The Ebola virus vaccine strategies evaluated by the World Health Organization in response to the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa included a heterologous primary and booster vaccination schedule of the adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Tai Forest viruses nucleoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo).
