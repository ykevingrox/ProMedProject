Millennium Post [edited]<http://www.millenniumpost.in/nation/monkey-fever-claims-2-lives-in-maharashtra-215677>The outbreak of monkey fever [Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD)] has claimed 2 lives in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra this month [February 2017], despite the administration undertaking large scale vaccination drives to prevent the infection. ""The victims are the 1st casualties of the season as the viral infection is intensified during the December to May period.A total of 43 patients from 15 villages, mostly in the southern part of the district, are infected with this fever,"" Yogesh Sale, Sindhudurg district health officer said on [Sat 18 Feb 2017]. Cases of monkey fever were first reported in February last year [2016] in Maharashtra, wherein 7 patients had succumbed to the disease.The district health office undertook a massive drive a couple of months back in December [2016] and January [2017] during which 2842 people were vaccinated as a preventive measure.The booster dose will be given in May and June [2017] to improve the immunity of patients. However, despite all these measures, the infection claimed 2 lives this month [February 2017],"" Sale said. This time, the infection spread to more areas. Of the 43 cases so far, 20 are from Dodamarg tehsil, while the remaining are from Sawantwadi taluka. The administration has supplied insect repellents to villages falling in high risk areas, he said.""The villages located inside the forest or are very close to the forest areas are catgeorised as high-risk areas.The villagers have also been asked to report if they find a dead monkey in their area. The health department has started sprinkling malathion powder to keep the ticks away from human contact,"" the officer said. The infection, which starts with high fever and body ache, results in haemorrhage, similar to that in dengue. It has a mortality rate of 5 per cent to 10 per cent, said a state level medical officer.The Maharashtra government has procured 7500 injectable doses to vaccinate high-risk individuals, including farmers and forest workers, to prevent the tick-borne viral infection from spreading to other parts of the state.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As per the media report above, 2 deaths and 43 cases of KFD were reported in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra as of 18 Feb 2017.

So far in 2017, 39 positive cases have been reported in Thirthahalli taluk. On [16 Feb 2017], the blood samples of [a 65-year-old man] from Indira Nagar village in Kudumallige Gram Panchayat [village] limits, was tested positive for KFD at the National Institute of Virology, Pune, after he died of high fever. With this, the KFD death toll in the taluk this year [2017] stands at 3. The 1st 2 deaths were in Chiduva and Bekse-Kenjigudde villages.Taluk Health Officer Kiran SK told The Hindu that 5 persons infected with KFD have been admitted to the special ward at JC Government Hospital in Thirthahalli town, and thr3ee to the McGann Hospital in Shivamogga [district capital]. As there are chances of a relapse, the health condition of those who were hospitalised and discharged later is also being closely monitored, he said. ASHA [accredited social health activist] workers are visiting such patients regularly, he said.With [the patient's] blood sample testing positive, the vaccination drive has been intensified in and around Indira Nagar. The residents venturing out to the forest to graze cattle and collect firewood and those working in agricultural fields located on forest fringes have been asked to apply dimethyl phthalate oil, which acts as a tick repellent on the body, Mr Kiran said.Meanwhile, the spate of death of monkeys due to KFD has continued. On [17 Feb 2017], 3 monkeys died in the forest adjacent to Salur village and one monkey each in Aralasurali and Tenginakoppa [Karnataka]. There was intense bleeding from the mouth and rectal portions of these monkeys. Their blood and viscera samples have been sent for lab analyses. The places where they were found dead are being considered as vulnerable areas. The residents of Salur, Aralasurali and Tenginakoppa villages are being vaccinated against KFD.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[KFD is endemic in Karnataka state. Other than Karnataka state, antibodies against KFDV have also been detected in humans in Maharashtra state, in several parts of Gujarat state, and in isolated localities like Ramtek (near Nagpur), Kingaon, and Parbatpur of West Bengal state of India (<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7070563_Kyasanur_Forest_Disease_An_Epidemiological_View_in_India>).A district map of Karnataka can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/karnataka/karnataka.htm>.Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), popularly known as monkey fever, is caused by the Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ belonging to the family _Flaviviridae_. The KFDV was first isolated from sick monkeys captured in Kyasanur Forest, Shimoga district, Karnataka state; hence its name.The KFD virus (KFDV) is maintained by ticks, mammals, and bird cycles. The black-faced langur (_Presbytis entellus_) and the red-faced bonnet monkey (_Macaca radiate_) act as sentinel animals, as they are very susceptible to KFDV, as humans are (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545326/>).To prevent KFD in the local population, there is a need to create awareness of how to avoid tick bites and that KFD vaccination facilities be available in the affected areas. KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD.Vaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been reported (Kiran et al, 2015). The National Institute of Virology, Pune, has developed an inactivated chick embryo tissue culture vaccine against KFD (<http://www.icmr.nic.in/pinstitute/niv/KYASANUR%20FOREST%20DISEASE.pdf>). Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination. Thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area (Kasabi et al, 2013). - Mod.UBA]
