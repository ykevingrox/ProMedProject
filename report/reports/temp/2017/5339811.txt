Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/vibrio-five-cases-reported-tampa-bay-area-80677/>Florida state health officials have reported 23 _Vibrio vulnificus_ cases in 2017 through mid-September and of this total, 5 cases have been seen in the Tampa Bay area. Cases of the bacterial infection have been recorded in Hillsborough (2), Pinellas (1), Pasco (1) and Polk (1) counties. No deaths have been seen in the region. Of the 23 cases statewide, 3 deaths have been recorded-one each in Santa Rosa, Orange and Brevard Counties. In 2016, Florida reported 46 cases, including 10 deaths.People can get infected with _Vibrio vulnificus_ when they eat raw shellfish, particularly oysters. The bacterium is frequently isolated from oysters and other shellfish in warm coastal waters during the summer months. Since it is naturally found in warm marine waters, people with open wounds can be exposed to _V. vulnificus_ through direct contact with seawater. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of the organism._Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacterium. Ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. _V. vulnificus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulcers. Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease. The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time.A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people. Wound infections may also be serious in people with weakened immune systems. The wound may heal poorly and require surgery. Sometimes amputation may even be needed for recovery.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book"", Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.""The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.]
