Delish.com [edited]<http://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a52762/campylobacter-food-poisoning/>The commonest germ to cause food poisoning in the USA is officially no longer salmonella. Campylobacter, a bug often found in unpasteurized dairy products and contaminated chicken, is now the no.1 culprit, according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] last Thursday, 20 Apr 2017.Campylobacter, which can also be founded in contaminated water and produce, beat out salmonella, which [has been] the no.1 cause for the past 20 years. Other top causes included listeria, shigella and _Escherichia coli_. While CDC's report only counts cases in 10 states, it is considered to be a good indicator of food poisoning trends across the country.Food poisoning isn't getting any worse in the USA, but it's not exactly getting any better. While 24 000 illnesses and 98 deaths were reported in the 10 states in 2016, only about 1 in 6 Americans get sick from food poisoning each year, a rate that has stayed the same for the past 3 years, according to CDC.The good news is that salmonellosis is on the decline thanks to tighter regulations and the vaccination of chickens. But make sure to keep cooking your food thoroughly at home, and don't forget to wash your spinach and lettuce properly. According to the government report, leafy greens were the no.1 source of food poisoning and accounted for nearly half of all illnesses.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The CDC report, shown below, is a snapshot (7 states and selected counties in 3 other states) of foodborne infection, which does not count cases due to most bacterial toxin-related illnesses, such as those due to _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Clostridium perfringens_ and _Bacillus cereus_. - Mod.LL]******[2]Date: Fri 21 Apr 2017Source: MMWR Morb Mortal Week Rep 2017; 66(15): 397-403 [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6615a1.htm?s_cid=mm6615a1_w>Incidence and trends of infections with pathogens transmitted commonly through food and the effect of increasing use of culture-independent diagnostic tests on surveillance -- Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, 10 US sites, 2013-2016--------------------------------------------Foodborne diseases represent a substantial public health concern in the USA. CDC's Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) monitors cases reported from 10 USA sites (Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, and selected counties in California, Colorado, and New York) of laboratory-diagnosed infections caused by 9 enteric pathogens commonly transmitted through food. This report describes preliminary surveillance data for 2016 on the 9 pathogens and changes in incidences compared with 2013-2015.In 2016, FoodNet identified 24 029 infections, 5512 hospitalizations, and 98 deaths caused by these pathogens. The use of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) by clinical laboratories to detect enteric pathogens has been steadily increasing since FoodNet began surveying clinical laboratories in 2010 (1). CIDTs complicate the interpretation of FoodNet surveillance data because pathogen detection could be affected by changes in health care provider behaviors or laboratory testing practices (2). Health care providers might be more likely to order CIDTs because these tests are quicker and easier to use than traditional culture methods, a circumstance that could increase pathogen detection (3). Similarly, pathogen detection could also be increasing as clinical laboratories adopt DNA-based syndromic panels, which include pathogens not often included in routine stool culture (4,5). In addition, CIDTs do not yield isolates, which public health officials rely on to distinguish pathogen subtypes, determine antimicrobial resistance, monitor trends, and detect outbreaks. To obtain isolates for infections identified by CIDTs, laboratories must perform reflex cultures; if clinical laboratories do not, the burden of culturing falls to state public health laboratories, which might not be able to absorb that burden as the adoption of these tests increases (2). Strategies are needed to preserve access to bacterial isolates for further characterization and to determine the effect of changing trends in testing practices on surveillance.FoodNet is a collaboration among CDC, 10 state health departments, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Food and Drug Administration. FoodNet personnel conduct active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed infections caused by campylobacter, cryptosporidium, cyclospora, listeria, salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing [enterohemorrhagic] _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC), shigella, vibrio, and yersinia for 10 sites covering about 15 per cent of the US population (an estimated 49 million persons in 2015). Confirmed bacterial infections are defined as isolation of the bacterium from a clinical specimen by culture. Confirmed parasitic infections are defined as detection of the parasite from a clinical specimen by direct fluorescent antibody test, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme immunoassay, or light microscopy. CIDTs detect bacterial pathogen antigen, nucleic acid sequences, or for EHEC, Shiga toxin or Shiga toxin genes, in a stool specimen or enrichment broth. A CIDT positive-only bacterial infection is a positive CIDT result that was not confirmed by culture. Hospitalizations occurring within 7 days of specimen collection are recorded. The patient's vital status at hospital discharge (or 7 days after specimen collection if not hospitalized) is also recorded. Hospitalizations and deaths occurring within 7 days of specimen collection are attributed to the infection.FoodNet also conducts surveillance for physician-diagnosed postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potential complication of EHEC infection, by review of hospital discharge data through a network of nephrologists and infection preventionists. This report includes HUS cases among persons aged under 18 years for 2015, the most recent year with available data.Incidence of infection for each pathogen is calculated by dividing the number of infections in 2016 by the US Census estimates of the surveillance area population for 2015. Incidence is calculated for confirmed infections alone and for confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections combined. A negative binomial model with 95 per cent confidence intervals (CIs) was used to estimate changes in incidence of confirmed bacterial and parasitic infections and confirmed or CIDT positive-only bacterial infections in 2016 compared with 2013-2015, adjusting for changes in the surveillance population over time. For EHEC, incidence is reported for all EHEC serogroups combined because it is not possible to distinguish between serogroups using CIDTs. Insufficient data were available to assess change for cyclospora. For HUS, the 2015 incidence was compared with incidence during 2012-2014.Cases of infection, incidence, and trends-----------------------------------------During 2016, FoodNet identified 24 029 cases, 5512 hospitalizations, and 98 deaths caused by confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections (table 1 [see abstracted table below - Mod. LL]). The largest number of confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections in 2016 was reported for campylobacter (8547), followed by salmonella (8172), shigella (2913), EHEC (1845), cryptosporidium (1816), yersinia (302), vibrio (252), listeria (127), and cyclospora (55). The proportion of infections that were CIDT positive without culture confirmation in 2016 was largest for campylobacter (32 per cent) and yersinia (32 per cent), followed by EHEC (24 per cent), shigella (23 per cent), vibrio (13 per cent), and salmonella (8 per cent). The overall increase in CIDT positive-only infections for these 6 pathogens in 2016 was 114 per cent (range = 85 per ent -1432 per cent) compared with 2013-2015. Among infections with a positive CIDT result in 2016, a reflex culture was attempted on about 60 per cent at either a clinical or state public health laboratory. The proportion of attempted reflex cultures differed by pathogen, ranging from 45 per cent for campylobacter to 86 per cent for EHEC and 88 per cent for vibrio (figure: see original URL. - Mod.LL). Among infections for which reflex culture was performed, the proportion of infections that were positive was highest for salmonella (88 per cent) and STEC (87 per cent), followed by shigella (64 per cent), yersinia (59 per dent), campylobacter (52 per cent), and vibrio (46 per cent).The incidence of confirmed infections and of confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections per 100 000 persons was highest for campylobacter (confirmed = 11.79; confirmed or CIDT positive-only = 17.43) and salmonella (15.40; 16.66), followed by shigella (4.60; 5.94), cryptosporidium (3.64; --), EHEC (2.85; 3.76), yersinia (0.42; 0.62), and lowest for vibrio (0.45; 0.51), listeria (0.26; N/A), and cyclospora (0.11; N/A) (table 2: see URL above. - Mod.SH). Compared with 2013-2015, the 2016 incidence of campylobacteriosis was significantly lower (11 per cent decrease) when including only confirmed infections, yet was not significantly different when including confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections. Incidence of EHEC infection was significantly higher for confirmed infections (21 per cent increase) and confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections (43 per cent increase). Similarly, the incidence of yersiniosis was significantly higher for both confirmed (29 per cent increase) and confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections (91 per cent increase). Incidence of confirmed cryptosporidium infection was also significantly higher in 2016 compared with 2013-2015 (45 per cent increase).Among 7554 confirmed salmonellosis in 2016, serotype information was available for 6583 (87 per cent). The commonest serotypes were Enteritidis (1320; 17 per cent), Newport (797; 11 per cent), and Typhimurium (704; 9 per cent). The incidence in 2016 compared with 2013-2015 was significantly lower for Typhimurium (18 per cent decrease; CI = 7-21) and unchanged for Enteritidis and Newport. Among 208 (95 per cent) speciated vibrio isolates, 103 (50 per cent) were _V. parahaemolyticus_, 35 (17 per cent) were _V. alginolyticus_, and 26 (13 per cent) were _V. vulnificus_. Among 1394 confirmed and serogrouped EHEC cases, 503 (36 per cent) were EHEC O157 and 891 (64 per cent) were EHEC non-O157. Among 586 (70 per cent) EHEC non-O157 isolates, the commonest serogroups were O26 (190; 21 per cent), O103 (178; 20 per cent), and O111 (106; 12 per cent). Compared with 2013-2015, the incidence of EHEC non-O157 infections in 2016 was significantly higher (26 per cent increase; CI = 9-46) and the incidence of EHEC O157 was unchanged.FoodNet identified 62 cases of postdiarrheal HUS in children aged under 18 years (0.56 cases per 100 000) in 2015; 33 (56 per cent) occurred in children aged under 5 years (1.18 cases per 100 000). Compared with 2012-2014, in 2015, no significant differences in incidence among all children or children aged under 5 years were observed.Discussion----------The number of CIDT positive-only infections reported to FoodNet has been increasing markedly since 2013, as more clinical laboratories adopt CIDTs. Initially, increases were primarily limited to campylobacter and EHEC; followed by substantial increases in salmonella and shigella beginning in 2015 (6). The pattern continued in 2016, with large increases in the number of CIDT positive-only vibrio and yersinia infections. When including both confirmed and CIDT positive-only infections, incidence rates in 2016 were higher for each of these 6 pathogens. The increasing use of CIDTs presents challenges when interpreting the corresponding increases in incidence. For example, the incidence of confirmed campylobacter infections in 2016 was significantly lower than the 2013-2015 average. However, when including CIDT positive-only infections, a slight but not significant increase occurred. For EHEC and yersinia, the incidence of confirmed infections alone and confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections in 2016 were both significantly higher than the 2013-2015 average; the magnitude of change approximately doubled when analyzing CIDT positive-only infections.Because of the ease and increasing availability of CIDTs, testing for some pathogens might be increasing as health care provider behaviors and laboratory practices evolve (2). Among clinical laboratories in the FoodNet catchment, the use of CIDTs to detect salmonella, for which the only CIDTs available are DNA-based gastrointestinal syndrome panels, increased from 2 per 460 laboratories (less than 1 per cent) in 2013 to 59 per 421 laboratories (14 per cent) in 2016 (FoodNet, unpublished data). This increased use paralleled significant increases in incidence of cryptosporidium, EHEC, and yersinia, and slight but not significant increases in incidence of campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, and vibrio, all of which are also included in these panel tests. The increase in EHEC incidence is driven by the increase in EHEC non-O157, which is not typically included in routine stool culture testing because it requires specialized methods. Routine stool cultures performed in clinical laboratories typically include methods that identify only salmonella, campylobacter, shigella, and for some laboratories, EHEC O157 (4,5). The increased use of the syndrome panel tests might increase identification, and thus, improve incidence estimates of pathogens for which testing was previously limited.Results are more quickly obtained using CIDTs than traditional culture methods (3). Because of this, health care providers might be more likely to order a CIDT than traditional culture (2). Increased testing might identify infections that previously would have remained undiagnosed. However, sensitivity and specificity vary by test type. Evaluations of DNA-based syndrome panel tests have indicated high sensitivity and specificity for most targets (3). However, among pathogens for which antigen-based CIDTs are often used, such as campylobacter and cryptosporidium, sensitivity and specificity have varied more widely, with a large number of false positive results (7,8). Including CIDT positive infections to calculate incidence, some of which could be false positives, might provide an inaccurate estimate. When interpreting incidence and trends in light of changing diagnostic testing, considering frequency of testing, sensitivity, and specificity of these tests is important. The observed increases in incidence of confirmed or CIDT positive-only infections in 2016 compared with 2013-2015 could be caused by increased testing, varying test sensitivity, an actual increase in infections, or a combination of these reasons.These changes in testing are also important to consider when monitoring progress toward Healthy People 2020 objectives. The current objectives were created before the use of CIDTs and were based on confirmed infections. In the future, just as incidence measures should adjust for these changes, objectives should also be evaluated in light of changing diagnostics.CIDTs pose additional challenges because they do not yield the bacterial isolates necessary for essential public health surveillance activities, such as monitoring trends in pathogen subtypes, conducting molecular testing, detecting outbreaks and implicating vehicles, and determining antimicrobial susceptibility. Reflex culture performed to yield an isolate places an additional burden on laboratories' budgets, personnel, and time. Specimen submission requirements differ by state and pathogen, and this responsibility often falls to state public health laboratories (9). As CIDT use increases and more pathogens are affected, state public health laboratories will be challenged to sufficiently increase their testing capacity and will likely have to prioritize specimens on which to perform reflex culture (10). Clinical laboratories should review state specimen submission requirements and the Association of Public Health Laboratories guidelines for reflex culture and submission of CIDT positive specimens.The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. 1st, the changing diagnostic landscape with unknown changes in frequency of testing, varying test performance, and decreasing availability of isolates for subtyping make interpreting incidence and trends more difficult. 2nd, changes in health care-seeking behavior, access to health services, or other population characteristics might have changed since the comparison period, which could affect incidence.Foodborne illness remains a substantial public health concern in the USA. Previous analyses have indicated that the number of infections far exceeds those diagnosed; CIDTs might be making those infections more visible (11). Most foodborne infections can be prevented, and substantial progress has been made in the past in decreasing contamination of some foods and reducing illness caused by some pathogens. More prevention measures are needed. Surveillance data can provide information on where to target these measures. However, to accurately interpret FoodNet surveillance data in light of changes in diagnostic testing, more data and analytic tools are needed to adjust for changes in testing practices and differences in test characteristics. FoodNet is collecting more data and developing those tools. With these, FoodNet will continue to track the needed progress toward reducing foodborne illness.Table 1: Number of confirmed and CIDT positive-only bacterial and confirmed parasitic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, by pathogen -- FoodNet, 10 US sites, 2016 (preliminary data)---------------------------------------------------------Pathogen: Confirmed / No. cases / Hospitalizations (per cent) / Deaths (per cent) // Confirmed or CIDT positive-only / No. cases / Hospitalizations (per cent) / Deaths (per cent) Bacteria--------Campylobacter: 5782 / 1082 (19) / 10 (0.2) // 8547 / 1697 (20) / 26 (0.3)Listeria: 127 / 123 (97) / 17 (13.4) // 127 / 123 (97) / 17 (13.4)Salmonella: 7554 / 2163 (29) / 39 (0.5) // 8172 / 2255 (28) / 40 (0.5)Shigella: 2256 / 519 (23) / 2 (0.1) // 2913 / 579 (20) / 2 (0.1)STEC: 1399 / 326 (23) / 3 (0.2) // 1845 / 408 (22) / 3 (0.2)Vibrio: 218 / 61 (28) / 4 (1.8) // 252 / 73 (29) / 4 (1.6)Yersinia: 205 / 54 (27) / 3 (1.5) // 302 / 83 (28) / 3 (1.0)Parasites---------Cryptosporidium: 1816 / 291 (16) / 3 (0.2) // 1816 / 291 (16) / 3 (0.2)Cyclospora: 55 / 3 (5) / 0 (--) // 55 / 3 (5) / 0 (--)Total: 19 412 / 4622 / 81 // 24 029 / 5512 / 98References----------1.

Whether campylobacteriosis has passed salmonellosis in the ""hit parade"" is a moot point. Both are common causes of bacterial foodborne illness, and both can be easily minimized by adequately cooking food and practicing appropriate kitchen hygiene.The use of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) is a boon to laboratorians but can delay the reporting of antimicrobial sensitivities for an organism such as salmonella. Back-up cultures are vital so that appropriate organisms can be forwarded to CDC to analyze for the possibility of matched organisms to link to an outbreak.The see also section below highlights some of the other causes of foodborne illness, including bacterial toxin-induced diseases related to _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Clostridium perfringens_ and _Bacillus cereus_.
