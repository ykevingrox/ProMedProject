The Jamestown Sun [edited]<http://www.jamestownsun.com/news/local/4247166-std-cases-increased-state-stutsman-county-last-year>Sexually transmitted diseases [STDs] are on the rise in North Dakota and Stutsman County, according to the North Dakota Department of Health.In North Dakota, 3457 cases of chlamydia were reported to the department in 2016, an 8.5 per cent increase from the previous year [2015]. The state also saw 1005 cases of gonorrhea, an almost 50 per cent increase from 2015, and 61 cases of syphilis, a 42 per cent increase, according to the department. North Dakota also had a 66 per cent increase in new diagnoses of HIV/AIDS from 2015 to 2016.The increases in Stutsman County are not quite at the level of the state, said Jennifer Schmidt, a Department of Health field epidemiologist located in Jamestown. Chlamydia cases in the county have been on the upswing for the last several years, Schmidt said. There were 46 cases in 2013, 73 in 2014, 52 in 2015 and 65 in 2016 in Stutsman County, she said. The county had less than 5 cases of gonorrhea per year until 2015, when there were 11, and 10 in 2016, Schmidt said. Even though it's not a large number, it is still a significant increase, she said. Syphilis is not recorded by the county because it has not been as high of an incident in the state, Schmidt said.Sarah Weninger, STD prevention coordinator for the North Dakota Department of Health, said there isn't a straightforward answer as to why the numbers are increasing. ""There could be more testing happening in communities and also more disease prevalence,"" Weninger said. ""It's important for people to get tested if they are at risk.""There is a conservative attitude in North Dakota about youth sex, but the reality is different, Weninger said. According to the Department of Public Instruction's 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, almost 50 per cent of high schoolers in the state have had sex. ""The reality is, it's happening and needs to be addressed appropriately,"" Weninger said. ""I don't think that's happening, and students are not being educated comprehensively enough."" Schmidt said there is room for education on how STDs are transmitted.[byline: Katie Fairbanks]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Stutsman County, with a population of 21 000 residents, is located in the central portion of the US state of North Dakota; its county seat is Jamestown (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stutsman_County,_North_Dakota>).

Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis -- 3 of the commonest STDs -- are becoming more prevalent in the state and nationally, especially among young people and minority groups more at risk, health officials say.Nearly 24 000 cases of chlamydia were reported to the state Department of Public Health in 2015, about 60 per cent more than a decade ago. ""The increase in chlamydia rates, especially among young people, is really alarming,"" said Jennifer Childs-Roshak, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. ""If it were anything else, I think it would be a public health crisis.""Gonorrhea infections have risen as well, with 3688 cases reported in 2015. That was a 52 per cent increase from 2006. Meanwhile, syphilis cases are also rising. In 2015, the state received word of 792 new cases, nearly 4 times the number reported in 2006.There's no consensus about what's causing a resurgence of diseases that a decade ago had leveled out, if not declined. Some health officials attribute it to more screenings that are revealing cases with few or no symptoms. Other officials suggest that younger people and other at-risk groups are ignoring the dangers of unprotected sex.Nearly 40 per cent of babies born to women with syphilis may be stillborn or die from the infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. Syphilis rates are rising among men and women, but disproportionately affect gay men. ""While most gay men are very clear about their risk for HIV infection, they may not be as clear about the risks for syphilis infection,"" Cranston said. ""It's made a very strong comeback.""The diseases are also spreading among young people reluctant to use condoms -- considered the most effective protection against STDs -- and who have sex with multiple partners, some health officials say. ""We continue to preach the use of condoms, but sometimes it feels like we're shoveling against the tide,"" said Dr Zandra Kelley, medical director at the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, which has clinics in Methuen, Haverhill and Lawrence. ""The use of condoms among young people is still largely frowned upon,"" she said.Kelley said a lack of sex education in schools also contributes to the problem. Health officials say sex ed programs that emphasize abstinence, such as the curriculum in Lawrence, contribute to the problem. The city had one of the highest rates of chlamydia in the state in 2015, with about 500 cases per 100 000 people. Rates for gonorrhea were also among the state's highest. ""Our population is at a significantly higher risk than other parts of the state,"" Kelley said.High rates of STDs in Massachusetts and other New England states mirror trends nationally. Syphilis cases in the United States rose most sharply in the past year [2016?], by 19 per cent, according to CDC. Reported chlamydia cases grew 5.9 per cent, with more than 1.5 million cases last year, and gonorrhea cases increased 12 per cent to 395 216. While chlamydia disproportionately affects women, cases among men grew more sharply last year as well.Chlamydia rates are highest among those aged 15 to 24 years, who accounted for nearly two thirds of diagnoses last year [2016], and among black people, according to CDC. The growing popularity of dating apps could contribute to elevated rates as well, since they encourage sexual activity with multiple partners, the federal agency said.[byline: Christian M Wade]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Newburyport, Methuen, Haverhill and Lawrence are cities in Essex County, which is located in the north eastern part of the US state of Massachusetts and is part of the Greater Boston area (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_Massachusetts>).

To recognize sexually transmitted disease awareness month, the Iowa Department of Public Health released some new stats from 2016. It isn't pretty.There's been a 75 per cent increase in gonorrhea cases from 2013 to 2016. Syphilis had been steady for years but is now on the rise in the state, surging 450 per cent between 2011 and 2013. A total of 13 000 cases of chlamydia, the commonest reportable condition in Iowa, were reported in the state in 2016.The early indications from Black Hawk County aren't any better, said public health director Nafissa Cisse Egbuonye. After recent decreases, preliminary data for 2016 show the county has joined the state and the nation in seeing an uptick in rates for chlamydia and gonorrhea. That's discouraging news. Black Hawk County long has had the highest rates of those infections in the state per capita. In 2015, the most recent data available, the county's rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea per 100 000 were 631 cases and 204 cases, respectively; the next closest counties were Webster [County] with 587 cases of chlamydia and Woodbury with 160 cases of gonorrhea.""It's been a problem in Black Hawk County for a little over a decade, and probably going on 2 decades, so it's not new news, but it's still a concern that strategically still affects us,"" said former Black Hawk County public health director Bruce Meisinger. But a long-standing STI Coalition in the county is working with Cisse Egbuonye, who has been director for about 8 months, to tackle the issue anew. Cisse Egbuonye said the health department will use the 2016 data to figure out what caused rates to rise and to better target their efforts. ""We are doing more rigorous data analysis to be able to target very defined groups that are having these high rates and what are the interventions that need to be set in place so that they can get tested and receive treatment,"" Cisse Egbuonye said.[byline: Christinia Crippes]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Black Hawk County, with a population of 131 090 residents, is located in the north eastern part of the US state of Iowa (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa>).

At 42 per cent higher than the state average, Kern's chlamydia rate is the second highest in California, just behind San Francisco. Gonorrhea incidence rates in Kern County are 26 per cent higher than the state average, and 4 times higher than local rates reported in 1997. The rate increases for syphilis in Kern are even more shocking. Kern's syphilis incidence is 555 per cent higher than the state average, and third highest in California. The prevalence of congenital syphilis, when a mother passes the disease to her baby during pregnancy or birth, is 25 times higher than it was 5 years ago.

The 2016 Minnesota Department of Health's annual report found that syphilis cases rose by 30 per cent, gonorrhea 25 per cent and chlamydia cases increased by 7 per cent.Health professionals say the increase, part of a 4-year trend, is the result of a decline in condom use and a lack of education. ""It's not a huge surprise,"" said Krissie Guerard, MDH's STI/HIV and TB section manager. At the University of Minnesota, 52.5 per cent of students used a condom the last time they had vaginal intercourse, according to a 2015 Boynton Health survey.Syphilis infections rose by 58 per cent in greater Minnesota. There were also reports of infections in females of child-bearing age, though most infections are seen among males, particularly men who have sex with men. ""It's in broader communities now,"" Guerard said. ""It's a very large increase. Syphilis nationally is going back up compared to what it used to be."" People aged 13 to 25 and communities of color are the most likely to be infected with an STI, Karbeah said.

Argentina recorded an increase in syphilis cases, and health professionals warn about lack of care in sexual intercourse.According to the latest data from the Epidemiological Bulletin of the Ministry of Health, in Buenos Aires, the most populated province of the country, the increase was almost 30 per cent between 2015 and 2016. In CÌ rdoba, the increase was 19 per cent, in Santa Fe 15 per cent, Mendoza 55% per cent, Chubut 58 per cent and La Pampa 80 per cent.Meanwhile, some provinces recorded annual decreases, such as Entre RÌ os, which went from 263 cases to 259, Corrientes from 292 to 122, Chaco from 684 to 450, or Missions from 553 to 361.Although not all cases are reported, Omar Sued, director of clinical investigations of the HuÌ©sped Foundation, said that, in particular, he sees more infection than in [previous] years. In the same vein, Graciela Torales, head of infectology at the Alejandro Posadas National Hospital, agreed that there is an increase in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 5.6 million people get syphilis each year, and an estimated 357 million people are infected with any of the 4 STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, or trichomoniasis.To explain the increase in cases, the professionals explained that there is an increase in sex without a condom, while specifying that the highest rates of infection occur in young people, homosexual and trans [transsexuals]. ""There is a false sense of security in not using condoms because in recent years the fight against sexually transmitted diseases has improved,"" said the director of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) at the Ministry of Health, Sergio Maulen.Syphilis is produced by a bacterium called _Treponema pallidum_, which affects both males and females, and symptoms appear 2 or 3 weeks after unprotected sexual contact. To cure this disease, specialists recommend a single dose of benzathine penicillin, which is an antibiotic injected by a doctor or nurse into the muscle of the buttocks or thigh of the infected patient. Likewise, professionals said that the key to the problem is to reinforce work on prevention and education, especially in the use of condoms.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Argentina is a federal republic in the southern half of South America; it is subdivided into 23 provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina>).

It's no wonder, given that researchers have been seeing steadily increasing rates of the sexually transmitted disease (STD) in recent years. Because of this, CDC has issued a call to action, sharing with specific at-risk populations and healthcare providers alike what they can do to ""stem the tide"" (CDC call to action. Let's work together to stem the tide of rising syphilis in the United States; available at: <https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/SyphilisCalltoActionPRINT.pdf>).The rates of primary and secondary syphilis have increased by 19 per cent from 2014 to 2015. CDC notes that preliminary data are suggesting that there was a ""similar rate of increase in the first 6 months of 2016"". Although both men and women are experiencing increased rates of infection, a staggering 90 per cent of all primary and secondary syphilis cases are men. Furthermore, CDC reports that men who have sex with men (MSM) account for the majority (82 per cent) of male cases.In their call to action, CDC shared that ""increases in congenital syphilis (CS) have paralleled the national increase in primary and secondary syphilis among women of reproductive age."" In fact, from 2012 to 2015, rates of congenital syphilis increased each year.Although syphilis can result in several severe -- and sometimes deadly -- complications, it is arguably easy to prevent and, unlike other diseases such as HIV, with the right treatment, it can be cured. CDC reports that penicillin, first used to fight syphilis in 1943, remains the best drug available to fight the infection. The good news is the penicillin has remained effective in treating syphilis. The bad news? According to the CDC, ""It is the only known antibiotic to treat syphilis during pregnancy. So, for pregnant women with a severe allergy to penicillin, or when there is a drug shortage, there are no alternative treatment regimens to turn to. The rest of our treatment and prevention tools are outdated.""CDC also shared that the tests currently available are unable to confirm syphilis ""on the spot"" and that ""they require at least 2 sequential antibody tests in blood, rather than directly detecting the presence of syphilis-causing bacteria"". In addition, the results can be hard to interpret, which can result in a delay in needed treatment. Furthermore, these tests are not able to diagnose the infection in its early stages, underscoring the need for ""modernized test development"".CDC reports that there has been a ""sharp increase in the number of babies born with CS in the United States"". Women who have syphilis and have not been treated can pass the infection on to her fetus through the bloodstream at any syphilis stage. Perhaps more troubling is that 40 per cent of babies born to untreated women who have syphilis are stillborn or die from the infection. According to CDC, lack of prenatal care accounts for about one quarter of CS cases, but even with this care, ""detection and treatment of maternal syphilis often occur too late to prevent CS."" In fact, CDC reports that almost half, or 42 per cent of women who gave birth to an infant with CS had not been tested in time to prevent it.In addition, MSM account for the majority two thirds) of male primary and secondary syphilis cases. Although CDC recommends that MSM get tested on an annual basis, often they remain unscreened. CDC reports that, from 2011 to 2015, syphilis cases among MSM rose sharply by 56 per cent, and ""in 2015, the rate of syphilis in MSM was 106 times higher than the syphilis rate among men who have sex with only women."" CDC hopes that with increased screening, the numbers of MSM infected can be reduced.To this end, CDC has issued actions to be taken pertaining to the affected populations:- pregnant women: visit your doctor and get tested for syphilis. If you test positive during your pregnancy, make sure you receive treatment immediately. Make sure that you schedule follow-up visits with your doctor to ensure that you and your baby stay healthy.- gay, bisexual, and other MSM: talk to your doctor about your sexual history and get tested, not only for syphilis but for other STDs as well. Consider ways to protect yourself and your partner from infection, and remember to always use protection during sexual intercourse.The call to action also includes information for health care providers, public health departments, and decision makers and community leaders on how they can proactively reduce CS and syphilis among MSM. They also called on biomedical students, universities, and industry to channel their efforts into producing new tools that will strengthen syphilis prevention, detection, and treatment. For example, electronic medical record (EMR) developers should make sure that EMRs support syphilis screening and treatment.CDC is actively working to cut down on the numbers of infected women and babies and ""reverse the increasing trend"" of syphilis rates among MSM. Through awareness, collaboration, and action, we can ""stem the tide of rising syphilis in the United States"".[byline: Kristi Rosa]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[2015 was the secnd year in a row in which increases were seen in all 3 nationally reported STDs -- chlamydia, gonococcal disease and syphilis (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/std-surveillance-2015-print.pdf>). The approximately 1.5 million cases of chlamydia represent the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to CDC. Substantial increases were also seen among reported cases of gonorrhea and syphilis: During 2014-2015, the rate of reported gonorrhea increased 18.3 per cent among men and 6.8 per cent among women. Gonorrhea rates among both men and women increased in every region of the United States, with the largest increases in the west and the south. The magnitude of the increase among males suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (for example, through increased extra-genital screening) among MSM or both.The national rate of reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most infectious stages of the disease, had reached an historic low in 2000 and 2001, but has increased almost every year since then. During 2000-2014, the increased incidence of P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, MSM.However, during 2013-2014, the rate of P&S syphilis increased nationally not only among men (14.4 per cent), but the rate of P&S syphilis among women (22.7 per cent), which had been stable or falling, also increased. The overall male, and female P&S syphilis rates increased in every region of the country. Nationally, P&S syphilis rates increased in every age group between 15 and 44 years and in every race/ethnicity group except for Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders during 2013-2014 (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/syphilis.htm>). Preliminary data in the first 6 months of 2016 show similar trends (<https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/SyphilisCalltoActionPRINT.pdf>).The increase among women is particularly concerning because congenital syphilis cases tend to increase as the rate of P&S syphilis among women increases. In fact, after decreasing during 2008-2012 (from 10.5 to 8.4 reported cases per 100 000 live births), the rate of reported congenital syphilis increased in 2013 to 9.1 cases per 100 000 live births. During 2013-2014, the rate increased 27.5 per cent to 11.6 cases per 100 000 live births in 2014.As had been observed in previous years, in 2014, the rate of reported P&S syphilis cases among men (11.7 cases per 100 000 males) was much higher than the rate among women (1.1 cases per 100 000 females), and men accounted for a large majority (90.8 per cent) of P&S syphilis cases. Among P&S syphilis cases with known HIV-status in these states, 51.2 per cent of cases among MSM were HIV-positive, compared with 10.7 per cent of cases among men who have sex with women (MSW), and 5.9 per cent of cases among women.As can be seen from the see also's below, the rising incidence of STDs is an international issue. The reasons for these increases in incidence of STDs are varied and likely differ by locality and the patient population affected. Increased diagnostic testing for STDs could contribute to some extent to the increased incidence in some groups, such as MSM. Some of the factors that could promote unprotected sex include: lack of sex education and access to condoms for teenagers; the opioid epidemic and sale of sex for drugs; the popularity of cell phone geolocating dating apps that facilitate sexual activity with multiple anonymous partners; use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners; use of psychoactive ""party drugs""; and use among MSM of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a way to prevent HIV infection for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it by engaging in risky condomless sexual activity (<http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/PrEPguidelines2014.pdf>). - Mod.ML]
