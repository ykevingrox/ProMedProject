Global Times [edited]<http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1028636.shtml>At least 30 people have died in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais over the past week due to yellow fever, while the total number of suspected cases has risen to 110, health authorities confirmed Thursday [12 Jan 2017]. According to the state's Secretariat of Health, among the 30 dead, 10 have been proven to be caused by the disease, while all the others tested positive for yellow fever. The outbreak seemed to be getting worse as the number of cases has risen from 48 to 110 over the last week.Yellow fever is an acute viral disease which can kill a sufferer in less than a week if not treated in a timely manner. It is mainly transmitted by the bite of an infected female mosquito.Yellow fever is also commonly found in monkeys.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of suspected cases of yellow fever (YF) increased from 48 reported 2 days ago to 110 today [13 Jan 2017] and deaths from 14 to 30. The previously reported cases were all spill-over from sylvan (forest) transmission. Presumably, these new cases were also sylvan cases. However, there is the risk that one of these individuals might arrive in an urban setting while viremic, triggering an urban transmission cycle should both _Aedes aegypti_ and unvaccinated individuals be present, as occurred in Paraguay in 2008. - Mod.TYMaps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4517>.]
