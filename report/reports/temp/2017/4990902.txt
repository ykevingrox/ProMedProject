Food Safety News [edited]<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/04/outbreak-strain-found-in-several-brands-of-flour-from-ardent-mills/#.WP4NGoWcFPY>The Public Health Agency of Canada has confirmed 27 cases of _E. coli_ O121 infections across 5 Canadian provinces since November 2016 that have been linked to flour produced by Ardent Mills Canada. A 28th victim was a visitor to the country. A total of 7 of the outbreak victims were hospitalized, but are recovering. No deaths have been reported in relation to the outbreak._E. coli_ O121 is a Shiga toxin-producing strain of _E. coli_. In recent years, according to the CDC, it has been responsible for outbreaks associated with flour, frozen foods and raw clover sprouts.Provinces reporting illnesses and the number of cases in each are:British Columbia, 12;Saskatchewan 4;Alberta 5;Ontario 1; andNewfoundland and Labrador 5.The country of origin of the affected visitor was not released. The 14 male and 14 female victims range in age from 8 years to 79 years, with an average of 24 years. On [Tue 28 Mar 2017], the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), in concert with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), informed the public that ""Original Robin Hood All Purpose Flour"" was confirmed to be contaminated with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O121.Smucker Foods of Canada Corp. recalled an undisclosed amount of the Robin Hood branded flour on [Tue 28 Mar 2017]. Robin Hood has been a member of the Smucker family of brands in Canada since 2004. Consumers and others can identify the recalled 10 kg [approx. 22 lb] bags of flour by looking for the following label information: UPC number 0 59000 01652 8; and Product code containing BB/MA 2018 AL 17 and 6 291 548.Ardent Mills Canada is the manufacturer of Robin Hood Flour. In a statement released [Sun 16 Apr 2017], the company acknowledged that it was ""... aware of one illness associated with the consumption of flour,"" but emphasized that no illnesses were linked to the additional products included in subsequent recall notices.The additional recalls are a result either of the detection of _E. coli_ O121 in a sample of the production lot or a determination that the product was manufactured using the same source material as a product that tested positive for _E. coli_ O121, according to CFIA.""One specific product has been directly linked to a case of illness,"" a CFIA spokesperson told Food Safety News. ""Other products with specific production dates, while not linked to specific cases of illness, have been analyzed by our laboratory and found to contain the same type of _E. coli_ that is of concern in the outbreak.""So far, CFIA has not carried out environmental sampling in the production facility, but has focused of sampling flour products on the market. The genetic pattern of the Canadian outbreak strain is unrelated to the strain of _E. coli_ O121 that was responsible for an outbreak of more than 60 illnesses in the U.S. in 2016. That outbreak was traced to flour produced by a General Mills facility in Kansas City, MO.All of the recalled Ardent Mills products were manufactured in 1 facility, during a 3 week period from [14 Oct to 3 Nov.2016]. Some of the products were distributed to retailers, including Costco Canada, while others were supplied to hotels, restaurants, and institutional customers. Additional brand names of the recalled flour include: Arrezzio, BakerSource, Brodie, Creative Baker, GFS, Golden Temple, Great Canadian Bagel, Kitchen Essentials, Robin Hood, and Sunspun.[Byline: Phyllis Entis]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) serotype is identified as O121, one of the non-O157 EHEC serotypes. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21, and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5).References----------1.
