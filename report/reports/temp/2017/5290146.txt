Symptoms include watery eyes, discharge, discomfort, sensitively to light, subconjunctival hemorrhaging, and itchiness.Conjunctivitis is highly contagious and can be caused by bacterial or viral infections; only the bacterial version is treatable. It is typically caused by adenovirus, but other viruses have been implicated in conjunctival infection including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), picornavirus (enterovirus 70, Coxsackie A24), poxvirus (molluscum contagiosum, vaccinia), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Transmission may occur through accidental inoculation of viral particles from the patient's hands or by contact with infected upper respiratory droplets, fomites, contaminated swimming pools, or allergens in the environment. The infection usually resolves spontaneously within 2-4 weeks.[Excerpted from <http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1191370-overview>]Numerous other Latin American and Caribbean countries have also been reporting outbreaks of the disease since late 2016.See ProMED Conjunctivitis - Caribbean (05): Cuba 20170729.5214589 for further discussion on conjunctivitis. -Mod LKA Healthmap / ProMED of Nicaragua can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/23>]
