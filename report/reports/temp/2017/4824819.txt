Yahoo News, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]<https://www.yahoo.com/news/brazil-yellow-fever-outbreak-worst-record-161230752.html>So far, 65 people are confirmed to have died [of yellow fever (YF)] over the last 2 months, in Brazil's worst yellow fever outbreak on record, the government said.There have been 180 confirmed cases of the disease, which is carried by mosquitoes, since [1 Dec 2016], the health ministry said [Mon 6 Feb 2017].Most have been in the south eastern Minas Gerais state, where 56 people have died. Another 6 died in Espritu Santo and 3 in Sao Paulo, the health ministry said.A further 89 suspicious deaths and 751 possible cases of illness are being investigated, meaning the toll could rise.This has been the worst [YF] outbreak since statistics began in 1980 and far worse than the previous most serious outbreak in 2000, which saw 40 deaths and 85 confirmed cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The death toll from YF in Brazil continues to climb slowly. One hopes that the vaccination campaigns that have begun in the affected localities will end human cases, although monkeys may continue to become infected. There is still no indication if any of these fatal cases acquired their YF virus infections from urban _Aedes aegypti_. The report does not indicate if any of these cases occurred in new localities, or all are from the previously reported areas.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TY]
