Hepatitis News Today [edited]<https://hepatitisnewstoday.com/2017/05/09/newly-diagnosed-hepatitis-delta-virus-us-up/>The number of people newly diagnosed with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in the USA is increasing. Furthermore, the incidence of HDV co-infection among chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients also is rising nationwide. These alarming conclusions come from data from an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) analysis presented by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals at the 2017 Digestive Disease Week, held in Chicago, Illinois, [6-9 May 2017].""Hepatitis delta is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis, and due to the absence of an approved therapy, testing for hepatitis delta infection has been limited historically,"" Eduardo B. Martins, MD, senior vice president of liver and infectious diseases development at Eiger, said in a press release.""Results from this ICD-10 analysis indicate that only 4.7 percent of chronic HBV patients are tested for HDV co-infection, even though this represents a 30 percent increase in HDV testing in 2016 versus 2012. Our data support the need for increasing awareness and diagnosis of hepatitis delta infection."" Martins added.HDV occurs only as a co-infection in individuals infected with HBV. HDV causes more severe liver disease than HBV alone, and is linked to accelerated liver fibrosis, liver cancer, and liver failure.In the study ""Prevalence of Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) Infection in the United States: Results from an ICD-10 Review,"" published last month [April 2017] in the journal Gastroenterology, Martins and Jeffrey Glenn conducted a U.S.-specific assessment of medical claims between 2006 and 2015 for HBV/HDV co-infection, and HBV without HDV co-infection.Between 2006 and 2014, the database contained 118 867 unique individual cases of HBV mono-infection and 14 711 individual cases of HBV/HDV co-infection, a prevalence rate of 12.3 percent. Between October-December 2015, the prevalence rate was 5.6 percent (583 HBV/HDV co-infection; 10 333 HBV mono-infection). According to the results from the study, more than 11.8 percent of those infected with chronic HBV also may have HDV. Of note, researchers found that only a small percentage of those with chronic HBV (4.7 percent) are being tested for HDV co-infection.The results showed that an increase in HDV testing among people infected with HBV can significantly increase the numbers of detected HDV/HBV co-infection cases in the USA. Researchers also emphasized that clinicians should be aware of the growing footprint associated with the HDV patient population and the potential for undiagnosed HDV cases. The team concluded that the findings highlight the need for more HDV testing among patients infected with HBV. In the USA, HDV testing is available through commercial laboratories.[Byline: Daniela Semedo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It is clear that screening for the delta virus, a defective virus that can really only replicate in individuals infected with hepatitis B virus, is underdiagnosed but the extent of underdiagnosis is not clear. HDV has the smallest RNA genome of all known animal viruses. However, the RNA is comparable, although larger, to viroid RNAs, pathogenic agents of higher plants. Although serologic assays for HDV are available, many health care deliverers do not uniformly screen for HDV in HBV infected patients except in more severe cases of acute or chronic HBV infections.The following narrative is from Alves C, Branco C, and Cunha C: Hepatitis delta virus: A peculiar virus. Adv Virol 2013 http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/560105 (<https://www.hindawi.com/journals/av/2013/560105/>) related to the clinical expression of delta virus infection (the references can be found at the original URL): ""Hepatitis delta virus is usually associated with a severe form of hepatitis, but the range of clinical manifestations is very wide going from asymptomatic cases to fulminant hepatitis. Regarding HDV transmission, like its helper virus HBV, it is parenterally transmitted through exposure to infected blood or body fluids. Intrafamilial spread is naturally common in highly endemic regions.""HDV requires the presence of HBsAg to form new infectious virions and propagate HDV infection. Thus, hepatitis D only occurs in individuals infected with HBV. Consequently, there are 2 major patterns of infection: ""coinfection"" with HBV and HDV or ""superinfection"" of patients already infected with HBV. A rare 3rd pattern has been reported; it can occur after liver transplantation for an HDV-infected individual and is designated as ""helper-independent latent infection"" [18]. In this scenario, an initial HDV infection of the new liver occurs without any apparent help from HBV. Such an infection remains asymptomatic unless reactivated by HBV appearance [18].""For an HBV and HDV acute coinfection, the most common outcome (95 percent) is viral clearance [14]. However, it can be more severe than an acute HBV monoinfection, resulting in some cases in acute liver failure [19]. Acute hepatitis strikes after an incubation period of 3-7 weeks, beginning with a period of nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, or nausea [20].""HDV superinfection of chronic HBV patients also causes severe acute hepatitis, but in this case, for up to 80 percent of patients, it progresses to chronicity [21]. The processes, which determine whether a patient clears HDV spontaneously or becomes chronically infected, remain unclear. When chronic HDV infection is established, the preexisting liver disease caused by HBV is usually aggravated [22]. It has been claimed that, during the acute phase of HDV infection, HBV replication is suppressed to very low levels and that this suppression can persist once a chronic HDV infection is established [23]. Patients with HDV superinfection suffer a more rapid progression to cirrhosis [24, 25], increased liver decompensation, and eventually death [26], when compared with patients with HBV monoinfection. Despite the higher rates of progression to cirrhosis, not all published studies refer to an increased rate of hepatocellular carcinoma [27]. One explanation of this may be the abovementioned suppression of HBV replication by HDV, since other studies assert that higher HBV DNA serum levels correlate with a greater risk of carcinoma [28].""- Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
