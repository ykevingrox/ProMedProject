Then those people have gone on to spread it to others.""Dr Sheppeard said measles is the most contagious infection out there. ""It can spread without even coming into direct contact with the person,"" she said.""So it is likely they were in the same shopping center or pharmacy or medical center, not even exactly at the same time as the person who is sick.""The latest cases visited the following known locations while infectious: see URL aboveDr Sheppeard said people with 2 doses of measles vaccinations are 99 percent protected against infection.

Since the beginning of the year [2017] there have been 3468 confirmed cases and 14 deaths due to measles in Guinea. Conakry and NzÌ©rÌ©korÌ© are the most affected districts.Routine vaccination in Guinea was drastically reduced during the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic, both because most resources and attention were geared towards the management of Ebola and, mainly, due to fear. People stayed away from health facilities and vaccination activities were suspended because of infection risks, and this left thousands of young children unprotected against easily preventable diseases. A nation-wide vaccination campaign was organized by authorities one year ago to vaccinate the children who had not received their shots (MSF did not participate to this campaign). Despite this catch up effort, a measles epidemic was declared on [Wed 8 Feb 2017].""The fact that a new epidemic occurs barely a year after a massive vaccination campaign is a worrying sign of the weakness of health care in Guinea"", says Ibrahim Diallo, MSF's representative in Guinea. ""Major problems remain in the health system, undermining its capacity to prevent and respond to outbreaks effectively and in a timely manner.""After the devastating Ebola epidemic that killed over 11 000 people and severely affected the health systems of the 3 most affected countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia), the WHO and leading public health experts insisted on the importance of rebuilding responsive health systems in the 3 countries, equipping and supporting them to better manage similar or new health crises.According to the UN body in charge of Ebola response, only 18 percent of the funds disbursed to support countries during Ebola were meant for recovery. International donor commitments to health systems strengthening have focused on improving disease surveillance to ensure early detection and response to outbreaks, such as Ebola. However, in the face of a large outbreak of measles, MSF (in Conakry) and Alima (in NzÌ©rokorÌ© district) are currently the only NGOs providing support to the Ministry of Health for the vaccination campaign in the worst affected districts. WHO and UNICEF have pledged support to other affected districts across the country, which is still under discussion.""If Ebola was a wakeup call, since then the world seems to have fallen back asleep. As shown by this measles outbreak, the concrete impact of the promises of funding, support and training made during and after the Ebola crisis still remains to be felt by ordinary Guineans"", says Dr Mit Philips, MSF's Health Policy Analyst. ""Access to good healthcare was clearly lacking before Ebola struck, and the country is still facing today the same problems that it was facing then, largely alone, in spite of the international public commitments to build better and more responsive health systems"".To contain the measles epidemic, MSF, with the Ministry of Health in Conakry, is mobilizing 126 teams of 13 people, spread out across 164 vaccination sites in a city of 3 million people. All children from 6 months up to 10 years old will be vaccinated. MSF also supports 30 health centers in Conakry to care for children suffering from mild cases of measles, as well as the referral center where severe cases are hospitalized.Notes to editorsMSF and Ebola response: From the very beginning of the recent Ebola epidemic, MSF responded in the worst affected countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - by setting up Ebola treatment centers and providing services such as treatment and care, psychological support, health promotion, surveillance and contact tracing. At its peak, MSF employed nearly 4000 national staff and over 325 international staff to combat the epidemic across the 3 countries. MSF admitted a total of 10 376 patients to its Ebola management centers, of which 5226 were confirmed Ebola cases.MSF in Guinea: MSF has been working in Guinea since 1984 and has previously assisted in outbreaks concerning cholera and measles. It is currently providing HIV and TB services in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, supporting treatment to around 9000 HIV patients. The organization closed its Ebola-related activities supporting survivors last September [2016] in Guinea.On measles: Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases today, where one infected person can contaminate up to 18 non - immunized people. Worldwide an estimated 367 people, mostly children, die of measles every day, half of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Measles vaccination coverage of 95 percent of a population prevents the occurrence of outbreaks and epidemics within this population.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[With the end of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, attention needs to focus on rebuilding the health infrastructure so other public health problems such as TB, HIV, malaria, and vaccine-preventable diseases can be addressed.

It is normal for Portugal to have isolated cases, ""emphasizes GraÌ¤a Freitas.The vaccination coverage rate in Portugal is high, ranging from 95 to 97 percent.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap showing the location of Portugal in Europe can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42> - Mod.LK]******[7] USA (California, Orange County)Date: Fri 07 Apr 2017 10:52 a.m.Source: Orange County Register [edited]<http://www.ocregister.com/articles/story-748719-measles-.html>An unvaccinated Laguna Beach High School student has been quarantined by county health officials after contracting measles.Jessica Good, spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency, said [Thu 6 Apr 2017], that the teen may have exposed other students to the highly contagious virus.Infectious disease specialists did an assessment at the high school and identified 6 other unvaccinated students who may have been exposed to the virus when the infected student was on campus [Wed 29 Mar 2017]. All of them have been barred from attending school and will have to stay home until [Tue 18 Apr 2017], the end of the incubation period, Good said.The case is the 2nd in the county in 2017. The 1st case was reported to the Health Care Agency earlier this year [January 2017]. The adult, who was vaccinated, was exposed on an international flight. Because the person chose to self-quarantine and there was no risk of exposure, the county agency is not required to disclose the person's identity or location, Good said.In 2016, there were 35 reported cases in the county.On [Wed 5 Apr 2017], the Laguna Beach Unified School District sent notices to all parents of students in its 4 schools. The notification included symptoms associated with the infectious disease, including fever; rash; cough; and red, watery eyes. Measles spreads easily by air and by direct contact with an infected person. It is contagious even before a rash appears.The district advised parents who notice any of these symptoms to notify the Health Care Agency immediately.Children must be immunized against the following 9 diseases: diphtheria, hepatitis B., measles, mumps, whooping cough, polio, rubella, tetanus and chicken pox.A state law, Senate Bill 277, that went into effect in 2016, says parents of children who attend public or private schools can no longer refuse to vaccinate their children based on personal belief. They can still receive medical exemptions. If parents submitted personal-belief exemptions prior to 1 January 2016, the exemptions will remain in place until the student is in 7th grade.[Byline: Erika I.
