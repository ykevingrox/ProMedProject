HPS is a serious disease and can develop quickly, with a case fatality rate of around 30 percent.This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infection nor specify the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41718>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Chile (Los Lagos region)Date: Wed 12 Jul 2017Source: ADN Radio [in Spanish, trans.

It could have been in his home, where there was an indication of the presence of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) in storage areas. As an agricultural worker, he no doubt came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus during his work. The numbers of cases of hantavirus infections in the Los Lagos region continues to increase this year [2017] and reported cases that ProMED-mail has posted now total 14. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/30531>. - Mod.TY]
