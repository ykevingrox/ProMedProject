I Tech Post [edited]<http://www.itechpost.com/articles/75118/20170117/yellow-fever-outbreak-brazil-kills-30-officials-fear-epidemic.htm>Brazil public health officials are concerned that a small yellow fever outbreak in Minas Gerais State in south eastern Brazil might cause a larger epidemic. The outbreak has already infected about 110 people and caused 30 deaths as of Friday [13 Jan 2017]. Minas Gerais is an area with low vaccination rates for yellow fever. It is also adjacent to the populous state of Sau Paulo.Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease with symptoms including fever, nausea, chills, muscle pain, loss of appetite and headaches. It further leads to bleeding, kidney problems and liver damage causing yellow skin. Yellow fever is spread by the same mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_) that carries dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses.A 180-day state of emergency has already been declared in Minas Gerais. The cases were considered sylvatic (passed by mosquitoes in the wild from rural areas). It is expected to stop immediately with the cold weather. However, officials fear that if the virus reaches a city with more _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, it may result in fast yellow fever virus outbreaks and might get out of hand.The government has already deployed more health workers to control the situation. ""We are taking all the preventive measures, especially in affected areas in the rural zone,"" governor Fernando Pimentel said, according to the New York Times. ""Everything that is necessary is being done, and with the help of everyone and the awareness of the population, we will overcome this moment.""There is no cure yet for the disease, and the only recommended treatment is complete rest and use of pain relievers, fever reducers, and drinking plenty of water, according to the Huffington Post. Yellow fever has a mortality rate of 20-50 per cent. It causes up to 200 000 infections and 30 000 deaths every year, about 90 per cent of which occur in Africa. One of the most recent endemic yellow fever outbreaks occurred in Angola, with 345 deaths and 3317 suspected cases.[byline: Anne Dominguez]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the 13 Jan 2017 report, the state authorities said they were investigating 133 suspected cases of yellow fever, of which 20 were considered probable, pending further testing. They said they were also looking into reports of 38 deaths, 10 of them suspected of being caused by yellow fever, according to the State Health Secretariat's website (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20170114.4766222). The above report indicates that there are 110 cases with 30 deaths but does not state whether they are laboratory confirmed or just suspected. Both reports indicate that these are sylvan (forest) transmission cases, not urban transmission involving _Aedes aegypti_.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4517>. - Mod.TY]******[2] CommentDate: Tue 17 Jan 2017From: F Murilo Zerbini <zerbini@ufv.br> [edited]One very important piece of information that I haven't yet seen in any report of this outbreak is that yellow fever is part of the immunization calendar of every child in Minas Gerais state (as a resident of the state and father of 3 children ages 8, 7, and 2, I know). My kids got their shots for free at a city-maintained clinic (""Posto de Saude"").I don't know for how long YF has been included in the calendar. If it's recent, then it's perfectly possible that older people never got vaccinated.It would be interesting to know whether children are being affected in this outbreak, or whether it is mostly older people.--Prof F Murilo ZerbiniUniversidade Federal de ViÌ¤osaViÌ¤osa, MGBrasil<zerbini@ufv.br>[ProMED-mail thanks Prof Zerbini for his comments.It is curious that the I Tech Post report above indicates that Minas Gerais is a state with a low yellow vaccination rate, and yet Prof Zerbini's comment would indicate that YF vaccination is a part of the childhood immunization schedule. Perhaps his suggestion is correct that older individuals may not have been vaccinated as children or later in life. Previous reports about the cases in Mato Grosso indicated that affected individuals had not been vaccinated, and a campaign to expand coverage would be initiated soon. One hopes that the campaign will be successful and prevent spill-over into the urban _Aedes aegypti_ cycle of transmission. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
