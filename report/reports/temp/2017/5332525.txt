MMWR 2017;66: 1001-1002 [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6637a8.htm?s_cid=mm6637a8_w>Notes from the Field: Travel-Associated Melioidosis and Resulting Laboratory Exposures -- USA, 2016-----------------------------------In mid-July 2016, a Pennsylvania resident aged 15 years who had recently returned from Thailand was treated by a pediatrician for sore throat, fever, and bilateral thigh abscesses at the sites of mosquito bites (Figure - for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL). She had traveled to northeast Thailand with 9 other teens as part of an 18-day service-oriented trip run by an Ohio-based youth tour company that arranges travel to Thailand for approximately 500 persons annually. This trip included construction and agricultural activities and recreational mud exposures. The patient subsequently developed right inguinal lymphadenopathy and worsening abscesses, which prompted specimen collection for culture on 25 Aug 2017. This specimen was sent to a commercial laboratory in New Jersey, which identified _ Burkholderia pseudomallei_, the causative organism of melioidosis, on 30 Aug 2017. The patient did not experience pneumonia or bacteremia, and recovered fully after 2 weeks of intensive therapy with parenteral ceftazidime and a 6-month outpatient course of eradication therapy with doxycycline.Melioidosis has variable, nonspecific presentation, which can include cutaneous infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, septicemia, and other manifestations, after an incubation period of 1-21 days, although longer incubations of months or years have been reported (1,2). It is typically acquired from direct contact with soil or water contaminated with _B. pseudomallei_, which is highly endemic in northeast Thailand (2). Interviews with a tour company official revealed communication gaps regarding destination-specific health risks. With input from the Ohio and Pennsylvania Departments of Health, the tour company distributed a letter to participants and staff members who were on the patient's trip, alerting them to melioidosis symptoms and exposure possibilities. No other trip participants responded to the letter to report symptoms. The tour company was advised to include CDC Yellow Book (3) resources in its pre-departure materials for clients._B. pseudomallei_ is not reportable in Pennsylvania, but is listed as a Tier 1 select agent, indicating its potential to pose a serious health threat (4). Although rare, laboratory acquisition of melioidosis through unknowing exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ has been documented (4,5). Exposures for employees of the New Jersey commercial laboratory were categorized and managed according to published guidelines (4). Among 41 laboratory technologists assessed, serologic testing and symptom self-monitoring was recommended for 2 technologists who were exposed to aerosols while manipulating the culture outside of a biologic safety cabinet, and 2 who had predisposing medical conditions (diabetes [1] and long-term steroid use [1]) and were present in the laboratory during the aerosol-generating procedures. The 2 technologists handling the culture were also prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for antimicrobial prophylaxis. One technologist developed fever, cough, and rash and was temporarily excluded from work. This was diagnosed as an adverse reaction to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and resolved after switching to doxycycline. No melioidosis cases were identified among exposed laboratory technologists.Because only 0 to 5 cases of melioidosis are identified annually in the USA and the disease has nonspecific and possibly delayed symptoms, it might not initially be suspected as a diagnosis (1,4,6). When patient travel history is compatible with _B. pseudomallei_ exposure, clinicians should have a higher index of suspicion and share this suspicion with laboratory personnel to reduce exposure risk. Persons on service-oriented trips might be at higher risk for acquiring melioidosis than a typical traveler because of the potential for quasi-occupational exposures such as construction and farm work. Travelers should be advised to seek information about the particular health risks associated with their destinations and planned activities, and should share this information with health care providers if symptoms develop. Travel organizers should also be informed of the health risks related to the destinations they serve and types of trips they offer.References--------Wiersinga WJ, Currie BJ, Peacock SJ. Melioidosis.

These categories are category A, category B, and category C.To further divide select agents, in accordance with Executive Order 13546, Optimizing the Security of Biological Select Agents and Toxins in the United States, HHS and CDC have designated specific select agents and toxins that present the greatest risk of intentional misuse with the most significant potential for mass causalities or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence as ""Tier 1"" agents [14]. Tier 1 select agents possess the greatest risk to human health and safety [14]. They are the most important for healthcare 1st responders to understand [14]._Bacillus anthracis_: Anthrax is caused by a gram-positive, rod shaped bacterium, known as _Bacillus anthracis_, and can result in a serious infectious disease [15]. Depending upon the portal of entry, anthrax can cause cutaneous anthrax (presented by small blisters with a black center), inhalation anthrax (presented by shortness of breath, nausea, body aches), and gastrointestinal anthrax (presented by swelling of neck glands, swelling of abdomen, bloody diarrhea; [16]). Because it can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects wild and domestic animals, people can contract the disease if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products ([15]). Anthrax can be treated with antibiotics, including penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin [15]._Francisella tularensis_: Tularemia is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ found in animals and is a potentially serious illness [17]. Patients present with symptoms of progressive weakness and joint pain and sometimes ulcers on the skin or mouth. If exposed by inhalation, then symptoms would include severe respiratory illness, including life-threatening pneumonia and systemic infection [17]. Treatment of tularemia is administering antibiotics, including the tetracycline class (i.e., doxycycline) or fluoroquinolone class (i.e., ciprofloxacin; [17])._Yersinia pestis_: Plague is caused by the bacterium _ Yersinia pestis_ found in rodents and their fleas [18]. In an aerosol attack using _Yersinia pestis_, patients will present the pneumonic form of plague. Treatment of plague includes administering antimicrobials, such as the tetracycline class (i.e., doxycycline) or fluoroquinolone class (i.e., ciprofloxacin; [18])._Brucella_ species: Brucellosis is caused by bacteria and is a serious infectious disease [19]. Individuals can get the disease through contact with an infected animal or contaminated animal product [19]. Characteristic symptoms of brucellosis include anorexia, swelling of the liver and/or spleen, and arthritis. Treatment entails administering a cocktail of antibiotics, including tetracyclines, rifampicin, and the aminoglycoside streptomycin [19]._Burkholderia mallei_: Glanders is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ and results in an infectious disease [20]). Characteristic symptoms of glanders include light sensitivity, ulceration if through localized infection, pneumonia through pulmonary infection, and potential multiple abscesses within the muscles and skin of limbs if chronic [20]). Humans can contract the disease by contact with infected animals or through inhalation of infected aerosols. Glanders can be treated with antibiotics, including tetracyclines, gentamicin, and others [20])._Burkholderia pseudomallei_ : Melioidosis, an infectious disease, is caused by the bacterium _ Burkholderia pseudomallei_ found in contaminated water and soil [21]. Humans can become infected through contact with the contaminated source. Characteristic symptoms of melioidosis include ulceration and abscess; however, pulmonary, bloodstream, and disseminated infections of the disease may present different clinical manifestations. Treatment of melioidosis includes antimicrobial agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ceftazidime [21].Variola virus: Smallpox is caused the variola virus and results in a serious infectious disease [22]. A characteristic symptom of the disease is pustules that begin to crust and then scab. There is no treatment for smallpox [22]._Clostridium botulinum_ : Botulism is caused by the toxin made by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ [23]. It is a muscle-paralyzing disease and can be foodborne (ingesting toxin) or cause wound botulism (wounds infected with _C. botulinum_). The treatment includes taking the antitoxin [23].A commonality seen in these agents is that they occur naturally in nature and could be isolated and grown in a rogue laboratory [24]. The most devastating scenario using these pathogens would be airborne dispersal over a concentrated population along with food and water contamination [25]. Characteristics that make a pathogen especially high-risk for bioterrorism include highly contagious, low infective dose, survival in a variety of environmental conditions, and ability to be aerosolized. Almost all the Tier 1 agents mentioned above possess nearly all of these characteristics [25]. - Mod.LLProMED HealthMaps:Pennsylvania, United States: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/240>Thailand: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151>]
