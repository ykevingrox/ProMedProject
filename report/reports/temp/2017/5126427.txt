The Observer [edited]<http://www.lagrandeobserver.com/news/local/5373430-151/mumps-outbreak-hits-county>The [Oregon] Center for Human Development [CHD] announced [Mon 12 Jun 2017] there are 4 confirmed cases of mumps in Union County and 5 presumptive cases. The presumptive cases involve people who are displaying mumps symptoms but have not yet been confirmed by lab tests, according to Andi Walsh, community relations and emergency preparedness coordinator for the CHD.People of all ages are contracting the disease. ""It is not just a children's disease. It is affecting the entire community,"" Walsh said.The CHD is encouraging people to get vaccinated. ""We're asking all residents to get a mumps vaccine unless they have already received 2 doses of the vaccine,"" Connie Carter, public health communicable disease nurse at CHD, said.Most individuals who contract mumps will have a mild illness that lasts a week or so, but some people may have more serious outcomes. ""Those outcomes include testicular swelling, hearing loss, swelling around the brain and spinal cord or brain damage,"" Carter said.Though officials are urging county residents to get vaccinated against the virus, the vaccine might not work as well for some people, so having as many qualified individuals who are healthy enough to receive the vaccination is important.""Having high vaccine rates in the community also protects those who can't be vaccinated because they are too young or have a health condition that prevents it,"" Carter said.Meanwhile, officials are working on pinpointing where the disease in Union County originated, but according to Carrie Brogoitti, public health administrator with CHD, the extensive investigation will take time.While it may never be known how mumps came to the county, public health workers want residents to know what the symptoms are and how the disease is contracted so they can protect themselves and their families.Symptoms of mumps include puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Other indicators of the virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, according to the news release. The 1st symptoms typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection and up to 25 days after initial contact.""Some people may not have signs of illness. If you think that you have the mumps, stay away from others,"" Carter said. ""Do not show up at the emergency room or your health care provider's office. Instead, call your provider and ask what you should do next.""The communicable disease is spread easily through fluids from the mouth, nose, or throat. It can spread two days before signs of the illness appear, and up to 5 days after the swelling begins.An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, or sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others, according to the release.Health officials are warning that if someone thinks they might have contracted the mumps, then they should stay away from others.Health officials are also encouraging anyone who thinks they might be infected to not show up at an emergency room or a health care provider's office. Health officials are urging anyone who believes they may have mumps to call their primary provider and ask for instructions, according to the release.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Oregon (Jackson County)Date: Fri 16 Jun 2017Source: KTVL [edited]<http://ktvl.com/news/local/public-health-officials-seeing-mumps-outbreak-across-oregon>Jackson County [Oregon] Public Health officials say they're noticing a spike of mumps cases across the state.Locally, Jackson County has only had 1 confirmed case this year [2017].Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease, usually given to children at a year and then between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Symptoms include fever, headache, and most notably swollen salivary glands. Public health officials said all diagnosed cases are reported to the county, so they prevent the illness from spreading.""Anytime we see something greater than the expected it keeps everybody busy. You're doing a lot of investigating trying to figure out why you are seeing an increase in whatever disease or virus it could be,"" said Tanya Phillips with Jackson County Public Health.If there are complications from mumps it can lead to inflammation around the brain or deafness.[Byline: Megan Allison]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Oregon can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/239>.

None of the cases required hospitalization and all 3 are recovering. An additional 5 cases were confirmed today [17 Jun 2017], involving 1 adult and 4 children, none of whom required hospitalization.DOH expects the current mumps outbreak to continue and the investigation of new cases is ongoing.The MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine provides the best protection against the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent effective at protecting against mumps and 1 dose is 78 percent effective. Being fully vaccinated can help protect loved ones, family members, friends, classmates, and coworkers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Hawaii can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4520>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[4] California (Los Angeles County)Date: Tue 20 Jun 2017 00:16 PDTSource: Norcal News [edited]<http://norcal.news/news/23802-mumps-outbreak-la-county-infects-42-people>A sudden mumps outbreak in Los Angeles County [California] has now infected 42 people, and many of those are living on the Westside.Nationally, mumps has been a major problem in recent years. There were 5833 cases nationwide last year [2016], and that number seems to be rising this year. As of May [2017], there have been 3176 nationwide cases this year, on pace to exceed last year's comfortably.Some vaccinated individuals have been affected, with the majority of cases being found in places where people are kept in closed quarters, such as college campuses. The MMR vaccine, designed to protect against mumps among other diseases, does not seem to be covering it.The vaccine's effectiveness is not really in question, but there are thoughts of adding additional doses. Now, doses are given when children are about 1 year of age and then again before school age. The vaccine may wane before adulthood is reached. Some, like military members, are given additional doses of the vaccine in basic training, but the general population does not receive a booster.Research has shone that it may be just a blip though. Most of those infected intermingle. Most of the cases have been seen on campuses, in bars, nightclubs, or other similar places. People infected tend to have the same social networks.It is recommended that you limit contact with affected individuals. Do not share drinks. Avoid shaking hands. Make sure to wash your hands often. If you are infected, you should limit your contact with other people until you're better and should see a doctor immediately to start your treatment. Please be courteous to others and try not to spread the virus around.Regardless of this blip, the national incidence of mumps is down more than 99 percent since before the introduction of the MMR vaccine, so these numbers are nothing too much to worry about. It's just important that everyone take the proper precautions to avoid getting infected, especially if you live in an outbreak area.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4259>.

Public Health England (PHE), alongside the NHS, are investigating after nearly 450 cases were reported between [1 Jan-30 May 2017]. This is an increase of 150 cases compared to the same 5-month period in 2016. The City of Westminster had the lowest infection rate with only 8 cases, with 15 reported in Kensington and Chelsea.This news comes in tandem with data that show that cases of measles have also sky-rocketed in London and the South East last year [2017], reaching the highest number since the last outbreak in 2012 (which saw 3873 cases across England and Wales). There were a total of 60 cases recorded in 2016 (there were 382 in 2012), compared to just 4 in 2015. London and the South West were the only 2 regions to record more cases of the viral infection last year [2016].The upturn in both mumps and measles can be traced to the falling numbers of children undergoing the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation has set a target of 95 percent, but vaccination rates have fallen to 91.9 percent. This recent fall has followed years of broadly rising coverage since the MMR controversy, when the vaccine was linked to autism in a now-discredited paper in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of the United Kingdom can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/283>The mumps virus is an RNA virus belonging to the genus _Rubulavirus_ in the family Paramyxovirus. According to the CDC, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. However, this past year has seen a upswing in the number of mumps cases.MMR (Measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. 2 doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66 to 95 percent) effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49 percent to 92 percent) effective. It is important that children get vaccinated since the disease can be more severe in adults. While some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease, and most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks, symptoms can be serious. Complications may include infections of the coverings of the brain (15 percent), pancreatitis (4 percent), permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility. - Mod.LK]
