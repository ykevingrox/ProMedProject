EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The 1/3rd of the HAV cohort who report themselves as being MSM may be an underestimate, (i.e. some of the cohort may not be openly MSM)..The rest of the cases have a mix of possible exposures:- About 8 of the cases (15%) are secondary cases (they resided in the same household as a confirmed case and had onset one incubation period later).- 2 cases traveled internationally during their exposure period, so were likely exposed in a different country.- 2 cases attend the same gym.- 1 case is homeless and spent time in southern California before being diagnosed in Colorado.- There was a cluster of 5-7 cases that might be due to IVDU or possibly a restaurant.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[The above report is in response to Hepatitis A - USA (14): (CO) RFI Archive Number: 20170725.5201341. ProMED acknowledges the continued efforts of the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project members in reporting important information regarding outbreaks. From this response, the increase in numbers in Colorado is likely multifactorial. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209>.]
