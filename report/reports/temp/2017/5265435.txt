The reported numbers affirm a total of 1997 deaths starting from the end of April 2017. As of Saturday evening [19 Aug 2017], the number of cholera cases stands at 527 000.The WHO report also noted that Yemen's Sanaa and Al Hudaydah governorate, located in the west of the country, have the highest rates of cholera spread compared with other governorates. The combined number of infected individuals in the two areas stands at 62 000. The Hajjah governorate has maintained the highest number of cholera related deaths reported at 381.Meanwhile, the United Nations has raised the Humanitarian Response Plan budget to address the Yemeni crisis. The new budget is placed at USD 370 million. Despite the critical situation in Yemen and the spread of cholera, the international organization said that only 33 per cent of the required funds have been provided by donors, most notably Saudi Arabia.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although a number of sources had reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the new numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period.The statistics related to this record-breaking epidemic of _V. cholerae_ in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 182825 Jul / 402 484 / 188026 Jul / 408 583 / 188529 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196619 Aug / 527 000 / 1997In the last complete year of data (2015; <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>), WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries.
