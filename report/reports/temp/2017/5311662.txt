Gazette Live [edited]<http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/dish-caused-food-poisoning-outbreak-13586856>The source of the foodborne illness outbreak at a boutique hotel and restaurant has been identified. Public Health England (PHE) has revealed that chicken liver parfait [pate passed through a sieve - Mod.JH] was the cause of illness at Brockley Hall Hotel in Saltburn. However ""no obvious defect was noted in the production of this food item"", therefore meaning it cannot be concluded with certainty why it caused illness.A total of 8 cases were reported to PHE Northeast, 6 of which were laboratory confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis. The 2 remaining cases were ""probable"". Most of those who fell ill had been attending a 40th birthday celebration on [7 Jul 2017] with 3 of them being hospitalized included the birthday girl herself, who ended up in hospital on an intravenous drip.A spokeswoman for PHE said their investigation is now complete, and that a copy of the outbreak report has been sent to Redcar and Cleveland Council. The decision on what further action, if any, to take, rests with the local authority.She added: ""The premises (Brockley Hall) co-operated fully with the investigation and necessary control measures were implemented in the management of this outbreak. On follow up visits and reassessment, Environmental Health Officers were satisfied that there was no ongoing risk to public health and the premises could continue to serve food to the public. The outbreak was investigated as early as possible by the partners involved and effective control measures were put into place.""[Byline: Laura Love]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although ""no obvious defect was noted in the production of this food item"", there is no doubt that cross-contamination of the liver pate after cooking or, more probably, undercooking of the chicken livers was the underlying cause of the cluster of cases The first multistate outbreak of this association in the USA was reported by the CDC in 2013:CDC: Multistate outbreak of _Campylobacter jejuni_ infections associated with undercooked chicken livers--northeastern United States, 2012. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2013;62: 874-6. Available at:<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6244a2.htm>.""Abstract--------In October 2012 the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) identified 3 cases of laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection in Vermont residents; the isolates had indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. A query of PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, led to the identification of one additional case each from New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont that had been reported in the preceding 6 months. An investigation led by VDH found that all 6 patients had been exposed to raw or lightly cooked chicken livers that had been produced at the same Vermont poultry establishment (establishment A). Livers collected from this establishment yielded the outbreak strain of _C. jejuni_. In response, establishment A voluntarily ceased the sale of chicken livers on [9 Nov 2012]. A food safety assessment conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) found no major violations at the establishment. This is the 1st reported multistate outbreak of campylobacteriosis associated with chicken liver in the United States. Public health professionals, members of the food industry, and consumers should be aware that chicken livers often are contaminated with _Campylobacter_ and that fully cooking products made with chicken liver is the only way to prepare them so they are safe to eat."" Interestingly, a UK report in the CDC Emerging Infectious Diseases journal in 2016 reported that many professional cooks prefer to prepare their chicken livers somewhat undercooked which increased the risk of campylobacteriosis:Jones AK, Rigby D, Burton M, et al: Restaurant cooking trends and increased risk for Campylobacter infection. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016;22: 1208-15. Available at:<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918174/>.""Abstract--------In the UK, outbreaks of _Campylobacter_ infection are increasingly attributed to undercooked chicken livers, yet many recipes, including those of top chefs, advocate short cooking times and serving livers pink. During 2015, we studied preferences of chefs and the public in the UK and investigated the link between liver rareness and survival of _Campylobacter_. We used photographs to assess chefs' ability to identify chicken livers meeting safe cooking guidelines. To investigate the microbiological safety of livers chefs preferred to serve, we modeled _Campylobacter_ survival in infected chicken livers cooked to various temperatures. Most chefs correctly identified safely cooked livers but overestimated the public's preference for rareness and thus preferred to serve them more rare. We estimated that 19-52 percent of livers served commercially in the United Kingdom fail to reach 70 C [approx160 F] and that predicted _Campylobacter_ survival rates are 48-98 percent. These findings indicate that cooking trends are linked to increasing _Campylobacter_ infections.""Perhaps alternative ways of cooking the chicken livers using a Bain Marie technique as reported here would be a better procedure:Hutchison M, Harrison D, Richardson I and Tchorzewska M: A method for the preparation of chicken liver pate that reliably destroys Campylobacters. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2015;12: 4652-69. Available at:<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454932/>.""Abstract--------This study devised a protocol for the manufacture of commercial quantities of chicken liver pate that reliably destroyed campylobacters. A literature search identified 40 pate manufacture recipes. Recipes stages with a potential to be antimicrobial were assembled to form a new protocol that included washing with organic acid, freeze-thaw and flambe in alcohol. Naturally-contaminated, high-risk livers were obtained from clearance flocks at slaughter and the effect of each stage of the protocol on _Campylobacter_ populations was determined. Organic acid washing changed the color of the liver surfaces. However, there were no significant differences between liver surface color changes when a range of concentrations of lactic acid and ethanoic acid washes were compared by reflective spectrophotometry. A 5 percent (w/v) acid wash reduced numbers of indigenous campylobacters by around 1.5 log 10 CFU/g for both acids. The use of a Bain Marie was found to more reproducibly apply heat compared with pan-frying. Antimicrobial recipe stages reduced the numbers of campylobacters, but not significantly if thermal processing was ineffective. Cooking to 63 C [approx. 145 F] was confirmed to be a critical control point for campylobacters cooked in a Bain Marie. Organoleptic and sensory assessment of pate determined an overall preference for pate made from frozen livers.""For those who are ""muggles"" of the food world, a Bain Marie (pronounced ""bahn ma ree"") is, in cooking, a receptacle containing warm water at a controlled temperature into which other containers are placed to warm or cook the food in them. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/279>.]
