According to available OIE data (figures available for the years 2011 and 2013), about 200 fatal human cases are reported annually. The number of outbreaks in animals, predominantly dogs, is counted in several hundreds per year. The disease is widely spread throughout the Republic's multiple islands.Rabies vaccination of all kept dogs and control/management of the stray dog population are essential. The number of dogs which were reportedly vaccinated against rabies in 2014 (last available data), was 482 057. - Mod.AS]
