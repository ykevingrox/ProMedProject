The Philippine Star [edited]<http://www.philstar.com/nation/2017/09/09/1737351/6-cases-deadly-japanese-encephalitis-emerge-cordillera>At least 6 cases of Japanese encephalitis have been recorded in the highland region since January [2017], the health department reported.From January to August [2017], the Department of Health-Cordillera epidemiologist Ursula Segundo said that Baguio City and Benguet province each had 2 cases. One case was reported in Abra and another in Mountain Province. There were no reported cases of Japanese encephalitis in Apayao, Ifugao and Kalinga.According to the health department, a 37-year-old teacher from Mountain Province suffered memory loss caused by Japanese encephalitis.The 6 recorded patients are undergoing supportive treatment with a team of doctors managing the disease according to symptoms.The DOH said Japanese encephalitis is endemic in several areas, including the highland region. In 2015, 13 cases were reported in the Cordillera Autonomous Region.Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease spread by blood-sucking insects, particularly mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species. _Culex_ mosquitoes are common in rural areas with rice paddies, piggeries, irrigation ditches, ground pools, among others.Symptoms of Japanese encephalitis include flu-like illnesses, headache, chills and muscle pain. In severe cases, it may progress to inflammation of the brain and seizures, paralysis and even comatose which may lead to death.Segundo advised that suspected patients of Japanese encephalitis must be brought to the hospital for laboratory tests.Aside from the 6 cases recorded in the region, 7 patients are reported to have acquired Japanese encephalitis outside the Cordillera region, the DOH-CAR added.[Byline: Artemio Dumlao]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Philippines islands are within the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus endemic zone and cases occur there sporadically each year. On Luzon Island this year (2017), as of [Fri 18 Aug 2017] the Department of Health (DOH) has recorded a total of 149 cases of JE with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga, the highest in the Central Luzon region (see Japanese encephalitis - Philippines: (PM) 20170818.5257940).A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that JE is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems.JE virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature.The Cordillera Administrative Region is comprised of 6 provinces: Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain.
