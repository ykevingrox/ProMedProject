WSAW [edited]<http://www.wsaw.com/content/news/Vilas-Oneida-Co-release-newest-whooping-cough-numbers-408830535.html>In northern Wisconsin 2 counties have released new figures regarding the number of whooping cough cases.The Oneida County and Vilas County health department reports collectively there are 39 confirmed cases, 29 probable, and 98 suspected cases of whooping cough.The number of cases prompted the Rhinelander School District to extended its Christmas break by 3 days.According to a news release, Oneida County health officials reported a decrease in new identified cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There are pertussis (whooping cough) outbreaks occurring worldwide, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in infants, variously attributed to increased virulence of outbreak strains, a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the current circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, a waning immune or ineffective immune response after vaccination with the current DTaP and Tdap [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] vaccines, as well as decreased levels of vaccine utilization in some areas. A discussion of these issues can be found in prior ProMED-mail posts (such as, Pertussis - USA (14) 20151110.3781837 and Pertussis - USA (02) 20130905.1923593).Data from the Wisconsin DOH indicate that 2012 was an epidemic year, but subsequent years had much lower activity, including 2016 (<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/pert-report.pdf>).The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/250>. A county map can be seen at <http://geology.com/county-map/wisconsin-county-map.gif>. Oneida County, with a population of almost 36 000 residents, and Vilas County, with a population of 21 430 residents, are located in the north-central region of the state (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_County,_Wisconsin> and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilas_County,_Wisconsin>). - Mod.ML]
