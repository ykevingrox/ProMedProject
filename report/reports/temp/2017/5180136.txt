At that time, Mod.AS wrote the following moderator comments, which apparently also apply today:""Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, a strictly intracellular bacterium that is a potential bioweapon. In Israel, the disease was first described during the 4th decade of the previous century and has been notifiable in humans and animals for more than 50 years. Cases in humans and in farm animals (cattle, sheep and goats) are recorded every year; in the latter, the infection is manifested by abortions, causing considerable economic losses.Though the world literature incriminates mainly farm animals as the source of human infection, this is not always supported by evidence in Israel; while in some human cases a link to farm animals or their fomites/products could be demonstrated, in the majority of cases, no such association is apparent. Other sources/animals should be considered as well. The current observation may indicate the need for more attention to the potential role of pets, particularly cats; the stray cat population in Israel is estimated to exceed 6-figure numbers, with high densities observed in urban areas. Epidemiological investigation regarding their infection rate with _Coxiella burnetii_ might be justifiable.Further reading:1. Yarrow A, Slater PE, Costin C. Q fever in Israel.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.Q fever spreads in air currents for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2>). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis) (Maurin M, Raoult D. Q fever. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999; 12(4): 518-53; available at <http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short>.) Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178>).Diagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (<https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp>). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.The tetracyclines are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever. A human vaccine for Q fever is used in Australia, but it is not available in the United States. - Mod.ML][More information on this observed increase in Q fever in Israel including demographics, geographic distribution, and potential high risk exposures would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90>.][See Also:2016----Q fever - Australia (02): (VI) meat processing workers 20160824.4437074Q fever - Australia: (NS) vaccination 20160706.43284432015----Q fever - Australia: (NS) 20150717.35168012014----Q fever - USA (02): (OR) vaccination, comment 20140728.2641341Q fever - USA: (OR) 20140726.26369212005----Q fever - Israel 20050814.2378].................................................mpp/ml/mj/jh"
