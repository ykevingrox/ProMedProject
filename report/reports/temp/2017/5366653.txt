Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hong-kong-investigates-5th-japanese-encephalitis-local-transmission-95344/>Hong Kong health officials are investigating a local case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and urge the public to avoid going to rural areas from dusk till dawn when the vector [mosquito], which breeds in large water bodies such as rice paddies, is most active.According to the attending physician and the patient's family, the male patient, aged 59 with good past health, lives in Healthy Village, North Point. He has developed confusion and abnormal behavior since 11 Sep [2017]. He attended Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on 18 Sep [2017] and was found to have fever, left sided weakness and confusion and was admitted for management. He is now in stable condition.His cerebrospinal fluid tested positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against JE upon laboratory testing.Initial inquiries revealed that the patient had no travel history within the incubation period. His local movements before onset were mainly from his residence to Tsuen Wan to the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF) of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) for work. His home contacts have remained asymptomatic and have been put under medical surveillance.""As the patient is suffering from confusion and unable to provide further details of his exposure history, epidemiological investigations are ongoing,"" a spokesman for the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said.This is the 5th JE case recorded in 2017 and all were locally acquired, 4 of which were mosquito-borne and one was blood-borne. In 2016 and 2015, 2 (imported) and 2 (one local, one unclassified) cases, respectively, were recorded.JE is a mosquito-borne disease and the JE virus is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The principal vector is called _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_. JE mainly occurs in rural and agricultural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific. The infected mosquito transmits the JE virus to humans and animals during biting. The mosquitoes breed where there is abundant water such as rice paddies and become infected by feeding on pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus. Symptoms usually start around 4-14 days after being infected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Hong Kong area is well into the JE virus transmission season. There have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Hong Kong in past years. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow precautions to avoid mosquito bites.A JEV vaccine is available in China, but there has been a question concerning justification of massive campaigns in Hong Kong where clinical cases are very few.Maps of Hong Kong can be seen at <http://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/hongkong/hongkong-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>. - Mod.TY]
