She also noticed an eschar on the left thigh on the same day.She had returned from Zambia on [Wed 9 Aug 2017]. The last 7 days before the return flight were spent in the South Luangwa National Park (northern aspect), together with her husband. They went on game tours and described the area as being very wet due to a comparatively heavy rain season. She recalled several bites by tsetse flies during the time spent there.She presented to the Frankfurt University hospital emergency department on [16 Aug 2017] and blood was immediately taken and examined for parasites. Trypanosomes could be seen in a QBC microscopy and a thin film. Treatment with suramin was initiated and the case was brought to the attention of the WHO.The patient is suffering from human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), East African form. Her symptoms consisted of fever, headache, muscle aches and a very notable eschar. The patient had a remarkable pancytopenia initially.According the WHO, 8 cases of HAT were reported in Zambia in 2015 (<http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1637>). In 2015, a case of HAT was reported in a Canadian tourist who had also visited South Luangwa National Park (<http://www.promedmail.org/post/20150904.3625005>).Another 3 cases were described on ProMED-mail in 2010, all of which had visited South Luangwa NP [20101111.4093, 20101022.3833, and 20100915.3338]HAT is repeatedly affecting travelers to the African subcontinent, when they are exposed to tsetse flies. Clinically, an eschar can be an important clue to the diagnosis.--Professor Dr Timo Wolf Professor Gudrun Just-NueblingFrankfurt University HospitalInfectious Diseases GroupFrankfurtGermany<timo.wolf@kgu.de>[ProMED-mail thanks professors Wolf and Just-Nuebling for this communication.Zambia is endemic for African trypanosomiasis caused by _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_.
