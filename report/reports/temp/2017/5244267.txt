Romania Insider [edited]<https://www.romania-insider.com/two-romanians-anthrax/>Two Romanians, husband and wife, were admitted to the Victor Babes Infectious Diseases Hospital in Craiova, after laboratory tests showed that they were infected with anthrax, local News.ro has reported.The 2 went to the Emergency County Hospital, Craiova on 4 Aug 2017 with several hand injuries. They were admitted to the hospital, and tests later confirmed that both of them were infected with anthrax.The doctors decided to transfer them to the hospital of infectious diseases, where they are receiving the appropriate treatment.The authorities will conduct an epidemiological investigation at their home, as it is believed that the 2 got sick after coming into contact with infected animals.Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_, according to information posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come into contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. Signs and symptoms can range from skin sores to vomiting and shock. Rapid treatment with antibiotics can cure most anthrax infections.[Byline: Irina Marica]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Romania can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/61081>. There are 2 Craiova's in Romania, which makes it hard to place: in Arad <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/02/Craiova.html>; and in Dolj <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/17/Craiova.html>. As the latter is in central Romania and the former in the northwest, where anthrax cases are more frequently seen, I would guess it is the Arad Craiova.With hand lesions, this is a typical scenario for 2 people butchering an animal sick or dead from anthrax. As multiple animals were affected, as indicated in this report (""sick animals""), they were probably sick sheep. - Mod.MHJ]
