However, when he presented with the illness, he went to a health assistance center. That center carried out a rapid test for the virus that was positive.The progression of the disease was rapid and sudden. The victim died in recent hours and it is stated that his medical history was sent to the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia.If this information is confirmed, it will be the 2nd case so far this year [2017] in La AraucanÌ a region.[Byline: Nicole Briones]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This case illustrates how rapidly hantavirus infections can progress from febrile illness to fatal hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Medical attention needs to be sought as early as possible. As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the Araucania region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides little information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3678>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5111>.]
