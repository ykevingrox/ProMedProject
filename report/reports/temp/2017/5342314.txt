A total of 4 people have received medical care at home, while 52 others have been hospitalized, said Lviv regional administration in a statement.A person remains in critical condition in intensive care and 13 are in serious condition, while the rest are in stable condition, the statement added. All victims were diagnosed with an acute enteric infection. They fell ill after eating smoked fish purchased in a local market.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[There is not enough information regarding this foodborne outbreak to suggest a diagnosis. ProMED would like more information about the outbreak including the incubation period, the presence of absence of fever and what symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or any extra-gastrointestinal symptoms occurred. That the food was smoked fish, it is not known what fish or if it was gutted before being smoked, brings up the possibility of botulism which can present with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms. (Sobel J, Malavet M and John S: Outbreak of clinically mild botulism type E illness from home-salted fish in patients presenting with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms. Clin Infect Did 2007;45: e14-e16; available at <http://bit.ly/2yr3MrE>).Type E botulism is the type generally associated with marine-derived food such as fermented seal or whale blubber or smoked or salted fish (especially if the fish is not gutted). There are 7 classical botulinum toxins, A through G with almost all human cases due to A, B or E. In 2013, a group in California found what seemed like a new toxin, type H, but when the protein was eventually sequenced, it was found to be a combination of 2 existing toxins: a subtype of toxin F with a piece of toxin A. However, recently in 2017, a new toxin was described:Zhang S, Masuyer G, Zhang J, et al: Identification and characterization of a novel botulinum neurotoxin. Nature Communications 2017;8: doi:10.1038/ncomms14130; available at <https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14130>.Abstract--------""Botulinum neurotoxins are known to have 7 serotypes (BoNT/A-G). Here we report a new BoNT serotype, tentatively named BoNT/X, which has the lowest sequence identity with other BoNTs and is not recognized by antisera against known BoNTs. Similar to BoNT/B/D/F/G, BoNT/X cleaves vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP) 1, 2 and 3, but at a novel site (Arg66-Ala67 in VAMP2). Remarkably, BoNT/X is the only toxin that also cleaves non-canonical substrates VAMP4, VAMP5 and Ykt6. To validate its activity, a small amount of full-length BoNT/X was assembled by linking 2 non-toxic fragments using a transpeptidase (sortase). Assembled BoNT/X cleaves VAMP2 and VAMP4 in cultured neurons and causes flaccid paralysis in mice. Thus, BoNT/X is a novel BoNT with a unique substrate profile. Its discovery posts a challenge to develop effective countermeasures, provides a novel tool for studying intracellular membrane trafficking, and presents a new potential therapeutic toxin for modulating secretions in cells.""The strain was originally identified from an infant botulism patient in Japan in 1996. It is very noteworthy that it is not inactivated by any of the current antibodies against the other botulinum toxins. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9359>.]
