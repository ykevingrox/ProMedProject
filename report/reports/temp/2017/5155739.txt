Dawn [edited]<https://www.dawn.com/news/1343576/chaman-infant-diagnosed-with-polio>A polio case has been detected in Chaman, a town along the Pak-Afghan border in Qila Abdullah district.In 2016, 20 cases were reported from across the country out of which 2 were from Qila Abdullah.The 18-month-old son of a resident of Mohalla Rah Mohammad in Mehmoodabad, was diagnosed with the poliovirus on [Mon 3 Jul 2017] in what is being termed by the health officials as the 1st case reported in Balochistan this year [2017].On [Wed 5 Jul 2017], the health department claimed that the child's mother and grandmother had refused to get him vaccinated. They said the boy had hardly received 2 to 3 doses of the vaccine since he was born.The child's father said that they got alarmed when [the boy] was running a high fever and was constipated. He was taken to a local dispensary and later to the children's hospital in the area, where doctors suspected the child was suffering from the crippling disease. Health officials said that after the child's stool samples were taken and other medical tests were carried out, it was confirmed that he was suffering from polio.The next polio eradication campaign in the province is scheduled for [24 Jul 2017].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail (Alerted to case by HealthMap Alert)<promed@promedmail.org>[The media report suggests that the stool specimens were positive for poliovirus but does not mention the genetic typing whether the virus is a wild poliovirus (WPV) or a vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV). [According to the EpiCore report below it is WPV1 - Mod.LM] The below weekly report from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) does not mention the above case, suggesting the genetic typing of the virus was most likely still pending at the time of the report. It should be noted that this case comes from a town by the Pakistan/Afghanistan border, a region that has been identified as high risk for poliovirus transmission, where there have been periodic positive environmental samples. Using the drafted version of this post, I sent an RFI out to the EpiCore Surveillance Project members and received responses with the information I had requested.  See below.The media report does mention the family withheld vaccination from the child that had possibly received less than 3 doses - a pity. This part of Pakistan is one of the areas with high resistance to vaccination and where there has been periodic violence directed towards vaccination workers. [The EpiCore report below supports that vaccine refusal was involved in this case. - Mod.LM]A map showing the location of Chaman town near the Afghan border can be found at <https://i1.wp.com/www.politicpk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Killa-Abdullah-District-Map-with-Tehsils-Complete.gif?fit=688%2C600&ssl=1>.

The child is from a refusal family.  The mother hides the child as per the grandfather's pressure. It is from a district Killah Abdullah in the same UC [Union Council] which reported a last case in 2016.Responding Member: Dr. Muhammad Hakim FELTP Pakistan--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project Members[Our thanks goes out to the EpiCore Surveillance Project members Drs. Zulficar Ali and Muhammad Hakim for their rapid replies to our RFI for more information on the laboratory findings on this case.  As this case had a WPV1 isolated, genetic testing on the isolate might assist in identifying where this virus was last identified. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Global - GPEIDate: Thu 6 Jul 2017Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Poliovirus Weekly Update5-Jul-2017, World Health OrganizationNew wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 6Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37New cVDPV cases reported this week: 2Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 28Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5Headlines- On [1 Jul 2017], Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus began his 5-year term as the World Health Organization's (WHO) new Director-General. In his introductory speech to WHO staff, he emphasised his commitment to seeing the last case of polio during his tenure.- The GPEI offers sincere thanks to polio eradication pioneer and leader Dr Margaret Chan, who has retired from her role as Director-General of WHO.- The Korea Foundation for International Healthcare is supporting efforts to improve surveillance in one of the last remaining strongholds of the poliovirus. - Ambassador Carole Lanteri, of the Permanent Mission of Monaco, handed over to Ambassador/Deputy Permanent Representative Mitsuko Shino, of the Permanent Mission of Japan, as co-chair of the Polio Partners Group in June [2017].- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan - 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples. Syria - 2 new circulating vaccine-derived type 2 polioviruses (cVDPV2) isolated from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases and 6 new cVDPV2s isolated from contacts. See country-specific section below, for more details.Afghanistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 4. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [16 Apr 2017] from Nawzad district, Hilmand province.- With most of Afghanistan polio-free, efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen operations, in close coordination with Pakistan, to address remaining low-level transmission in the common reservoir area of the Quetta-Kandahar transmission corridor.- Afghanistan is carrying out a programme review focusing on the implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan and making necessary adjustments for the 2nd half of 2017.Pakistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 2. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [13 Feb 2017], from Diamir district, Gilgit Baltistan. - A total of 2 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Peshawar district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and from Rawalpindi district of Punjab, both with collection date [10 Jun 2017].- The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan.Nigeria- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country.- The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighbouring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger.- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. Central Africa- No new cases were reported in the past week. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is affected by 2 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), in Haut Lomami province (2 cases, with onset of paralysis on [8 Mar 2017 and 20 Feb 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [2 May 2017]). - Outbreak response plans are currently being finalised, with supplementary immunization activities using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.- The 1st mOPV2 campaign was implemented last week ([27-29 Jun 2017]) targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 years in the 2 affected provinces.- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.- DR Congo is also affected by an Ebola outbreak, in Bas Uele province in the north of the country. Coordination among both outbreak response teams will be necessary and teams are already working on this. [WHO has announced the outbreak of Ebola has ended (see <http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/9744-who-declares-an-end-to-the-ebola-outbreak-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo.html>. - Mod.MPP]Syrian Arab Republic- In Syria, 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week, bringing the total of cVDPV2 cases to 24. All cases had onset of paralysis between [3 Mar 2017 and 28 May 2017]. A total of 22 of the cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir-Al-Zour governorate, and 2 cases are from Raqua and Talabyad districts, Raqua governorate. Additionally, 6 cVDPV2s were also isolated from contacts, all from Mayadeen district (collected in May and June [2017]). - Confirmation of these latest cases is not unexpected at this time and does not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Although access to Deir-Al-Zour is compromised due to insecurity, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, 2 campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using the bivalent oral polio vaccine ([bOPV]). However, only limited coverage was possible through these campaigns. In response to the isolation of cVDPV2 from Raqua governorate, the Syrian Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF is considering adding the area to the outbreak response. This is under discussion due to ongoing military operations.Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 4 Jul 2017Total global cases in 2017: 6 (compared with 19 for the same period in 2016)- Total in endemic countries in 2017: 6 (compared with 19 for the same period in 2016)- Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016)- Afghanistan: 4 cases in 2017 (compared with 6 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 16 Apr 2017- Pakistan: 2 cases in 2017 (compared with 13 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 13 Feb 2017- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21 Aug 2016Total global cases in 2016: 37- Total in endemic countries: 37- Total in non-endemic countries: 0Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 4 Jul 2017Total global cases in 2017: 28 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016)- Syrian Arab Republic: 24 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 May 2017- Democratic Republic of the Congo: 4 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 18 Apr 2017- Pakistan: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016- Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016Total global cases in 2016: 5- Total in endemic countries: 2- Total in non-endemic countries: 3--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Note that the case mentioned in the media report in section [1] above is not reflected in this weekly GPEI update. As the local media in Pakistan has been good at reporting on positive polio cases (and not necessarily as yet unconfirmed cases of AFP - acute flaccid paralysis), we suspect that this case will appear in future weekly GPEI updates.As mentioned in previous posts related to the ongoing outbreak of cVDPV2 associated polio in Syria, there were a total of 65 identified cases of AFP in the affected region of whom 22 had been ruled out (not due to poliovirus). With the above confirmation of 2 new cases there have now been 24 confirmed cases of paralytic poliomyelitis attributable to the cVDPV2. There are also an addition 6 individual who were tested as part of contact tracing that were found to have asymptomatic cVDPV infections. The above report from the GPEI confirms the media report from yesterday's ProMED-mail report on a 2nd case in Raqqah, confirming that the cVDPV2 responsible for this outbreak is now circulating in Raqqah governorate.The WHO/GPEI map showing the locations of all confirmed cases of poliomyelitis in 2017 (and linkable to 2016) can be found at: <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.For a map of Syria showing provinces, see <http://www.emapsworld.com/images/syria-provinces-map.gif>.
