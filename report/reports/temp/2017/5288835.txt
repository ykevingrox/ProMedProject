CBS2 New York [edited]<http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/08/30/staten-island-ticks/>A cluster of Lyme disease cases on Staten Island is causing concern after one woman wound up with spinal meningitis because of a tick bite.CBS2's Brian Conybeare spoke exclusively with the patient, who wants everyone to be aware of the dangers Ã¥ - even in the city. The growing deer population has long been a problem on Staten Island. ""We have deer that walk down our street like they own,"" [the woman] said. ""They're beautiful, but they're not so pretty anymore."" She was bitten by a deer tick, which her doctors say infected her with Lyme disease.Since she went undiagnosed for 4 months, it developed into spinal meningitis. ""It's the most excruciating pain I've ever had in my life,"" she told Conybeare. After about 2 weeks in the hospital, [she] now has an IV port in her arm to administer daily doses of heavy duty antibiotics. She lives south of Hylan Boulevard near Wolfe's Pond Park. Drone Force 2 captured images of the open spaces in the park along the south shore of Staten Island and the densely wooded area, where more and more deer live and breed, despite a USD 2 million sterilization program launched by the city last year [2016]. [The patient] says 6 other people in the Hugenot Beach neighborhood have also been diagnosed with tickborne diseases this summer [2017], and something has to be done.""Check yourself for ticks,"" Rep Daniel Donovan (R-NY) said. On [Wed 30 Aug 2017], the congressman announced a new bill for a pilot program to track deer ticks nationwide and even allow people to send pictures of ticks they pull off their bodies to professional scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""That professional would respond within 72 hours with information about the type of tick and the risks of what diseases they may incur from that tick,"" he explained. They would also tell you what questions to ask your doctor, Conybeare reported. That's something [the patient] and her neighbors certainly could have used. Experts say you should always use insect repellent when outdoors and check yourself and your kids for ticks when you go back inside.[Byline: Brian Conybeare, Daniel Donovan, John Montone]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Deer play no role in infecting black-legged ticks, the vector for Lyme disease, with the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, _Borrelia burgdorferi_, because deer are not carriers of this bacterium. Tick larvae and nymphs typically become infected with Lyme disease bacteria when feeding on infected small mammals such as white-footed mice, the principal reservoir for _B. burgdorferi_. Adult female ticks may feed on medium- to large-sized animal hosts for a blood meal that is required for egg production, but deer are their principal hosts. Deer also supply the tick with a place to mate. Deer may have at least 10 to 50 female ticks attaching and dropping off each day during the season when adult ticks are active. Each female tick then lays around 2000 eggs and dies. Eggs will produce larvae free of borrelia.The infected female ticks that drop from deer present little danger to humans or other animals since the ticks are now at the end of their life cycle and will not feed again. The nymph more often transmits infection to people; because of their small size, we do not notice the nymphs or their bite.Deer reduction has been examined as a method to manage tick abundance and tick-borne diseases (<http://www.ct.gov/caes/lib/caes/documents/publications/fact_sheets/entomology/deer_&_ticks_fact_sheet.pdf>). However, reducing the deer population has not always resulted in a significant fall in the tick population or fall in the incidence of Lyme disease in humans (<https://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/are-deer-the-culprit-in-lyme-disease/>).New York City comprises 5 county-level divisions called boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. A map of the 5 boroughs can be found at <http://tinyurl.com/y7ca3kk7>. Charlie Calisher reminded me that Manhattan is called New York County, the Bronx is Bronx county, Brooklyn is Kings county, Queens is Queens county, and Staten Island is Richmond county.Staten Island, in the southwest part of the city, is the least populated of the boroughs; it has a large and diverse population of wildlife, including white tailed deer (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1460>.]
