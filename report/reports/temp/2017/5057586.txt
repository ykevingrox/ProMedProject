As Dr Berger comments, changes in rates of TBE incidence in both Latvia and Estonia could be due to a variety of factors.ProMED thanks Dr Berger for his comments, graph and reference.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Latvia and Estonia can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/119>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/119>.][See Also:Tick-borne encephalitis virus - Latvia 20170522.50551512015----Tick-borne disease - Russia: (Kaliningrad) TBE & Lyme 20150324.32504752005 ----Tick-borne encephalitis - Estonia 20050828.25472004----Tick-borne encephalitis - Europe: update 20040715.1919Tick-borne encephalitis - EU (Czech Rep., Latvia, Lithuania) 20040624.1677].................................................lxl/ty/ec/lxl/lm"
