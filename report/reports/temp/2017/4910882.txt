The cases were 6 cases from Guangxi, 5 cases in Hunan, 3 cases each from Guangdong and Guizhou, 2 cases in Henan, and one case each from Jiangxi and Fujian. Among them, 18 were known to have exposure to poultry or poultry markets.According to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection, 1307 cumulative human cases have been reported since 2013 as of [11 Mar 2017].In addition, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations said today [17 Mar 2017] that a resurgent outbreak of a new strain of avian influenza that can be lethal for humans underscores the need for robust and rapid detection and response systems at animal source.The need for ongoing targeted and widespread monitoring and effective response to detections remains urgent to keep the virus from spreading beyond China's Eastern and Southeastern regions, where it is now considered endemic.""Considering the potential for mutation of avian influenza virus, constant surveillance by national Veterinary Services of the different strains circulating in animals in their country is essential to protect both animal and human health"", explains Matthew Stone, Deputy Director General of the OIE.""To protect human health and people's livelihoods, it is essential to tackle the disease at its source in poultry: efforts need to target eliminating H7N9 from affected farms and markets,"" said Vincent Martin, FAO's Representative in China.""Targeted surveillance to detect the disease and clean infected farms and live bird markets, intervening at critical points along the poultry value chain -- from farm to table -- is required. There should be incentives for everybody involved in poultry production and marketing to enforce disease control.""[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Undoubtedly, the recent 5th wave of human infections with influenza A/H7N9 has shown a much higher case count in various provinces of China. Continuing implementation of control measures in poultry markets coupled with dissemination of information to general public on preventive measures would be helpful in containing the spread. - Mod.UBAMaps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
