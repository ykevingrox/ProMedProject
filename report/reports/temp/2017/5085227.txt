Otago Daily Times [edited]<https://www.odt.co.nz/regions/central-otago/pertussis-cases-spike-then-ease>A spike in pertussis in Central Otago may be due to greater awareness or part of a national cycle, Southern District Health Board (SDHB) medical officer of health Dr Naomi Gough says. Notifications of suspected pertussis, also known as whooping cough, and confirmed cases in Central Otago had both increased since about March [2017], Dr Gough said.She said in Otago there would normally be 3 or 4 notifications of suspected pertussis, which typically included 1 or 2 confirmed cases, every week. In the past 3 weeks there had been 25 notifications of possible pertussis in Central Otago, of which 6 were confirmed. Most of those were from people who had in fact been sick about a month ago, and the spike had now settled, Dr Gough said.There had also been a spike in Central Otago in March [2017], and in Dunedin and Invercargill earlier in the year [2017]. There had been no increase in pertussis this year in Queenstown or Wanaka.Dr Gough said the reasons for the increase could be twofold. The first group of reasons was increased awareness of pertussis, the SDHB asking GPs to report all cases of suspected pertussis, and improvement in the testing for pertussis.Secondly, there seemed to be a 4-yearly cycle of pertussis outbreaks nationally. The last significant outbreak in Central Otago was about 4 years ago, Dr Gough said. She said it was important to note pertussis was always in the community and its circulation and spikes were normal, although the SDHB was increasingly noticing clusters of pertussis in communities.But it was also important to remember how highly contagious the bacterial infection was, and the importance of taking adequate measures if someone got sick with it. People with pertussis were typically contagious for about 3 weeks and could be prescribed a 5-day course of antibiotics. They were advised to stay at home until they had finished taking the antibiotics.It could be ''annoying'' to have to stay at home, but whooping cough was very dangerous to young unimmunised babies and to older people and those who were undergoing chemotherapy or had otherwise compromised immune systems, Dr Gough said. She said some people with pertussis had only minor coughing and might not realise they had the disease.She recommended families check their immunisations were up-to-date, and also consider getting influenza vaccinations.[Byline: Pam Jones]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Otago is a region of New Zealand in the south of the South Island; Central Otago is an informal name for the inland part of the Otago region <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Otago>.

County health officials now are trying to control the spread of the disease.The whooping cough outbreak has been going on for at least a couple of weeks in the Amish community near Seymour, even leading to the hospitalization of 2 babies. A total of 6 cases are confirmed, while there are many more possible cases in the Amish community along Highway C.""The challenge came because you have to go to them; they don't really have the means to hear or see about it through the news, the media,"" said Banks. The Webster County Health Unit used word of mouth and set up an immunization clinic at a country store last week. In 2 days, they vaccinated more than 300 adults and children. ""We're hoping that our actions and our control measures really counteracted against the spread of it. They told us what was going on,"" said Banks.Pharmacist Rebecca Kime at Downtown Drug in Seymour started hearing the signature cough about a week ago. ""Yep, we have; a lot of Purell, lot of Lysol wipe-downs,"" said Kime. At Downtown Drug, the antibiotic used to treat whooping cough has been flying out the door. Just in the past week, they've handed out about 200 prescriptions for azithromycin. ""They also were treating all the children in the family, and sometimes you've got 13, 14 kids in a family,"" said Kime. The favored herbal treatment has also sold out.So far, no confirmed cases are outside the Amish community, and health officials have not even seen any cases in the Amish community along Highway A.[Byline: Linda Russell, Tim Leimkuhler]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The Amish settled in Webster County in 1968, acquiring many old rundown farms <http://seymourmochamber.com/htm/amish.htm>.

The school, however, only advised its community about 1 of the cases in its latest newsletter yesterday [Mon 22 May 2017]. Both students, who are recovering at home, were vaccinated against the airborne bacterial disease at early ages.There have been 45 cases of whooping cough or pertussis in the Cairns health district since the start of the year [2017], compared to a yearly average of 86 cases. Cairns Tropical Public Health Services director Dr Richard Gair said information about whooping cough had been distributed to the school and a letter provided for distribution to families.However, he said national guidelines for responding to a whooping cough case did not focus on a community-wide response, such as that relevant to dengue fever or the Zika virus, with the response instead targeting follow-up of ""close risk contacts"". A Department of Education and Training spokesman said the principal of Gordonvale State advised parents and carers yesterday about a confirmed case of whooping cough.[Byline: Daniel Bateman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Cairns, with a population of 147 993 residents, is a major city on the east coast of Far North Queensland in Australia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns>.

The objective of this study was to estimate in this region the vaccine effectiveness (VE) in protecting newborns against laboratory-confirmed pertussis infection. A matched case-control study was undertaken in the period between [1 Mar 2015] and [29 Feb 2016]. A total of 22 cases and 66 controls (plus or less 15 days of age difference) were included in the study. Cases were non-vaccinated infants less than 3 months of age at disease onset testing positive for pertussis by real-time PCR. For every case 3 unvaccinated controls were selected. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by multiple conditional logistic regression for association between maternal vaccination and infant pertussis. Other children in the household, as well as mother- and environmental covariates were taken into account. The VE was calculated as 1 minus OR. Mothers of 5 cases (23 percent) and of 41 controls (62 percent) were vaccinated during pregnancy. The adjusted VE was 90.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 56.6 to 98.1). The only covariate in the final model was breastfeeding (protective effect). Our study provides evidence in favour of pertussis vaccination programmes for pregnant women in order to prevent whooping cough in infants aged less than 3 months.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[For a discussion of pertussis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA: (CA) fatal 20150115.3093551 and my colleague Mod.LL's comments in Pertussis - USA (06) 20160917.4495935. - Mod.ML]
