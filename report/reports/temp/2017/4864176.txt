ADPH is investigating these notifiable disease cases and working closely with UA to contact potentially exposed people.   Description:  The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) was recently notified by the University of Alabama (UA) Student Health Center that several students had been diagnosed with mumps. ADPH is investigating these notifiable disease cases and working closely with UA to contact potentially exposed people.While UA has a highly vaccinated population of students, mumps can still occur in vaccinated communities, particularly in close-contact settings such as schools, colleges and camps. However, high vaccination coverage helps to limit the size, duration and spread of mumps.During this investigation, ADPH recommends that UA students, faculty and staff not vaccinated with two doses of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), immediately receive a second MMR at Student Health Center, their doctor, or health department. ADPH strongly recommends students who do not have any record of MMR and decline to be vaccinated should not attend class for 25 days after exposure to mumps.In 2016, Alabama reported only one case of mumps.Out of an abundance of caution, ADPH and UA have begun notifying the campus community about mumps, prevention tips, and vaccinations.--Communicated by:ProMED-mailpromed@promedmail.org[This is not a publicly available report at this time.

He said they will be administered through the campus clinic to students who were exposed.Students were exposed to the virus 27 Jan at Rudy's Pub & Grill in Newport Beach, according to a Chapman University health alert issued Friday. University officials are encouraging students who attended the event and who may have been exposed to remain vigilant and get medical care if they experience symptoms.The incubation period for the mumps virus is usually 12 to 25 days, which means it could take weeks for symptoms to develop, Zahn said. Mumps usually starts out with flu-like symptoms such as fever and muscle aches.""After a couple of days, you start to feel the classic symptoms of pain and swelling along the jaw line,"" he said.There is no treatment for mumps other than pain medication as it resolves on its own. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mumps spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose or throat.An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing or talking; by sharing items such as cups or beverages; through intimate contact; or by touching surfaces with unwashed hands.Orange County sees about 10 cases of mumps annually, Zahn said. Unlike measles, it's not a disease that is considered eradicated from the United States, he said.""But getting vaccinated can help protect you,"" he said.[Byline: Deepa Bharath] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from Healthmap Alertspromed@promedmail.org******[3] PennsylvaniaDate: Sat 25 Feb 2017Source: Altoona Mirror [edited]<http://www.altoonamirror.com/uncategorized/2017/02/health-department-working-with-psu-on-mumps-cases/>Health department working with PSU [Penn State University] on mumps cases------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Pennsylvania Department of Health is investigating mumps cases on Penn State University's main campus.The health department won't release details because of confidentiality rules, but Penn State says the 1st confirmed case was reported 29 Jan [2017].

One anonymous submitter stated that several cases have been noted in Kansas since Thanksgiving [November] 2016.  Over Thanksgiving vacation, there was a party at The University of Kansas, Lawrence, with some University of Missouri students who came down with mumps while there. In addition, cases have been reported in high school wrestlers across Kansas,  and in a Mother in Johnson County, KS infected by her child who attended school at the University of Missouri.[ProMED thanks the submitter for this information.]B. Dr. Dirk Haselow [Arkansas Department fo Health] submitted a response to the RFI:I noticed a quote from an interview that I gave some time ago included in the thread.  An important omission is as follows.  While we have seen a higher than expected rate of parotitis in persons who have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine, we have seen exceptionally low rates of severe manifestations among our 2820 cases.  (0 meningitis, 0 encephalitis, 1 pancreatitis, 5 hospitalizations, and 17 orchitis)  Lumped together, these severe manifestations have occurred at roughly 100 fold lower rates than expected if our population was unvaccinated.  The vaccine, while not perfect, clearly is working well to prevent severe disease. We are in the process of conducting a study with CDC to estimate effectiveness of a 2nd dose and (in some cases a 3rd dose booster) in our outbreak. --Dirk Haselow, MD, PhDState Epidemiologist and Outbreak Response Medical DirectorArkansas Department of Health4815 W. Markham St., Slot 48Little Rock, AR 72205(o) 501-537-8969(f) 501-661-2300[ProMED thanks Dr. Haselow for his important note. We have pointed out the lack of severe symptoms vaccinated individuals experience following infection with mumps in comments in the past, most recently in Mumps update (01): USA (WA,TX) Archive Number: 20170110.4753366 -  ""Even though mumps cases occur even in fully vaccinated children and adults, the occurrence of the more severe complications is relatively rare now, evidence of some protection afforded by the vaccine.""  Nonetheless, this is an important point to make frequently as it further supports the MMR vaccine's effectiveness even when full protection does not occur.One paper among others that discusses the problem of genetic variation in the SH gene of mumps virus is Echevarr√å a JE et al. Mumps Virus Genotyping: Basis and Known Circulating Genotypes. The Open Vaccine Journal, 2010, 3, 37-41.  Although the 12 genotypes of mumps virus currently recognized by the WHO are considered to be the same serotype, lack of full cross-protection between different genotypes has been reported and has been suggested as a cause of vaccine failure. However, other reports did not find this lack of cross reaction among different genotypes. Jerryl-Lynn and Rubini vaccine strains belong to genotype A which is genetically distant from the other genotypes. Wild strains belonging to the A genotype used to be dominant before vaccination, but nowadays most MV wild strains belong to other genotypes. The genetic distance between genotype A vaccine strains and non-A wild strains has been proposed to be a determinant factor in vaccine failure. On the other hand, non-A vaccines have been more frequently associated with post vaccination meningitis and are considered less safe. Additional studies are needed to obtain a better balance between efficiency and safety in order to establish the best future strategy for achieving optimal vaccine efficacy. Data from neutralization experiments are still unclear.Also, from Gouma S et al. 2016. Mumps-specific cross-neutralization by MMR vaccine-induced antibodies predicts protection against mumps virus infection. Vaccine 34(35):4166. Recent mumps outbreaks have been] dominated by mumps genotype G virus strains, whereas the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain of the MMR vaccine belongs to genotype A. It has been shown previously that vaccinated persons develop sufficient neutralizing antibodies against wild type mumps genotype G virus, although the neutralization capacity is lower against the wild type strain as compared with the vaccine strain. However, no correlate of protection has been defined so far that distinguishes MMR vaccinated persons with sufficient immunological protection from those who are not protected against mumps virus infection.
