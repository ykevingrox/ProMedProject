The Western Cape Department of Health said on Thursday that it had identified five confirmed measles cases at a school in the town. ""These cases received the necessary medical treatment and the patients are recoveringÛ "" said the provincial government in a statement.""Measles is a notifiable disease and all cases of suspected measles need to be investigated. It is of vital importance that notifiable illnesses are reported immediately to contain the spread of the illness.""The Department is currently following up the cases and vaccination is offered to all at-risk contacts. Depending on the number of casesÛ  the Department may institute mass vaccination at schools and other institutions."" Health facilities and practitioners in the provinces are on high alert for any further suspected measles cases. ParentsÛ  guardiansÛ  caregivers and schools were requested to take all people with the signs and symptoms of measles to their nearest clinic.Parents are urged to:---------------------- Check their child's immunisation status.- Ensure that every child is immunised according to the schedule.- Contact their local clinic if they or their children had been in contact with a person diagnosed with measles.- Consistently apply hygienic practicesÛ  especially washing of hands.What is measles?----------------Measles is a highly infectious viral disease. The first sign is a high fever followed by a blotchy red rash all over the body. It is also accompanied by cough or a runny nose or red eyes. Measles can cause dangerous complicationsÛ  such as infection of the lungsÛ  blindness and even death.It is caused by a small germ called the measles virus. It spreads when a person with measles coughs or sneezes.Why is measles a dangerous disease?------------------------------------Young children who survive measles are weakened by the disease and may later die from malnutrition or other illnesses. Measles is also an important cause of mental retardation and blindness. A quarter of all deaths from measles occur before the age of 1 year.Measles in older children usually occurs as outbreaksÛ  when large groups of children get measles at the same time. The risk of a measles outbreak is higher when groups of children gather together for example in crÌ¬chesÛ  day care centres and at schools.What to do if you suspect that you or your child has measles? Take the person to the nearest clinicÛ  hospital or your doctor.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap of South Africa can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11745>. - Mod.LK]******[2] USA (New Jersey)Date: Tue 31 Jan 2017, 2:25 PM ETSource: Patch [edited]<http://patch.com/new-jersey/wayne/annual-number-n-j-measles-cases-fast-approaching-recent-2-year-total>The number of measles cases in New Jersey this year [2017] is fast approaching the total from the previous 2 years [2015 and 2016] and it isn't even February yet.There have already been 2 confirmed measles cases in New Jersey this year. An unvaccinated 7-month-old was diagnosed in Wayne earlier this month [January 2017]. In a separate incident, a Hudson County man may have exposed individuals at several public places in Jersey City. There were no reported cases last year [2016] and just 3 the year before that [2015].The recent cases were reported after the man and the baby traveled overseas. The cases are not related, state health officials previously said.Dawn Thomas, a spokesperson with the state Department of Health, said that ""occasionally"" measles cases are reported in New Jersey and stressed the need for people to be vaccinated. ""Two doses of measles vaccine are more than 99 percent effective in preventing measles,"" Thomas said. ""Residents that think they were exposed to the individuals in Hudson and Passaic counties should contact a healthcare provider.""Number of Measles Cases Year 2016 - 0; 2015 - 3; 2014 - 3; 2013 - 15; 2012 - 2; 2011 - 4.[Byline: Daniel Hubbard]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap of the US showing the locations of New Jersey can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106> - Mod.LK]******[3] MyanmarDate: Wed 8 Feb 2017Source: Myanmar Times [edited]<http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/yangon/24861-anti-measles-campaign-in-five-yangon-townships.html>Dr Win Lwin, Regional Director of Department of Public Health, said yesterday [Tue 7 Feb 2017] that the department aimed to vaccinate all children aged between 9 months and 15 years in the 5 townships, where most of the cases occurred.""The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. Cooperation of the public and organisations is needed and we would like all children to get vaccinated,"" said Dr Win Lwin. The campaign started on [Mon 6 Feb 2017] and will continue until [Mon 20 Feb 2017] in the townships of Hlaing Tharyar, Twante, Insein, Kyeemyindaing and Thaketa, according to the department.Dr Win Lwin said Hlaing Tharyar, which has 20 wards and 9 villages, is a populous area with low vaccine coverage, especially among migrant workers. According to the Public Health Department, 98 measles cases were found last month [January 2017] in 20 townships in Yangon Region. A total of 50 of the cases were from Hlaing Tharyar township. Health officials said protection against measles is necessary because it is an infectious disease.Dr Than Tun Aung, deputy director general of Department of Public Health said the campaign was implemented to protect and prevent the disease from spreading to other areas. ""Every child should take part in the vaccination programme to protect against the disease. Measles can be dangerous when children who do not have enough nutrition are infected and develop 2ary health problems,"" said Dr Than Tun Aung.A spokesperson from Hlaing Tharyar township's Health Department said they are trying to cover all wards and villages in the township. The Department of Public Health has been implementing regular vaccination exercises for children aged 9 months and 18 months in the 1st week of every month in the townships.The symptoms of measles are fever, dry cough, sore throat, runny nose and red spots on the skin, and conjunctivitis.The government said last August [2016] that 56 people from Lahe township in Naga self-administrated zone (SAZ) had died due to a measles outbreak between June and August 2016, while 40 people from Nanyun township in Sagaing Region died due to malnutrition and related health problems.The government launched a measles vaccination program in Naga SAZ in August 2016 and vaccinated more than 15 000 children.[Byline: Myint Kay Thi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Myanmar can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/myanmar_map2.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54726> - Mod.LK]******[4] Australia (Sydney)Date: Tue 7 Feb 2017, 10:00 PM ESTSource: Daily Mail [edited]<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4202070/Measles-outbreak-warning-Sydney.html>Health authorities are urging residents to watch for measles symptoms after a young adult with the disease frequented Sydney hot spots.The young adult visited popular spots in Sydney's CBD, inner west and Baulkham Hills while infectious. The sufferer contracted the disease overseas but did not become infectious until returning to Sydney.Popular shopping centres Norton Plaza in Leichhardt and Stockland Mall in Baulkham Hills were visited at the end of January and early February [2017]. The young adult later went to a food court in Martin Place, burger joint Mary's in Newtown, the University of Sydney and PACT centre for emerging artists in Erskineville.Dr Vicky Sheppeard, Director Communicable Diseases NSW Health, said the person frequently used inner west train services and travelled on buses between Town Hall and Baulkham Hills.The sufferer was unknowingly infectious.Measles is highly contagious and is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease,' Dr Sheppeard said. Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.""This latest case highlights the importance of getting vaccinated to protect against the disease,"" Dr Sheppeard said. ""Those people who have not received 2 doses of measles vaccine are at particular risk of contracting the disease and should be alert to symptoms in the coming days and weeks.""The scare comes after 4 people were diagnosed with measles following an outbreak across Sydney in December [2016].A woman travelling from Bali to Sydney in January [2017] also contracted the disease in an unrelated case.[Byline: Tanya Li]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Australia can be found at <http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif> and < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/50182> - Mod.LK]******[5] Anti-vaxxersDate: Wed 8 Feb 2017Source: New York Times [edited]<https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/how-the-anti-vaxxers-are-winning.html?_r=0>It's looking as if 2017 could become the year when the anti-vaccination movement gains ascendancy in the United States and we begin to see a reversal of several decades in steady public health gains. The 1st blow will be measles outbreaks in America.Measles is one of the most contagious and most lethal of all human diseases. A single person infected with the virus can infect more than a dozen unvaccinated people, typically infants too young to have received their 1st measles shot. Such high levels of transmissibility mean that when the percentage of children in a community who have received the measles vaccine falls below 90 percent to 95 percent, we can start to see major outbreaks, as in the 1950s when 4 million Americans a year were infected and 450 died. Worldwide, measles still kills around 100 000 children each year. ...-more--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is highly recommended reading. It is an opinion piece in the New York Times by Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine, and Director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. He has been a strong advocate for vaccination of the population to protect public health. See the URL above for informative maps as well as the full article.ProMED has been reporting on the increasing number of measles cases not only in the US, but also in Pakistan and other locations world-wide. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease; most cases are a consequence of poor vaccine coverage, not vaccine failure. There is no reason for children to be put at risk by parents who do not understand the science behind safe vaccination. It is important that public health professionals communicate the importance of vaccination and especially, the safety of the vaccine. Even in countries with high vaccination rates, non-vaccinated individuals are at risk when they travel outside their country or when they come into contact with infected individuals in their own country. - Mod.LK]
