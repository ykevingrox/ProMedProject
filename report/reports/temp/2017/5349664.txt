Maravi Post [edited]<http://www.maravipost.com/malawi-cholera-hit-chikwawa-district-36-cases-registered/>Health authorities in Chikwawa have said they will embark on a cholera vaccination exercise from next week [week of Sun 1Oct 2017] as a response to the ever increasing cholera cases being registered in the district. The district has in the past 6 weeks registered a cholera outbreak which has caused panic and refuses to die with the recent occurrence reported at Chikwawa Secondary School where 3 have tested positive. The new cases have brought the number of all people affected by the disease in the district to 36.Chikwawa District Environmental Health Officer, Veronica Mkukumila attributed the increase in cholera cases to poor hygiene, noting that the 3 patients who were admitted to Chikwawa District Hospital have since been discharged. ""Apart from Chikwawa Secondary School, the other surrounding villages affected by cholera are Ling'awa in the area of Chief Kasisi, Julius, Lauji, and Chinangwa in the area of Chief Katunga and part of Mulilima,"" Mkukumila said in an interview on [Thu 28 Sep 2017].Mkukumila, therefore, appealed to non - governmental organizations and well-wishers to provide more safe drinking water and new toilets at Chikwawa Secondary School to protect the learners from further suffering from waterborne diseases. ""We also went to the school to carry out an awareness meeting on good hygiene practices. From next week, we are intending to conduct a cholera vaccination campaign targeting over 200 000 people in the district,"" Mkukumila added.Chikwawa Secondary School Head teacher, Flora Kaphamtengo alleged that the disease was brought to the school by a form one student believed to have had the cholera at home before reporting for classes at the school. Kaphamtengo, however, disclosed that due to the incident the school management have since scaled up good hygiene activities to ensure no student suffers from cholera again. ""We have taken this as a wake - up call. We have tightened the noose so that no single student contracts cholera again considering that the disease is lethal. We don't want to lose any of our dear learners,"" Kaphamtengo said[Byline: Special Absalom]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2] Cholera - SudanDate: Fri 29 Sep 2017Source: Radio Dabanga [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201709290255.html>The cholera epidemic that is sweeping Sudan has claimed further lives in Darfur and elsewhere across the country, however the Khartoum government, as well as some international agencies, still resolutely refer to 'acute watery diarrhea'.Volunteer activists and doctors reported to Radio Dabanga that 2 people died of cholera and 6 others were infected in the South Darfur capital of Nyala on [Tue 26 Sep 2017]. A doctor reported to Radio Dabanga that one of the deaths was in El Jebel district and the 2nd one was at El Wehda district in the city. The isolation centre of the nearby Kalma camp for the displaced persons recorded 2 new cases of cholera on 26 and 27 of September 2017. Salah Eisa, the general - secretary of camp Kalma, told Radio Dabanga that 4 of the infection cases were discharged from the centre, while 4 other cases have remained hospitalized at the centre for treatment. Two people died and 8 others were infected at camp Otash in South Darfur.On [Wed 27 Sep 2017], a woman and her son died of cholera at Murnei Hospital in West Darfur and 2 others were infected.In Khartoum, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health, Esam Abdallah confirmed that there are states continuing to record cases of 'acute watery diarrhea', including Khartoum which has recorded 5 cases during the past few days.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - Congo DRDate:  Fri 29 Sep 2017Source: CAJ News [edited]<http://cajnewsafrica.com/2017/09/29/drc-cholera-death-toll-surges-to-500/>A raging cholera outbreak has claimed left over 500 people dead in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The epidemic, which has infected more than 24 000 people since an outbreak erupted in the North Kivu province in June 2017, is projected to claim more lives with the rains imminent. The waterborne disease has so far spread to 20 of the Central African country's 26 provinces, reaching epidemic proportions in 11.Cholera is endemic in 6 provinces but the drought of recent months and the high mobility of the population owing to conflict in certain areas have resulted in a faster spread and a greater impact. It represents one of the largest cholera outbreaks seen in DRC.Doctors Without Borders is making frenetic efforts to halt the crisis in the most affected areas. ""Containing the epidemic is the main priority,"" Cisco Otero, head of mission in DRC, said. ""The rainy season is coming and that can spread the virus even faster and lead to a critical situation.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
