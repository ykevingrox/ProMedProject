Fox News [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/07/20/minnesota-boy-battles-same-e-coli-strain-that-killed-sister.html>A Minnesota boy is fighting for his life after he contracted a strain of _E. coli_, the same one that killed his younger sister earlier this week [week of 16-22 Jul 2017]. The boy, 5, and his sister, 3, of Wright County, were sickened by an infection called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ EHEC] on [Sun 9 Jul 2017], Fox 9 reported. The siblings battled symptoms including non-stop bloody stool and vomiting, eventually leading them into acute kidney failure.Last week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017], the young girl, who would have turned 4-years-old next month [August 2017], died when the Shiga toxin from the bacteria attacked the toddler's kidneys and neurological system. ""Her brain and heart were being damaged,"" her parents wrote on their donation site, CaringBridge. ""Our sweet sweet little girl lost the battle. ""We got to hold her free of tubes and snuggle and kiss her. She is the most amazing little girl in the world. Our hearts are aching with the deepest sadness,"" they wrote in the post.The parents said their son ""is still fighting"" despite the toxins reaching his neurological system. ""He has had a blood transfusion [and] is on kidney dialysis and may need platelets,"" the post read. ""He has a long road to recovery and we hope and pray the toxins stay away from his brain and heart and other organ systems.""It's unclear how the Minnesota siblings contracted the strain of _E. coli_ that led to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication caused by the bacterial infection, the Star Tribune reported. The family visited a local petting zoo recently before they became ill, but officials cautioned that the children could have been infected from various sources. The animals at the display were taken away as an ""abundance of precaution.""State health officials are investigating the source of the bacterium, according to Star Tribune.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly, and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some being defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).References:1.
