Shropshire Star [edited]<https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/health/2017/09/26/legionnaires-disease-at-ludlow-hotel-is-2015-case-linked-to-outbreak/>[A man], of Loughborough and his wife, stayed at The Feathers luxury hotel in Ludlow in May 2015. Within days of returning home, the 74-year-old, who regularly enjoyed a round of golf, was struck down with what doctors first thought was flu. But as he failed to get better they carried out further checks and then diagnosed him with the potentially fatal lung infection. And while he has partially recovered from the illness, he is no longer able to play his favourite pastime of a round of golf.When the couple heard about the latest outbreak of Legionnaire's [disease] at the historic hotel they wondered if the cases could be linked. Two weeks ago it was announced that The Feathers had been forced to close after a woman guest was struck down with Legionnaires' Disease and died in July [2017].Tests found the _Legionella_ bacteria in water samples from the hotel's plumbing system. Another guest also contracted the disease after staying at the hotel in April [2017].[The man's] wife said: ""When we heard the news about The Feathers we were concerned there could be a link between [my husband's] getting ill following a stay and the most recent cases. We thought it was too much of a coincidence. At the time [my husband] was ill, Public Health England was called and they could find no link to it here. They could not identify the source. When we saw the news about The Feathers, it was the place we stayed at the week before [my husband] was ill. We had come away for a short break with friends and we stayed at The Feathers for 2 nights. The air conditioner was directly outside our bedroom window. Perhaps that is how the droplets got to [my husband]. I feel that when [my husband] became ill, further checks should have been made to find out the source of the infection. Our home water supply was investigated at the time and proved to be clear so it is too much of a coincidence that the same has occurred again. We have informed Public Health UK and they are liaising with the West of England Public Health department.""Early symptoms of the disease include a 'flu-like' illness with muscle aches, tiredness, headaches, dry cough and fever, which can then lead to pneumonia. The bacteria is widely distributed in the environment and can be found in hot and cold water systems, and in forms of industrial and commercial water cooling systems.Professor Rod Thomson, Director for Public Health, Shropshire Council said: ""The Feathers Hotel is still closed whilst the necessary remedial work on the hot and cold water systems as identified by Public Health England and Shropshire Council is being carried out. The council, working closely with PHE, regularly meets with the hotel management to discuss the progress of the work and potential re-opening plans. The hotel however, will not reopen until this work has been completed to a satisfactory standard.""[Byline: Lucy Todman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Clusters of legionnaires' disease associated with travel are difficult to detect if a travel history is not sought because the travelers typically disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms. The above news report concerns a 74-year-old man who became ill 2 years ago with legionnaires' disease 1 week after staying at the Feathers Hotel and who now suspects that there is an ongoing environmental source of _Legionella_ at this hotel.A recent ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis - Europe (08): UK (England) fatal, hotel, recurrence 20170915.5318438) reported a fatal case of Legionnaires' disease in a Feathers Hotel guest in July 2017 that occurred despite prior remediation of the hotel's water system in April 2017 with subsequent negative _Legionella_ cultures. Remediation was done because the hotel's water system was suspected to be the environmental source for an initial case in April 2017. The 2 cases, one in April and the other in July 2017, were said to be linked by unspecified ""tests"", perhaps genotyping, and that the strain of _Legionella_ isolated in the hotel's water system was ""indistinguishable from the samples taken from the 2 cases."" The hotel is now closed for remediation.The Feathers Hotel, in Ludlow, Shropshire is an historic inn with Tudor half-timbered frontage that was originally constructed in 1619; a picture of the hotel is available at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathers_Hotel,_Ludlow>.
