Most people recover from the virus in 2-3 weeks. Measles can cause serious complications for infants, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.It doesn't appear that any of the women at the medium-security facility are pregnant and staff are checking to see if anyone at the jail has a compromised immune system.The infected person was an inmate at the jail who has since been released after serving their sentence, said Dr Robert Strang, the province's chief medical officer of health, on [Mon 8 May 2017].""Measles is a highly infectious disease,"" Strang said in an interview.""Even what we call shared air space, you're breathing the same air with somebody ... because of the movement of inmates within the facility, there's no way to say anybody who's in the building at the time as this individual could have been exposed. We're not saying they were, but we can't rule out for sure that they weren't.""Vaccinations were offered to inmates and staff at the facility on [Sun 7 May 2017]. Public health teams had to act fast to try and prevent the spread of the virus.Measles can live in a room for up to 2 hours. In a jail, where people share many common areas, the virus could spread very quickly, Strang said in a release.Vaccinating people with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine following exposure can help prevent transmission.Public health workers screened inmates and correctional staff to determine their immunization status and provide vaccinations to those who needed it.Strang said 200 people were screened Sunday night [7 May 2017] and 125 of them needed a repeat immunization.Staff with public health are also reaching out to volunteers and inmates who may have left the facility to make sure they are not sick.There have been 30 confirmed cases of the measles this year [2017] in Nova Scotia, spread among 2 separate outbreaks. The 1st outbreak was in January and February, while the current outbreak started in March.The release said the risk to the general public remains low as most people are protected from measles by vaccination.[Byline: David Burke]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Canada can be seen at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/60299>. - Mod.LK]******[3] OmanDate: Mon 8 May 2017Source: Muscat Daily [edited]<http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Oman/44-cases-of-measles-registered-till-April-end-Ministry-of-Health-50m4#ixzz4gbFHsjxz>The Ministry of Health on [Mon 8 May 2017] said that there has been an outbreak of measles in the country and announced the start of a National Measles Immunisation Campaign from 14 May [2017].The ministry has issued a warning to citizens and residents about the outbreak of the potentially fatal disease.HE Dr Ahmed bin Mohammed bin Obaid al Saeedi, Minister of Health, said, ""The ministry has detected an outbreak of measles in the sultanate. In 2016, the number of confirmed cases touched 114. From January till the end of April 2017, 44 cases have been registered.""HE Dr Saeedi said that the factors that have contributed to the outbreak include an increase in the number of expats from neighbouring countries and the frequent movement of people from countries which have experienced outbreaks of communicable diseases including measles.On the ministry's strategy, HE Dr Saeedi said that the sultanate is now considered to be in the elimination phase of measles and rubella.He said that many strategies and activities have been adopted including surveillance, outbreak investigation, and preventive measures throughout these years to control the disease. ""During the last few years, Oman reported a low incidence rate for measles which has reached almost zero local case per million population as per the World health Organization (WHO) indicators.""HE Dr Saeedi said that people between 20 and 35 years are more susceptible to the infection and play a role in transmitting it to the younger lot. The outbreak in Oman coincides with an increase in measles cases in a number of neighbouring countries, the Americas and Europe.Speaking to Muscat Daily, a senior official from MoH said, ""The ministry will implement the campaign for citizens and residents in the age group of 20-35 years. They will be administered MMR vaccine for protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. This is the same vaccine used to immunise children.""The ministry will run the campaign in 2 phases. In the 1st phase, the campaign will run from 14-20 May [2017] in Dhofar and Al Wusta. The 2nd phase will cover the rest of the country.The vaccination is free for all citizens and residents (born between 1982 and 1997) and will be available at government healthcare institutions and centres. The dates for the 2nd phase of vaccination will be announced later.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail moderator Eskild Petersenpromed@promedmail.org[Maps of Oman can be seen at <http://meteorites.wustl.edu/oman.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/124>. - Mod.LK]******[4] USA (Minnesota, Crow Wing County)Date: Wed 10 May 2017 9:13 AM CDTSource: Wadena Pioneer Journal [edited]<http://www.wadenapj.com/news/4264690-minnesota-measles-outbreak-spreads-northern-minnesota>The unvaccinated child in Crow Wing County with measles is a student at a local Catholic school, a letter to parents from the Minnesota Department of Health [MDH] said [Wed 10 May 2017].""This letter is to inform you that measles has been diagnosed in a child who attends St Francis of the Lakes Catholic School,"" the letter read. ""Your child may have been exposed to measles. Measles is a very contagious disease caused by a virus.""St Francis is a parochial school in Brainerd that teaches students in kindergarten through 8th grade. The health department reported [Thu 11 May 2017] a total of 41 confirmed cases since 11 Apr 2017 [see updated number of cases below, that is, 51 - Mod.LK]. The majority of cases are in Hennepin County, and almost all are unvaccinated.The child was not a Somali person, but did not provide further details in order to protect the child's identity. The outbreak has particularly affected unvaccinated children in the Somali community in the past few weeks, as 29 of the 34 confirmed cases so far are Somali and 32 are unvaccinated, according to MDH.State health officials have now expanded their recommendations for stepped-up vaccination in an effort to curb the spread of the disease.Measles is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and even death. It spreads very easily among unvaccinated people. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has made the following recommendations to protect children and adults during outbreaks: all children 12 months and older who have not received a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine should get the 1st dose as soon as possible and adults born in 1957 or later who have never received the MMR vaccine and have never had measles should get the vaccine as soon as possible.For children who have had one dose of the MMR vaccine, in counties where measles cases have been identified, children 12 months and older who received their 1st dose of the MMR vaccine at least 28 days ago should get their 2nd dose as soon as possible.Health care providers may recommend an early 2nd dose of the MMR vaccine during routine appointments for children statewide.Parents should contact their child's health care provider and specifically tell them the child needs the MMR vaccine. This may help avoid a longer wait associated with scheduling a routine appointment.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Minnesota can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354>.
