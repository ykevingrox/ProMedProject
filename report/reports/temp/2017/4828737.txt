PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update Yellow Fever [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=38040&lang=en>Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------In 2017, as of 8 Feb [2017], yellow fever cases have been confirmed in Brazil, whereas Colombia and Peru have only reported probable cases, one and 3 respectively.In Brazil, between 1 Dec 2016 and 8 Feb 2017, there were 1060 cases of yellow fever reported (215 confirmed, 80 discarded, and 765 suspected cases remain under investigation), including 166 deaths (70 confirmed, 3 discarded, and 93 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 33 percent among confirmed cases and 12 percent among suspected cases.According to the probable site of infection, the suspected and confirmed cases are distributed in 5 states: Bahia (9 cases), EspÌ rito Santo (109), Minas Gerais (847), SÌ£o Paulo (9), and Tocantins (1).The confirmed cases are distributed in 3 states: EspÌ rito Santo (20 cases), Minas Gerais (191), and SÌ£o Paulo (4) (Figure 1). Of the confirmed cases, 69 percent were men between 21 and 60 years of age (Figure 2).With regard to the confirmed deaths, 61 occurred in the state of Minas Gerais, 3 in the state of SÌ£o Paulo and 6 in the state of EspÌ rito Santo. In decreasing order, the CFR among suspected and confirmed cases by state is 33 percent in SÌ£o Paulo, 7 percent in Minas Gerais, and 6 percent in EspÌ rito Santo.In addition, 531 epizootics were reported in nonhuman primates (NHP), with a total of 1408 NHP deaths. To date, 298 of them were yellow fever confirmed.Epizootics in NHP were reported in the states of Alagoas, Bahia, GoiÌÁs, EspÌ rito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, ParÌÁ, ParanÌÁ, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Roraima, Santa Catarina, SÌ£o Paulo, Sergipe, Tocantins, and the Federal District (Figure 3).Although there have been no reports of yellow fever cases linked to the current outbreak in Brazil in other countries and/or territories in the Americas, reports of epizootics, currently under investigation, in states of Brazil bordering other countries--Roraima (bordering Venezuela), ParÌÁ (bordering Suriname and Guyana), Mato Grosso do Sul (bordering Bolivia and Paraguay), Santa Catarina (bordering Argentina), Rio Grande do Sul (bordering Uruguay and Argentina), and ParanÌÁ (bordering Argentina and Paraguay)--represent a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.In response to this situation, public health authorities at the federal, state and municipal levels are implementing various activities, including the distribution of 9.9 million vaccines to the states of Minas Gerais, EspÌ rito Santo, SÌ£o Paulo, Bahia, and Rio de Janeiro.While the possibility of a change in the yellow fever transmission cycle in this current outbreak remains, to date there is no evidence that _Aedes aegypti_ plays a role in the transmission.The Brazil situation report on the yellow fever outbreak is published daily and is available at: <http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/index.php/o-ministerio/principal/leia-mais-o-ministerio/619-secretaria-svs/l1-svs/27300-febre-amarela-informacao-e-orientacao>RecommendationsThe Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO / WHO), recommends Member States to continue efforts to detect, confirm, and appropriately treat cases of yellow fever in a timely manner and in a context of circulation of various arboviruses. Member States are encouraged to keep health care personnel up-to-date and trained to detect and treat cases especially in well-known areas of virus circulation.The most important yellow fever prevention measure is vaccination. Preventive vaccination can be carried out through systematic immunization in childhood or through unique mass campaigns to increase vaccination coverage in risk areas and also through vaccination of those traveling to at-risk areas.The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 percent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 percent immunity after 30 days. A single dose is sufficient to confer immunity and protection for life, without the need for booster doses. Severe side effects are extremely rare.Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines, it is recommended that national authorities conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in risk areas in order to focus the distribution of vaccines. In addition, it is recommended to keep a stock of vaccines at a national level to respond to possible outbreaks.PAHO/WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to countries with ongoing outbreaks of yellow fever.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp[The reported cases continue to be transmission from spill-over of sylvan (forest) yellow fever involving monkeys and forest mosquitoes (_Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ species). Interruption of this monkey-mosquito-monkey transmission cycle is not feasible. That makes vaccination of individuals who live in or visit the areas of cases imperative if human cases are to be prevented. There appears to be an adequate supply of vaccine for a campaign. The loss of over 1000 monkeys is worrisome. Some affected species are endemic to Brazil and in danger of extinction (see proMED-mail archive <www.promedmail.org/post/4825553>).The above report contains interesting graphs and map, and readers can access them at the above URL.Of interest is the US CDC issuance of a lever 2 alert as travel guidance given the yellow fever outbreak in Brazil. ""In response to this outbreak, health authorities have recently expanded the list of areas in which yellow fever vaccination is recommended for travelers. For a list of these municipalities and a map showing the existing and new yellow fever risk areas in Brazil, see the World Health Organization's most recent update.The alert continues, ""Anyone 9 months or older who travels to these areas should be vaccinated against yellow fever. People who have never been vaccinated against yellow fever should not travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks. CDC no longer recommends booster doses of yellow fever vaccine for most travelers. However, a booster dose may be given to travelers who received their last dose of yellow fever vaccine at least 10 years ago and who will be in a higher-risk setting, including areas with ongoing outbreaks. Because of the ongoing outbreak, travelers to the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and parts of Bahia, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro states may consider getting a booster if their last yellow fever vaccination was more than 10 years ago. Travelers should consult with a yellow fever vaccine provider to determine if they should be vaccinated. For more information on booster shots, see ""Clinician Information,"" (<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/yellow-fever-brazil>). ProMED readers who are planning to travel to these states are urged to read the entire alert. Remember, immunity is not effective until 10 days post-vaccination.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
