Wilmington News Journal, Associated Press (AP) [edited]<http://www.wnewsj.com/news/46075/clinton-county-health-district-11-human-cases-of-h3n2-flu-virus-confirmed>A total of 11 people who had known exposure to pigs at the recent Clinton County Fair have tested positive for a flu virus, but none of the cases have required hospitalization. Moreover, because of the period of onset to contract swine flu after exposure, the Clinton County health commissioner does not expect any more potential swine flu cases among humans who visited the Clinton County Fair's Hog Barn last week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017]. State of Ohio officials shut down the hog barn on [Thu 13 Jul 2017] after swine flu was detected in a pig [see Influenza, swine - USA: (OH) H3N2 20170717.5180499].On [Fri 14 Jul 2017], Clinton County Health Commissioner Pamela Walker Bauer reported there now are 11 lab-confirmed cases of the H3N2 flu virus in people. Lab testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still underway to see whether there is a connection to the specific variation of the swine flu [found at the fair], she said. A total of about 13 people were reported sick with flu-like illness to the Clinton County Health District, but 2 of them did not test positive for the H3N2 flu virus, according to Walker Bauer. Of the 11 lab-confirmed human cases of the H3N2 flu virus, the age range is from 7 months to 64 years old, reported Walker Bauer. The age bracket of 10 and younger has a higher level of incidence among the 11 cases compared to other age brackets, she said.Of those 11 patients, 8 are Clinton County residents, 2 are Warren Countians, and one lives in Highland County. By gender, 6 are males and 5 are females. All 11 patients reportedly are recovering, said the Clinton County health commissioner.Also [Fri 14 Jul 2017], state officials said nearly 50 hogs at another county fair in Ohio were removed for slaughter after at least 2 animals tested positive for swine flu, according to The Associated Press (AP). The Ohio Department of Agriculture says the hogs were removed from the Franklin County Fair on [Wed 19 Jul 2017] for slaughter. The Franklin County Agricultural Society said [Thu 20 Jul 2017] that livestock areas have been disinfected. State officials last week [week of 9-15 Jul 2017] ordered approximately 300 hogs slaughtered after the discovery of swine flu cases at the Clinton County Fair, added the AP.Agriculture Department spokesman Mark Bruce told The Columbus Dispatch the 2 incidents aren't related and involved different strains of influenza. He said viruses have an easier time infecting the animals when the weather is hot and humid [more likely due to the stress on the animals in the fair environment and the mixing of large numbers of animals from different farms - Mod.JH].[Byline: Gary Huffenberger]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Ohio can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/237>. A county map can be seen at <http://geology.com/county-map/ohio-county-map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ][A nice example of cross influenza virus infection between swine and people. - Mod.MHJ][The report above mentions that the influenza cases have been identified to be caused by A/H3N2 virus; it is not clear whether these are due to the swine variant of influenza A/H3N2 termed as A/H3N2v. However, as swine influenza was recently reported in pigs at the fair, the possibility of animal to human transmission is likely.The A/H3N2v viruses were first identified in US pigs in 2010 (<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-situation.htm>). Between 2011 and September 2016, 364 human H3N2v cases were reported from 14 states. The largest outbreak occurred in 2012 when a total of 309 human cases of H3N2v flu were identified, including 16 hospitalizations and one death (<http://nasphv.org/Documents/Influenza_Transmission_at_Swine_Exhibitions_2016.pdf>). The majority of cases were exhibitors and others in close contact with pigs at agricultural fairs.Symptoms of H3N2v infection in people are usually mild and similar to those of seasonal flu viruses, but as with seasonal flu, complications can lead to hospitalization and death. Clinical features may include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, as well as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The incubation period (the time it takes from exposure to onset of illness) for this influenza is also typically similar to seasonal influenza at about 2 days, but may be up to 10 days.There are ways to reduce the spread of influenza viruses between pigs and people (<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/swineflu/prevent-spread-flu-pigs-at-fairs.pdf>).CDC recommendations for people not at high risk include:- don't take food or drink into pig areas; don't eat, drink, or put anything in your mouth in pig areas;- don't take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items into pig areas. Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill;- take protective measures if you must come in contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes minimizing contact with pigs and wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves and masks that cover your mouth and nose when contact is required;- wash your hands often with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub;- to further reduce the risk of infection, minimize contact with pigs in the pig barn or arenas;- avoid contact with pigs if you have flu symptoms. Wait to have contact with pigs until 7 days after your illness started or until you have been without fever for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications, whichever is longer;- people with high risk factors who develop flu symptoms should call a health care provider;The same influenza antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can be used to treat variant virus infection.CDC recommendations for people with high risk factors include:- anyone who is at high risk of serious flu complications (<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm>) planning to attend a setting where pigs will be present should avoid pigs and swine barns;- people who are at high risk of serious flu complications include children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions (like asthma and other lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neuro-developmental conditions). - Mod.UBA][Since H3N2 viruses first appeared in pigs in 1998 there have been other documented swine-origin influenza A spillover cases in humans prior to the emergence of the A/H3N2v virus that contains the matrix protein from the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus. These other spillover events have typically been associated with swine farm workers, county fairs, etc. (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16836834&dopt=Abstract> and <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/12/06-1323_article>). Due to the significant biosecurity risks posed by county fairs, most people working in the US swine industry do not participate in such events. Given the near annual occurrence of human agricultural fair-acquired influenza cases, one wonders whether the risks of showing any influenza-susceptible animals at such events are truly worth the rewards, for the animals or the humans. - Mod.JH]
