Diagnosis and management of _Borrelia turicatae_ infection in febrile soldier, Texas, USA. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5): 883-4. doi:10.3201/eid2305.162069.------------------------------------------------------------------Tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF) was first reported in the USA more than 100 years ago but is often difficult to identify, given its rarity and variety of clinical presentations (1,2). We describe a case of culture-confirmed TBRF caused by _Borrelia turicatae_ acquired by a soldier during a military training exercise in Texas, USA.The patient was a 31 year old white man with no relevant medical history. In August 2015, he sought care at the Eglin Air Force Base Hospital (Valparaiso, Florida, USA) with a 5 day history of fever (102 F[38.9 C]), chills, and myalgia. He reported headache and nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea. He denied localized joint pain, redness, or swelling but had discomfort in both popliteal fossae. The patient had recently returned to Florida after a 30 day army exercise under austere conditions in western Texas (figure 1 [for figures, see source URL. - Mod.LL]). Potential exposures included sleeping nude in a sleeping bag on the floor of an abandoned barn that had been cleared of infestation with rabbits, rodents, birds, and bats; having eaten boar that had been slaughtered, dressed, and cooked over an open flame; and consuming water procured from a well, bottled sources, and at times through a LifeStraw (<http://lifestraw.com/>). Approximately one week before admission, he had noted multiple skin lesions, including scattered, presumed insect bites along his left leg and a small lesion at his urethral meatus. He denied any history of genital lesions and had not seen any biting insects. After 6 days, the lesions spontaneously resolved.In a Texas emergency department, the initial diagnosis was viral syndrome, and a rapid influenza test result was negative. The fever persisted despite administration of antipyretics. After 2 days, the patient returned to the hospital, where he received only symptomatic treatment. No tests were ordered. After another 2 days, he sought care from his unit physician. Laboratory tests showed marked thrombocytopenia with 16 000 platelets/mL (reference range 150 000-400 000 platelets/mL). Spirochetes were seen on peripheral blood smear (figure 2). He was referred for hospital admission. Physical examination findings were unremarkable: no splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or rash. Blood cultures and serologic testing for rickettsiae, HIV, dengue virus, _Treponema pallidum_, and plasmodia produced negative results. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (58 mm/h) and C-reactive protein level (more than 19 mg/L) were elevated. Electrolytes and transaminase levels were within reference ranges.Serum samples collected at admission and 3 weeks later (about 5 and 26 days after illness onset, S1 and S2, respectively) were tested in parallel at the CDC, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (Fort Collins, CO, USA) by enzyme immunoassay and Western blot (IgM and IgG) for TBRF antibody reactivity. Seroconversion was demonstrated by rising enzyme immunoassay values (S1 = 0.79, S2 = 2.41; equivocal range 0.64-0.91) and separate IgM and IgG Western blots (figure 3). In addition, the samples demonstrated seroconversion (S1 = 0.91, S2 = 3.23; equivocal range 0.90-1.09) against C6, an immunogenic antigen conserved among _Borrelia_ spp. (_Borrelia burgdorferi- ELISA; Immunetics, Inc, Boston, MA, USA).Spirochetes were successfully cultured, and genomic sequencing determined that _B. turicatae_ was the causative agent (3). The patient improved rapidly with doxycycline, and platelet count normalized within 2 weeks. 10 asymptomatic soldiers with similar exposure were identified and prophylactically given doxycycline; 24 asymptomatic soldiers who had been in the area but not in the same barn as the patient were monitored closely. No additional illnesses were detected.TBRF is a neglected and probably underdiagnosed disease. The vector, the _Ornithodoros turicata_ tick, is endemic to Texas and Florida (4); but although published cases in Texas have been supported by serology for the TBRF group, exposure location, and tick collections (4,5), to the best of our knowledge, successful identification of _B. turicatae_ in a human has not been reported. Previously, _B. turicatae_ has been isolated only from ticks and canids in several areas of Texas (4-6).The ecologic setting of the military exercises was predictable for high-risk exposure to the tick vector. TBRF attack rates greater than 22 per cent have been reported for group settings with sequelae severe enough to warrant hospitalization (7,8). Military training groups in Israel have declared certain caves off limits because of heavy tick presence (9) and have prophylactically administered doxycycline to those suspected to have been exposed (7). There has not been an association of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction in asymptomatic patients receiving doxycycline (7), although this reaction is common during treatment of patients with active illness (9).We identified several difficulties in epidemiologic awareness and diagnosis. There is overlap of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens in location and nonspecific symptom presentations. The _O. turicata_ tick bite is rarely noticed or reported because the vectors are rapid nocturnal feeders, attachment is painless, and often no lesions or ticks are discovered (10). This case report with successful isolation and genetic characterization of _B. turicatae_ from the soldier (3) confirms that this spirochete species is a zoonotic pathogen. The initial misdiagnosis further indicates the neglected nature of this disease, especially in the military population.References----------1. Meader CN.

Tickborne relapsing fever -- United States, 1990-2011. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2015; 64(3): 58-60 (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6403a3.htm?s_cid=mm6403a3_w>) regarding the distribution of tickborne borreliosis in the USA:""TBRF is not nationally reportable, and there is no standard case definition. For the purpose of this report, a TBRF case was defined as a clinically compatible illness with laboratory confirmation of infection or a clinically compatible illness epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. In 2011, TBRF was reportable in 12 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington. TBRF case data for these 12 states for the period 1990-2011 were compiled, along with a single case reported to CDC from Wyoming, yielding 504 cases. 3 states accounted for approximately 70 per cent of all reported TBRF cases (California, 33 per cent, Washington, 25 per cent, and Colorado, 11 per cent); the remainder were reported from Idaho, 7 per cent, Nevada, 5 per cent, Oregon, 4 per cent, Arizona, 4 per cent, Texas, 4 per cent, New Mexico, 3 per cent, Montana, 2 per cent, Utah, 2 per cent, and Wyoming, less than 1 per cent. No cases were reported from North Dakota. County of residence and county of exposure were known for 325 (64 per cent) of cases; 215 (66 per cent) of these cases were reported among nonresident visitors to the counties of exposure.""The case also is a reminder that louse-borne relapsing fever has been recognized in recent years in the EU as a result of the immigration of displaced Africans (example: Lucchini A, Lipani F, Costa C, et al: Louse-borne relapsing fever among East African refugees, Italy, 2015. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016; 22(2); 298-301; doi: 10.3201/eid2202.151768).It should be noted that in this report, local transmission of the disease was suspected. Cases have also been reported in asylum seekers in Germany and the Netherlands. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
