They don't fuss when vector ecologist Tanya Posey pulls opens the door of a coop in a community garden here, firmly grasps a Leghorn, and pulls a blood sample out of its wing vein. She's so good, she can bleed a chicken in about 30 seconds. That's helpful, because she has a lot of chickens to test.More than 6 dozen sentinel chickens, living in coops dotted around Los Angeles, make up one of the 1st lines of defense in this sprawling county's fight against West Nile virus. The disease has been a background threat for years here, but cases have spiked this fall to worrisome levels. In Los Angeles county there have been 6 deaths reported by Los Angeles County this year [2017] -- including 3 just last week [week of Sun 17 Sep 2017].And the cases are alarmingly severe: Of 98 reported infections here this year [2017], 79 have led to serious neurological side effects, and 87 have required hospitalization. Because it's still peak mosquito season, more deaths are expected.So local public health officials this week launched an all-out attack. They're sending teams of green-shirted vector control agents door to door to tell residents to wear bug spray, install window screens, and dump the stagnant water where the insects breed. They're plastering the county with posters that read ""It's Not Just a Bite"" and ""No Es Solo Un Piquete."" They've even created a rap video featuring a fetid swimming pool, a giant dancing mosquito, and teams of uniformed agents rapping, ""You've got to dump the water out, drain the water flow, tip the water out, toss the water slow.""[Byline: Usha Lee McFarling]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[There have been several equine cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infections in California so far this year [2017]. An earlier ProMED-mail post this year indicated that for 2017, a total of 7 horses have been confirmed positive for WNV infections. The California Department of Food and Agriculture reported that the positive horses were located in Glenn, Contra Costa, Fresno, Kern (2 cases), Riverside, and San Joaquin counties. Now there are several human cases in Los Angeles county, including 3 just in the previous week [week of Sun 17 Sep 2017]. The proactive efforts of public health officials to educate the public to avoid mosquito bites and reduce mosquito breeding sites should be helpful in preventing additional cases.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map showing the location of California can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1580> and a map showing the location of Los Angeles county at <http://geology.com/county-map/california-county-map.gif>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.]
