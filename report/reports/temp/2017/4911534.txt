The animal attacked 2 people, who were then put under observation and received the appropriate immunization. It was in contact with another cat and a horse, which did not present clinical signs or teeth marks during the check-up and the follow-up; they remained under observation for 15 days.EpidemiologySource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusiveEpidemiological comments: The rabies case was notified by the Ministry of health (MINSAL) to the Epidemiological surveillance section of the Veterinary services of the Ministry of agriculture and livestock, after the MINSAL Reference national laboratory diagnosed it positive. According to the Reference World Laboratory of the Health Secretary of State, the Pasteur Institute, the linage of the virus is genetically compatible with that of the virus isolated in an insectivorous bat, _Tadarida brasiliensis_. Nevertheless, the direct source of infection remains unknown. A screening in all susceptible species was performed within a 5-km radius around the outbreak to identify animals bitten by a bat. Activities were coordinated with municipal representatives and staff from the MINSALControl measuresMeasures applied: quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; no treatment of affected animals;Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / DetailsCabanas / Cats / 943 / Total of vaccinated animals: 3143 (943 cats and 2200 dogs)Measures to be applied: No other measuresDiagnosis test resultsLaboratory name and type / Species / Test date / ResultPasteur Institute (Foreign laboratory) / Cats / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 18 Oct 2016 / PositiveFuture reportingThe event is resolved.

When a person is exposed to an animal suspected of having rabies, the risk of rabies virus transmission should be evaluated carefully. Risk assessment should include consideration of the species of animal involved, the prevalence of rabies in the area, whether exposure sufficient to transmit rabies virus occurred, and the current status of the animal and its availability for diagnostic testing. Wild carnivores and bats present a considerable risk where the disease is found, regardless of whether abnormal behavior has been observed. Insectivorous bats, though small, can inflict wounds with their teeth and should never be caught or handled with bare hands. Bat bites may be ignored or go unnoticed, so direct contact with bats could be considered a risk of virus exposure.Any wild carnivore or bat suspected of exposing a person to rabies should be considered rabid unless proved otherwise by laboratory diagnosis; ideally, this includes bats in direct contact with people, such as those found in rooms with sleeping or otherwise unaware persons. Wildlife, including wolf hybrids, should never be kept as pets; if one of those animals exposes a person or domestic animal, the wild animal should be managed like free-ranging wildlife.""
