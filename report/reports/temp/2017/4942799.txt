The UK was the 1st to report an increase in the number of cases, and today there are about 13 countries reporting this increase, including Portugal. To give you a sense of the scale, last year [2016], we had at this time 6 cases reported, and now we have 100,"" explained Agency Lusa of the National Program for Viral Hepatitis of the Directorate General of Health (DGS).Almost all cases are being reported in Greater Lisbon, and, according to Isabel Aldir, the situation of this ""epidemic activity seems to be very often associated with sexual transmission through certain practices, especially among men, which causes an increased risk of transmission of the disease. This can happen to any individual with any sexual orientation, but what has been so far described is, in fact, a predominance of cases in men, not exclusively, but comparatively much more often in males, and within men, men who have sex with men seem to be more affected,"" said the head of the DGS. The main form of contagion is through the fecal-oral route.Isabel Aldir argues that information and knowledge about what actions to take to reduce the risk of contagion are the most efficient ways to combat the spread of the disease, and leaves some examples of postures to adopt. ""Practicing personal and domestic hygiene, proper washing of the hands when preparing meals or going to the bathroom are also the most efficient measures. Regarding sexual transmission, it is in fact in their sexual life that each individual must take measures to reduce risk,"" said the director of the national program for viral hepatitis.--Communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed@promedmail.org>[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al: Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at <http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract>), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A was reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from ACIP are:Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:- men who have sex with men;- people who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs;- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/42>.]
