The Riverine Herald [edited]<http://www.riverineherald.com.au/2017/02/13/5933/ross-river-virus-cases-skyrocke>FF went from being fit and strong to almost being in a wheelchair in just a week. All thanks to a mosquito. The Bunnaloo farmer and author was one of 34 people diagnosed with Ross River virus in the Murrumbidgee Local Health District in December [2016] -- 5 times the average for that time of year.And Victoria is experiencing the worst outbreak of Ross River virus seen in at least a decade. In Campaspe Shire, there have been a staggering 43 notifications of the virus since [1 Jan 2017], according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That is one person a day.FF contracted the virus about 8 weeks ago after being bitten by a mosquito. As well as raising 3 school-aged children and running a rice farm, the busy mother is in the middle of editing her 3rd book. This has been made even more difficult because of the effects of the virus, including polyarthritis and severe fatigue. ""It has been very debilitating,"" she said. ""I had 6 weeks off work and started back last week but the fatigue is making it very difficult. I'm editing my next release, but I am yet to see if I will make my deadline.""Once FF was diagnosed, she started taking medication to help control the symptoms. ""Thankfully it has helped,"" she said. ""I'm starting to have days where I feel less fatigued.""Over the border in Victoria, 654 cases were diagnosed last month [January 2017] alone -- more than 20 times higher than the last outbreak in 2011. The average number of Ross River virus cases each year is 252. Heavy rainfall last year [2016] has created ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes, resulting in increasing reports of mosquito-borne illness.Campaspe Shire has increased its mosquito monitoring program, following the increase in funding received last month [January 2017]. Victoria's chief health officer Professor Charles Guest is warning people to take extra care to protect themselves against Ross River, Barmah Forest virus and the potentially life-threatening Murray Valley encephalitis virus.""The number of Ross River virus notifications being made to the department this year-to-date is the largest that Victoria has seen compared to equivalent periods in the preceding 10 years,"" he said. ""Given the unprecedented number of notifications ... we expect that the magnitude of this year's outbreak will be larger than the outbreak observed in 2011. All parts of Victoria where there are mosquitoes may carry a risk for Ross River virus infection, although the risk is greatest in rural and regional Victoria.""People bitten by an infected mosquito may experience joint swelling and pain, fatigue and muscle aches.Echuca-Moama Family Medical Practice GP Sue Harrison said the clinic had a few positive results, more than the past few years. Dr Harrison said about 30 per cent of people infected with Ross River virus would develop symptoms 3 to 11 days after being infected, with others developing symptoms up to 21 days after exposure. ""Once you've got it, like many of these viral things, you just have to rest and treat symptomatically,"" she said.She advised people to take precautions against mosquito bites. ""When in mosquito-prone areas, wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing and use insect repellent to help reduce the chance of being bitten by mosquitoes,"" she said.[Byline: Ivy Wise]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Ross River virus (RRV) infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy, including in New South Wales and Victoria states. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, than can persist for weeks making normal movement difficult.Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.A map of the states of New South Sout Wales and Victoria, Australia can be seen at <http://www.healthmap.org/promed/?p=288>. - Mod.TY]
