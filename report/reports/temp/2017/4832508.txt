La Razon [in Spanish, translation. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.la-razon.com/sociedad/caranavi-fiebre_amarilla-caso_0_2653534635.html>The ministry of Health confirmed the 1st case of yellow fever in Bolivia after 10 years of not having been reported. The affected individual is a Danish citizen who was traveling in Caranavi and was positive in tests that were carried out.""After 10 years, a case of yellow fever is confirmed. The affected individual is a foreigner who went into the forest (in Caranavi) and apparently that is where he acquired the virus. A team of technicians of the Ministry went there to strengthen surveillance and control (in the area),"" said the National Health Director, Rodolfo Rocabado.The infected man arrived in the region a month ago [January 2017] and presented with symptoms of the disease for which Caranavi Hospital personnel sent samples to the laboratory in the Center for Tropical Diseases (CENETROP) in Santa Cruz city. The results corroborated the clinical picture, La Raz√å n stated in its print version.Dr Pamela Rojas, Director of the hospital in Caranavi, stated that a health emergency was declared for the area. Meanwhile, the ill man was released from the hospital and sent to Chile to receive treatment. There are no suspected cases, she added.""Given the confirmation, a health emergency declaration was issued and all personnel are currently involved in active surveillance. We think that no suspected cases of the disease have been reported. The European citizen was given a medical discharge from the hospital and went to Chile for follow up with an indication that he recuperated,"" Rojas informed this population on television.This [Fri 10 Feb 2017] a group of professional entomologists, biochemists and other specialists will go to Caranavi to proceed with pertinent investigations to the initiation of a vaccination campaign.A month ago [January 2017] surveillance was initiated in the country due to cases reported in Brazil, Colombia and Peru.[Byline: Rodolfo Aliaga]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is odd that the Ministry of Health indicated that this case is the 1st one in Bolivia in 10 years. There was one case in 2013 in Cochabamba department and another one in 2012 in Beni department. The occurrence of a case in the tropical area of La Paz department is not surprising. Yellow fever virus is endemic in the Amazon Basin of the South American tropics. This is undoubtedly a case of sylvan (jungle) yellow fever, where the virus infects wild primates and is transmitted to people by forest mosquitoes. It is critical that individuals in these areas be vaccinated against yellow fever virus infections, to not only protect themselves, but to prevent introduction of the virus into the urban cycle where significant numbers of cases, with a high (30 percent) case fatality may occur, as happened in Paraguay in 2008. It is good that the local health authorities are responding to the occurrence of this case.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Bolivia can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5>.]
