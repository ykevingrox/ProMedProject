XinHuaNet [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/01/c_136410041.htm>The WHO said here on [Sat 1 Jul 2017] that a cholera outbreak in war-torn Yemen has killed 1500 people since late April 2017. The suspected cases have reached 246 000 as the epidemic has hit 21 out of the 23 provinces in the country, Dr Nevio Zagaria, the chief of WHO, said in a press conference.Meanwhile, Sherin Varkey, acting representative of the United nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), said during the joint press conference that one in 4 of the dead are children.The death toll has increased by 100 and suspected cases by nearly 28 000 in just 4 days after a Wednesday's report by WHO, where it put the death toll at 1400 and suspected cases at 218 798. Since 27 April 2017, the cholera cases in Yemen have been ""increasing at an average of 5000 a day,"" said WHO. ""We are now facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world.""More than 3 years into war, Yemen is facing a total collapse, where 2 3rds of the total population, around 19 million, need humanitarian aid. About 10.3 million people are at risk of famine and 14.5 million lack access to safe drinking water. Fewer than 45 percent of the country's hospitals are operational, but even the operational ones are coping with huge challenges, especially the lack of medications, medical equipment and staff. The blockade on Yemen, as part of a Saudi-led bombing campaign launched in March 2015, has deepened the crisis in the country which used to import most of its basic needs. The war has pit the Iranian-allied Shiite Houthi rebel movement against a Sunni Saudi-led military coalition, after Houthis toppled Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government in late 2014.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the dreadfully impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 53202 Jun / 73 700 / 60504 Jun / 86 400 / 67605 Jun / 91 400 / 72806 Jun / 96 000 / 74607 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 1500To be consistent with past posts, the date is the day prior to the specific posting but, as this one, may not reflect the data point day.
