PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update Yellow Fever [edited]<http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=40841&lang=en>Situation summary in the Americas-------------------------From epidemiological week (EW) 1 to EW 26 of 2017, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.The following is an update on the situation in Brazil, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. No changes in the number of reported cases have been reported in the other countries.In Brazil, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016 up to 31 May 2017, there were 3240 suspected cases of yellow fever reported (792 confirmed, 1929 discarded, and 519 under investigation), including 435 deaths (274 confirmed, 124 discarded, and 37 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) among confirmed cases is 35 percent.According to the probable site of infection, suspected cases correspond to 407 municipalities, while the confirmed cases were distributed among 130 municipalities in 8 states (EspÌ rito Santo, GoiÌÁs, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, ParÌÁ, Rio de Janeiro, SÌ£o Paulo, and Tocantins) and the Federal District.With regard to the confirmed fatal cases and their probable site of infection, one corresponds to the Federal District, 85 to EspÌ rito Santo, one to GoiÌÁs, one to Matto Grosso, 165 to Minas Gerais, 4 to ParÌÁ, 7 to Rio de Janeiro, and 10 to SÌ£o Paulo. In the states with more than 5 confirmed deaths, the CFR among confirmed cases is 50 percent in SÌ£o Paulo, 41 percent in Rio de Janeiro, 34 percent in Minas Gerais, and 33 percent in EspÌ rito Santo.No cases were confirmed in new municipalities in EspÌ rito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), SÌ£o Paulo (SP), and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) in the last month. The dates of symptoms onset of the most recently confirmed cases are 18 Apr 2017 (MG), 19 Apr (SP), 29 Apr (ES), and 10 May (RJ).The state of ParÌÁ reported 4 confirmed cases in EW 13 of 2017, and the state of Tocantins reported a confirmed case in EW 16 of 2017. In addition, a case was confirmed in the state of GoiÌÁs and another case in the state of Mato Grosso, in an area known to be at risk for yellow fever.Although no confirmed cases have been reported to date in the state of Bahia, since the beginning of the year up to 8 May 2017, a total of 255 epizootics [cases in non-human primates] were reported in 78 municipalities; 54 of these epizootics were positive for yellow fever by RT-PCR in 28 municipalities, and 4 were in neighborhoods of Salvador city, capital of the Bahia state.To date, the _Aedes aegypti_ vector has not been reported to have a role in transmission. However, confirmed epizootics in large cities, such as Vitoria in EspÌ rito Santo and Salvador in Bahia, represent a high risk for a change in the transmission cycle.Figure 1 [graph] shows the trend in the number of reported cases in Brazil, according to their current classification (confirmed, discarded, under investigation).Figure 1 [graph]. Distribution of reported yellow fever cases by date of symptoms onset and probable state of infection. Brazil, 1 Dec 2016 to 31 May 2017.Since the beginning of the outbreak up to 31 May 2017, a total of 3850 epizootics in nonhuman primates (NHP) were reported, of which 642 were confirmed for yellow fever, 96 were discarded, and 1448 remain under investigation. Between the publication of yellow fever bulletins # 41 and 43 by the Brazil Ministry of Health, the number of epizootics increased by 190.Epizootics in NHP were reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Amazonas, Bahia, GoiÌÁs, EspÌ rito Santo, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, ParÌÁ, ParaÌ ba, ParanÌÁ, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, RondÌ«nia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, SÌ£o Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins.Reports of epizootics currently under investigation in states bordering Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela represent a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.With regard to the outbreak response implemented by the Brazil Ministry of Health, between January and May 2017, a total of 26.3 million doses of yellow fever vaccine were distributed to intensify the selective vaccination strategy in 1050 municipalities of the states of Bahia, EspÌ rito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and SÌ£o Paulo. As of 31 May 2017, administrative coverage equal to or greater than 95 percent was reached in 192 municipalities; coverage between 75 and 94.9 percent was reached in 381 municipalities; and, coverage of less than 75 percent was reached in 477 municipalities (126 of these municipalities have coverage lower than 50 percent).In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, a new case of yellow fever was confirmed in EW 25 of 2017, raising the total number of cases confirmed in 2017 to 2. The new case was probably infected in the municipality of Villa Tunari, Cochabamba Department. In this department, there had been no cases since 2013. The probable site of infection of the previous case was the municipality of Caranavi, La Paz Department. In both departments, infection sites correspond to known areas at risk for yellow fever.In Ecuador, 3 confirmed cases of yellow fever were reported: one in EW 8, another in EW 20, and a 3rd case in EW 26 of 2017. All 3 fatal cases were adult males, with no vaccination history who acquired the infection in the province of SucumbÌ os.In Peru, as of EW 24 of 2017, a total of 20 confirmed and probable cases of yellow fever were reported, including 3 deaths. Similar to 2016, most cases occurred in the JunÌ n department.RecommendationsAlthough no new confirmed cases have been reported in Brazil since May 2017, countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru have reported sporadic cases in known areas at risk for yellow fever, indicating that the virus continues to circulate [in the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission], and there is a risk of transmission in non-immunized populations. Therefore, the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges Member States to continue efforts to detect, confirm, and adequately and timely treat cases of yellow fever. To this end, health care workers should be kept up to date and trained to detect and treat cases, especially in areas of known virus circulation. PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated when heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.VaccinationThe yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 percent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 percent immunity after 30 days. A single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed.Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines and with the aim of promoting the rational use, PAHO/WHO reiterates its recommendations to national authorities:1) Conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in areas at risk at the municipal level to guarantee at least 95 percent coverage among the resident population of these areas.2) Member States that are not currently experiencing outbreaks should not conduct immunization campaigns. Priority should be given to the use of vaccines in susceptible populations and to avoid revaccination.3) Ensure vaccination of all travelers to endemic areas at least 10 days before traveling.4) Depending on vaccine availabilities, Member States should have a small stock that allows them to respond to outbreaks.5) Postpone routine vaccination in children in non-endemic areas until sufficient vaccines are available. Once there is availability, catch-up campaigns should be conducted to complete vaccination schedules.PrecautionsIt is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease when faced with the risk of an adverse event occurring in persons over 60 years who have not been previously vaccinated.- The vaccine can be offered to individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ counts 200 cells/mm3 or higher requiring vaccination.- Pregnant women should be vaccinated in an emergency situation and following recommendations of health authorities.- Vaccination is recommended in lactating women who live in endemic areas, since the risk of transmitting the vaccine virus to the child is lower than the benefits of the vaccination of breastfeeding women.- For pregnant or lactating women traveling to areas with yellow fever transmission, vaccination is recommended when travel cannot be postponed or avoided. They should receive advice on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination to make an informed decision. The benefits of breastfeeding are superior to those of other nutritional alternatives.The following people are usually excluded from yellow fever vaccination:- Immunocompromised individuals (including those with thymus disorders, symptomatic HIV, malignant neoplasms under treatment, and those that are receiving or have received immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments, recent transplants, and current or recent radiation therapy).- People with severe allergies to eggs and their derivatives.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp[Fortunately, the outbreak in Brazil appears to be declining, and still no instances have been documented of _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission. That risk will continue in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru so long as the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is occurring. Persistence of yellow fever virus in endemic sylvan (forest) cycles of transmission in Brazil and neighboring countries is reason enough to maintain a high proportion of the population -- at least 80 per cent -- vaccinated in areas of risk. The above report indicates that the availability of the vaccine is limited at this time. This doubtless is temporary, and when stocks are improved, one hopes that efforts to provide vaccine coverage over broad areas of YF virus endemicity can continue to avoid the lapses in coverage the led to this outbreak.Individuals planning on traveling to the affected areas in Brazil, or other countries where YF is endemic should seek vaccination as soon as possible because there is a predicted vaccine shortage starting in mid to late summer this year (2017) in the USA.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.
