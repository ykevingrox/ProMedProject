East African Community (EAC) Secretariat Press release [summarised, edited]<http://www.eac.int/news-and-media/press-releases/20170927/eac-secretariat-joins-campaign-eliminate-dog-mediated-rabies-2030>Some 1500 people die annually from rabies in the United Republic of Tanzania alone, according to scientific estimates. Official numbers are lower, because many cases are not reported and not all reported cases appear in the official statistics. Most rabies victims are children and dog bites are the main path of transmission.Rabies is an infectious disease of public health concern for the entire East African region and beyond. Against this backdrop, the EAC Secretariat supports the World Rabies Day, which takes place on [Thu 28 Sep 2017], through the 'Support to Pandemic Preparedness in the EAC Region' project that is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√å r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.Rabies is the most fatal virus zoonosis (disease that can be transmitted between animals and humans) known to mankind. Once an infected person shows signs, there is no cure to rabies. In Africa and Asia, many humans get infected by rabies through dog bites. The World Health Organization (WHO) underscores the importance of dog vaccination as the most effective intervention against rabies, decreasing rabies in dogs and having a direct impact on public health by reducing transmission to humans.Supported by the EAC Secretariat, WHO and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) among others, Mbwa Wa Africa Animal Rescue will vaccinate an estimated 5000 dogs across 20 vaccination stations in Arusha City on World Rabies Day. In addition, Mbwa Wa Africa raises awareness in about 70 schools in Arusha on how to safely approach dogs and on how to read possible signs of rabies infection and to distinguish infected from healthy dogs. Weekly rabies awareness articles will be published in both English and Swahili newspapers.The activities are planned in collaboration with the Arusha City Council in liaison with the Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and the Ministry of Health.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>The locations of the 20 rabies vaccination centers scheduled to carry out the vaccination of dogs in Tanzania during 30 September and 01 October 2017 is available at the URL of the source. - Mod.AS******[2] Angola, humanDate: Thu 28 Sep 2017From: Neida Ramos <neydaneto@gmail.com> [Portuguese, transl Mod.RNA, summarised, edited]A total of 11 people died in the province of Cuanza Norte during the 1st half of this year [2017], victims of rabies, after having been attacked by infected dogs. This means 10 more [than the number of rabies cases] during the same [period during] 2016, informed the supervisor of the epidemiological surveillance area in the Provincial Health Department, Kende Alfredo.On [Thu 28 Sep 2017], World Rabies Day, the official said that the reported cases occurred among a total of 768 people bitten by dogs, cats and monkeys in the province.He made it known that the Cazengo municipality (the county capital of the province) leads the statistics with 8 deaths related to rabies among 370 cases of dog bites.Compared to the same period of 2016, Kende Alfredo said that there was an increase of 431 cases of animal bites, justifying this increase with the high number of stray dogs that circulate in the streets of different localities of the province.--Neida Ramos, MD, Ministry of Health, Angola<neydaneto@gmail.com>The above report was originally submitted by Dr Neida Ramos to ProMED-PORT (in Portuguese). The moderator, RNA, acknowledged the sender and included, in the commentary, request for additional information on canine rabies control strategies in Angola as well as on the prevailing and applied pre-and post-exposure prevention strategies for humans. He asked if the reported cases received any kind of post-exposure care, including serovaccination and if the post-exposure treatment was complete and timely.According to the most recent available annual report of Angola to the OIE, the number of dogs vaccinated against rabies during 2015 was 429 165; 85 cases of rabies in (dead) dogs were reported.The number of officially reported human cases, countrywide, during recent years was:2013 - 111; 2014 - 91; 2015 - 69. The data for 2016 are not yet available. - Mod.AS******[3] South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal, canineDate: Wed 20 Sep 2017Source: North Coast Courier [edited]<http://northcoastcourier.co.za/93958/hunt-salt-rock-holidaymaker-possibly-exposed-rabies/>Over the past month  cases of rabies have been reported in the King Cetshwayo District (Eshowe to Richards Bay), moving south through the Ilembe District(Ndwedwe and Maphumulo) into Inanda township in Durban - and now in the greater Ballito area.Most recently Sables Creatures volunteer, Dee Allan picked up an aggressive stray puppy running from Salt Rock to Ballito on Ocean Drive on [Thu 14 Sep 2017]last week and took it to Aloe Veterinary Clinic in Ballito.It was put to sleep and yesterday [Tue 19 Sep 2017] the results from the post mortem revealed that it tested positive for rabies.Salt Rock Veterinary Clinic's Dr Janet Hulbert said a white, female holidaymaker reported at their clinic after being bitten by a dog on [Thu 14 Sep 2017] last week.""We now have reason to be very concerned that the same dog that bit her was the one that was euthanased at another local veterinary clinic the same day,and has been confirmed as rabid on post mortem.She said it was urgent that the holidaymaker was found immediately.""If you are bitten by any animal, it is important to immediately wash the wound with hot water and soap for 15 minutes and go to a doctor straight away.""Aloe Veterinary Clinic's Dr Jeremy Lamb said it was crucial that the public did not touch strays.""Any animal can get rabies if they are not vaccinated and are bitten by a rabid animal,"" said Dr Lamb, who has never before seen a rabies case in hisclinic.He said rabies is a viral disease, affecting the central nervous system. It is spread through contact with the saliva of infected animals, through bitesor any break in the skin.""Make sure your pets' annual vaccinations are all up to date.""Vaccination will provide your pet with much greater resistance to rabies if he is exposed to the disease, but you must be aware that there is no cure once it occurs.""He said the only way to confirm if a dog has rabies is by putting the dog to sleep and examining the brain to test for rabies.""If you have been bitten by an animal, go to the hospital straight away to get treatment. There is no point in taking the risk.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>The above report from South Africa should serve as reminder of the crucial piece of information: never pick up a stray puppy, including the ones which look sad and needy. Dogs can get infected from their earliest age if their mothers were not vaccinated, threatening the life of contacts. Puppies have been found notoriously a common source of human infection, in particular of children. - Mod.AS******[4] South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal, humanDate: Tue 19 Sep 2017Source: Northern Natal Courier [edited]<http://northernnatalcourier.co.za/74296/death-baby-sparks-massive-anti-rabies-drive/>The death of a 2-year-old from rabies in north-east KZN has prompted the KZN Veterinary Services to step-up the fight against the disease.KZN Veterinary staff have reduced animal rabies by 90 percent in the province over a period of time since 2007 (473 cases down to 47).Spokesman Khaye Nkwanyana said the shock death of the baby had 'strengthened our resolve to fight and combat it so that no additional life must be lost through rabies.'""Until recently, the province has been human rabies free, working in partnership with World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation conducted mass dog vaccination programmes that broke the disease across the province, and established KZN as the Africa leader in rabies control.""""The Province is now on a massive drive to eliminate rabies completely in order to prevent more human deaths. What we are targeting is the vaccinationof more than 70 percent of the dogs in these Districts as they remain the main source of the disease for the rest of province. We have taken a decision toset aside a budget for the next 6-month intensification of the vaccination programme, especially in rural areas working with local authorities.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
