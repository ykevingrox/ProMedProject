The News Nigeria [edited]<http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2017/09/kebbi-govt-confirms-656-cases-of-measles/>The Kebbi government on Friday [22 Sep 2017] said it had recorded 656 suspected cases of measles in 21 local government areas of the state.The Executive Secretary, State Primary Health Care and Development Agency, Dr Mannir Jega, who described the figure as alarming, said it was largely due to refusal of residents to go for routine immunisation.The executive secretary said at a news briefing in Birnin Kebbi, that the state had recorded poor coverage due to low turnout for routine immunizations in previous campaigns in 2016.""We have 656 measles cases in the 21 LGAs in the state, out of which 77 cases had been confirmed in 12 LGAs, and the victims were treated and discharged,"" he said.The Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Usman Kambaza, revealed that 1131 vaccination teams would be deployed to undertake immunisation to counter the upsurge of measles cases across the state.""To counter this, the state is planning a measles campaign with the support of the National Primary Health Care and Development Agency and other partners. The campaign is expected to start on 26 Sep 2017, and about 898 174 children are expected to be vaccinated. The vaccination is for all children from 9 months-5 years irrespective of vaccination status,"" he said.Kambaza explained that vaccinators would be stationed at specific locations close to residences in all the 225 wards in the state, adding that ""no caregiver will travel more than one km to get their children vaccinated.""The commissioner urged the media, traditional and religious leaders, and other stakeholders to join in mobilizing women and caregivers to come out in mass for the measles immunisation.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Nigeria can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>.]******[2] Greece vaccination appealDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017Source: WRAL.com [edited]<http://www.wral.com/greece-makes-measles-vaccination-appeal-amid-european-spike/16965727/>Health authorities in Greece have issued a public appeal to participate in vaccination and booster shot programs following a spike in measles cases in the country amid an outbreak in Europe.The Greek Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Fri [22 Sep 2017] that 166 cases had been reported in the country in 2016-17, with an increase in recent days.More than 17 000 measles cases have been reported in that period in 30 European countries monitored by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, resulting in 40 deaths.The European agency said the highest concentration of cases was reported in Romania.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Also see: <https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-measles-monitoring-european-outbreaks-15-september-2017> for an update on measles case numbers in Europe through 15 Sep 2017 as well as countries outside the EU/EEA.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Greece can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/83>. - Mod.LK]******[3] Papua New Guinea (Sundaun Province)Date: Thu 21 Sep 2017Source: Post-Courier [edited]<http://postcourier.com.pg/measles-outbreak-vanimo/>The Health Department confirmed an outbreak [of measles on 20 Sep 2017], saying that measles is a contagious disease, and it is too early to determine the magnitude of the outbreak and whether the disease has already spread to other parts of the province or country.""The country must be on alert and report immediately to health centres or hospitals if a person presents with fever or rash with runny nose or red eyes and seek medical help,"" Health Secretary Pascoe Kase said.According to the health department, the outbreak was detected on 23 Aug 2017.The provincial team has already responded by sending a vaccination team to schools and villages to vaccinate children enrolled from grades 1-8 and under 5 years old within the catchment area.The province has 18 000 doses of measles vaccine available to vaccinate the targeted population, while the national medical supplies store has sufficient stock to dispatch more vaccines when required,"" he said.Mr Kase said the Health Department has activated its emergency and response plan and is providing technical support to assist with the outbreak response.

Mod.LK, edited]<http://www.correodelcaroni.com/index.php/mas/salud/item/59159-distrito-sanitario-confirma-38-casos-de-sarampion-en-ciudad-guayana>Measles is a reality in Ciudad Guayana after many years when local doctors never saw a case of the disease, as it had been eradicated completely in Venezuela in the year 2014.Sanitary District No. 2 Caroni revealed that, from April 2017 to date, there were 38 confirmed cases of measles between Puerto Ordaz and San Felix and that the outbreak is focused only in this city. To date, there are 38 cases plus an additional 88 suspected cases still awaiting confirmation. Another 15 were discarded.The data were presented by the epidemiologist Keyla Infante, officer of the Sanitary District, in a speech dictated to the doctors of the Family Clinic as part of the preparation they are undertaking to curb the outbreak of measles and prevent expansion to other areas of the state and the country.Statewide in BolÌ var, Ciudad Guayana is the city where they began. There were only 5 more cases reported in the Sifontes municipality (4 in Tumeremo) and one in El Dorado, and they were imported from Ciudad Guayana: 3 children were admitted in the hospital Dr. RaÌ¼l Leoni in San Felix. There was a baby with suspected measles which later was confirmed.According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), outbreaks of measles can occur in territories where vaccination coverage is up to 97 per cent, because of the highly contagious nature of measles via the respiratory pathway. Infectious particles can survive 2 hours in the air and reach 4 meters away. Infected individuals are infectious for up to 21 days, thus the importance of isolation of cases to prevent the spread of the outbreak.74 percent of the confirmed cases had never received vaccine against measles. The Health District is investigating why patients that had been immunized are getting infected.Infante specified that of 88 suspected cases in 11 parishes of Caroni, 42 samples were sent to the National Institute of Hygiene in Caracas and should arrive in the next few days to confirm or rule out more infections of measles.The parish with the most confirmed cases is Vista al Sol, in San Felix, with 11 confirmed cases plus 18 suspected infections and only 2 discarded. Dalla Costa followed with 8 confirmed cases, 5 suspected, and 2 discarded; then Chirica, with 6 confirmed measles cases, 4 suspicious, and 3 discards. ...-moreInfante explained that the Caroni municipality is a city of high risk for diseases because of the high movement of people there who come from all over the country and the world.He mentioned that 74 per cent of confirmed measles cases had not been immunized with the SRP (previously called injection trivalent vaccine) and that they are studying the reason that allowed the 26 per cent who were vaccinated to contract the virus. This vaccine has not been scarce in the country in the last year. ...morePAHO in September 2016 declared that Latin America was free of measles, when Brazil managed to eradicate the disease in the 2 previous years. China and European countries still have outbreaks of measles. The case of Venezuela reversed the status of Latin America as free of measles. This is not the 1st disease eradicated that resurfaced in the last 2 years. Diphtheria re-emerged in April 2016 after being extinct in Venezuela for 24 years. ...more[Byline: Oriana Faoro]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It's not surprising that vaccine preventable diseases are on the rise in Venezuela, what with the current economic crisis the country is facing.
