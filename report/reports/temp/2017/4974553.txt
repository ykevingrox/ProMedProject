The team held a series of public workshops and committee meetings, did an extensive literature review, and considered written submissions. Findings and recommendations were published in a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.Ethics, other clinical trial challenges: As West Africa's Ebola outbreak spiraled quickly out of control -- with no drugs or vaccines to battle the disease -- the World Health Organization (WHO) was swamped with proposals for possible treatments, as well as vaccines, and with them, the need for clinical testing...more]14 Apr 2017: Huge genome study dissects Ebola outbreak's spread<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/04/huge-genome-study-dissects-ebola-outbreaks-spread>[The largest genome sample ever analyzed for a human epidemic reveals that the West Africa epidemic unfolded with small, overlapping outbreaks as the virus spread over short distances and that urban settings amplified the spread. Meanwhile, another study harnessed different advanced scientific tools in the blood of a single sick patient to detail gene-level response during infection.Factors fueling outbreak spread: In a massive international collaboration, 93 scientists from 53 institutions in 16 countries contributed to the analysis of 1610 Ebola virus genomes from the outbreak, composing 5 percent of all known cases."" ...more...Citation. Dudas G., Carvalho M., Bedford T., et al. (12 April 2017). Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic. Nature, doi:10.1038/nature22040Abstract. The 2013-2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1610 Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5percent of the known cases. We test the association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic ""gravity"" model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighboring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics.]Vaccines------10 Apr 2017: A review of Phase I trials of Ebola virus vaccines: what can we learn from the race to develop novel vaccines?<http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1721/20160295>[Citation. Lambe T., Bowyer G., Ewer K.J. (10 Apr 2017). A review of Phase I trials of Ebola virus vaccines: what can we learn from the race to develop novel vaccines? The Royal Society Publishing, DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2016.0295Abstract. ""Sporadic outbreaks of Ebola virus infection have been documented since the mid-1970s, and viral exposure can lead to lethal haemorrhagic fever with case fatalities as high as 90%. There is now a comprehensive body of data from both ongoing and completed clinical trials assessing various vaccine strategies, which were rapidly advanced through clinical trials in response to the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) public health emergency. Careful consideration of immunogenicity post vaccination is essential but has been somewhat stifled because of the wide array of immunological assays and outputs that have been used in the numerous clinical trials. We discuss here the different aspects of the immune assays currently used in the Phase I clinical trials for Ebola virus vaccines, and draw comparisons across the immune outputs where possible; various trials have examined both cellular and humoral immunity in European and African cohorts. Assessment of the safety data, the immunological outputs and the ease of field deployment for the various vaccine modalities will help both the scientific community and policy-makers prioritize and potentially license vaccine candidates. If this can be achieved, the next outbreak of Ebola virus, or other emerging pathogen, can be more readily contained and will not have such widespread and devastating consequences.This article is part of the themed issue 'The 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic: data, decision-making and disease control' "".10 Apr 2017 West Africa: New Phase II trial begins in West Africa to assess various Ebola vaccine candidates<http://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/news/newsnew-phase-ii-trial-begins-in-west-africa-to-assess-various-ebola-vaccine-candidates-5782766>[A new Phase II clinical trial has begun in West Africa to evaluate 3 vaccination strategies for the prevention of Ebola virus. The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) are conducting the trial under the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccination (PREVAC) international consortium. The vaccine candidates for the PREVAC trial are being supplied by pharmaceutical firms Janssen Vaccines & Prevention, Bavarian Nordic and Merck Sharp & Dohme. The 2-stage, randomized, Phase II trial will compare the 3 vaccination strategies with placebo regimens in more than 5000 adults and children to determine the most potential strategy. ...more]11 Apr 2017: Inovio Ebola vaccine demonstrates robust immune responses with favorable safety profile in expanded clinical trial<http://ir.inovio.com/news/news-releases/news-releases-details/2017/Inovio-Ebola-Vaccine-Demonstrates-Robust-Immune-Responses-with-Favorable-Safety-Profile-in-Expanded-Clinical-Trial/default.aspx>[Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:INO) announced today [11 Apr 2017] preliminary results from the expanded stage of its phase I study, EBOV-001. The expanded study examined different regimens of its Ebola DNA vaccine INO-4201 using intradermal (skin) administration. The results across both stages of the trial, including both intramuscular and intradermal delivery, demonstrated that 95 percent (170/179) of evaluable subjects generated an Ebola-specific antibody immune response, with the mean antibody titer comparable or superior to those reported from viral vector-based Ebola vaccines.Importantly, Inovio's Ebola vaccine was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile compared to viral vector-based Ebola vaccines, some of which have been associated with serious adverse events including myalgia, arthralgia, fever, and rash. Furthermore, their faster construct design, ability to continue to boost immune responses and protection with additional administrations, easier scalability of manufacturing, and better product thermal stability make DNA vaccines an attractive platform to rapidly respond to emerging global infectious diseases.] ...more[Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow <whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED HealthMaps:Liberia <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>Guinea <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45>Sierra Leone <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46>]
