A large epidemic in 2016-17 prompted concerns that the epidemiology of the virus might have changed, increasing the threat of a pandemic. We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical severity, and time-to-event distributions of patients infected with A H7N9 in the 2016-17 epidemic compared with previous epidemics.MethodsIn this epidemiological study, we obtained information about all laboratory-confirmed human cases of A H7N9 virus infection reported in mainland China as of 23 Feb 2017 from an integrated electronic database managed by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provincial CDCs. Every identified human case of A H7N9 virus infection was required to be reported to China CDC within 24 h via a national surveillance system for notifiable infectious diseases. We described the epidemiological characteristics across epidemics, and estimated the risk of death, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients admitted to hospital for routine clinical practice rather than for isolation purpose. We estimated the incubation periods, and time delays from illness onset to hospital admission, illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment, and hospital admission to death or discharge using survival analysis techniques.FindingsBetween 19 Feb 2013, and 23 Feb 2017, 1220 laboratory-confirmed human infections with A H7N9 virus were reported in mainland China, with 134 cases reported in the spring of 2013, 306 in 2013-14, 219 in 2014-15, 114 in 2015-16, and 447 in 2016-17. The 2016-17 A H7N9 epidemic began earlier, spread to more districts and counties in affected provinces, and had more confirmed cases than previous epidemics. The proportion of cases in middle-aged adults increased steadily from 41 percent (55 of 134) to 57 percent (254 of 447) from the 1st epidemic to the 2016-17 epidemic. Proportions of cases in semi-urban and rural residents in the 2015-16 and 2016-17 epidemics (63 percent [72 of 114] and 61 percent [274 of 447], respectively) were higher than those in the 1st 3 epidemics (39 percent [52 of 134], 55 percent [169 of 306], and 56 percent [122 of 219], respectively). The clinical severity of individuals admitted to hospital in the 2016-17 epidemic was similar to that in the previous epidemics.InterpretationAge distribution and case sources have changed gradually across epidemics since 2013, while clinical severity has not changed substantially. Continued vigilance and sustained intensive control efforts are needed to minimise the risk of human infection with A H7N9 virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[6] Sandwich Eliza AssayDate: 5 Jun 2017Source: FIC (Flu Information Centre/Flu in China) [edited]<http://www.flu.org.cn/en/article_detail?action=ql&uid=MjI0OA&pd=YXRsbXBw&articleId=11611>Although exhibiting no or low virulence in poultry, avian influenza virus H7N9 has caused around 1200 confirmed human infections in China with a case-fatality rate of 30 percent since 2013. A highly pathogenic H7N9 virus (HP-H7), with the HA antigenicity distinct from the previous one, were recently detected in patients and poultry. Therefore, convenient rapid diagnosis with reliability will allow early antiviral use and management for H7N9 infection. Here, a sandwich ELISA targeting the conserved viral antigen, neuraminidase (NA) was developed. The immunoassay employed mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3C1 to specifically capture the N9 and 3E9 for the detection. Its limit of detection is 6.25ng/ml for N9 protein of A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9, AH1/2013) and 0.125HAU/50Ã« l for live virus, AH1/2013 and A/Environment/Jiangxi/28/2009 (H11N9), respectively. When applied to test the 5 clinic throat swabs from H7N9 patients confirmed by nuclear acid testing (NAT) using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), 2 samples showed a positive result in sandwich ELISA, while all were negative using commercial Flu A and H7 subtype rapid antigen tests (RAT). The ELISA using anti-N9 mAbs provided a valuable approach to detect H7N9 virus and quantify the N9 protein.Ref. Yu Y, Zhang X, Zhao B, Sun Y, et al.
