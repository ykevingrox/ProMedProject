EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]No release on EHEC strain analysis from the 2 Japanese outbreaks yet. Below is confirmation of the genetic type of 2 cases (teenage female and 80s male) from Yokohama matched to each other (1,2), but they were not able to isolate pathogen nor identify its genetic material in the food commodity collected from the restaurant (3). The shared 4 items of fresh vegetable salad, boneless short rib, almond tofu, cooked white rice, and a couple more meat slices for yakiniku [grilled meat] were investigated. Further investigation is on the way.1. NHK News Web. 24 Aug 2017: <http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20170824/k10011109651000.html> [in Japanese]2.

The potato salad has sickened 14, including a 5 year old girl who is in a critical condition along with 2 others who are severely ill.The supermarket's deli -- known as Derishasu Kagohara -- purchased the potato salad from a food processing facility located outside the prefecture and then mixed it with cut pieces of ham and apples. Kumagaya Public Health has ordered the deli closed for 3 days while it investigates the source of the _E. coli_ infection and its distribution.The investigation into the illness of a boy admitted to the Gunma Prefecture hospital on [14 Aug 2017] led to the deli's contamination. The deli appears to have sold the 1st suspect potato salad on [7-8 Aug 2017], after which 8 Saitama residents reported stomach pains. Others, ages 7 to 12, were treated for diarrhea. The 5 year old has developed the kidney-threatening disease known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS.The potato salad distribution is apparently limited to the Gunma and Saitama prefectures. Businesses in Ota, Gunma apparently re-sold the bagged potato salad, also after mixing it with ham and apple pieces. Health officials from the Takasaki Municipal government took salad samples for additional testing.The teenage girl and man in his 80s both dined at the suspected restaurant on [30 Jul 2017] and both required hospitalization. Their O157 strain matched bacteria found in the suspended restaurant.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The Gunma and Saitama Prefectures outbreak is now up to 14 cases. It is not clear that the Yokohama cases are related to it. - Mod.LLMaps of Japan can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/cities_of_japan_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9764>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
