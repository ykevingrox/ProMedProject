PLoS Negl Trop Dis 11(8): e0005462. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005462Is Mayaro virus infection the latest in a series of new arbovirus diseases expanding across the Western Hemisphere?Since the launch of the 2000 Millennium Development Goals, we have seen an explosion of new arboviruses affecting the Americas. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, there has been a 143.1 percent increase in dengue fever cases between 2005 and 2015 [1], while between 1990 and 2013, dengue incidence in the Caribbean and tropical regions of Latin America increased several fold [2]. In 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) was discovered in New York City, and by 2004, it had reached the West Coast [3]. Since its introduction, WNV has clinically affected more than 41 000 people, causing more than 1700 deaths in the United States alone [4]. Then, in 2013-2014, both chikungunya virus and Zika virus infections emerged in the Americas, with both viruses rapidly spreading to dozens of countries over the course of one year. Both viruses have now affected millions of people, resulting in widespread morbidity [5, 6]. The factors responsible for the rapid expansion of arboviruses in the Western Hemisphere are still under investigation, but they likely include some of the new ""Anthropocene"" forces of climate change, deforestation, economic downturns and poverty, and the changing patterns of human migrations and urbanization [7].But it does not look like the emergence and rapid expansion of new human arbovirus infections will abate anytime soon. In addition to Bourbon, Cache Valley, chikungunya, Heartland, Itaqui, Oropouche, Powassan, and Zika viruses [5], one of the latest to cause concern is Mayaro virus infection.Like chikungunya virus, Mayaro virus is an alphavirus and a member of the Togaviridae family of enveloped RNA viruses (Fig 1) [5, 6]. Mayaro virus was 1st isolated by Charles Anderson and his colleagues during the 1950s from humans with febrile illnesses in Trinidad and later characterized as an alphavirus by Jordi Casals and L. Whitman [8,9]. Subsequent outbreaks were reported from Bolivia and Brazil [10].Mayaro virus has since been identified in the Amazon and other tropical regions of South America, where it has been mostly transmitted by _Haemogogus_ mosquitoes and likely involves forest-dwelling nonhuman primates and possibly migratory birds as animal reservoirs [11]. However, the urban mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ has now been also shown to be an experimental vector for Mayaro virus [12], so there is concern that just as yellow fever virus can exhibit a sylvatic (jungle) enzootic cycle to become urbanized and utilize _Aedes_ mosquito species, Mayaro virus could follow a similar path [13]. However, it is still unknown whether _Ae. aegypti_ or other _Aedes_ mosquitoes are efficient vectors for Mayaro virus. In addition, there is a single report of Mayaro virus isolation from birds [14], but the role of birds in virus transmission remains unstudied.Human Mayaro virus infection produces a constellation of symptoms that closely resemble the alphavirus infection caused by chikungunya, including fever, rash, and severe and prolonged arthralgias [6, 15]. One of the largest outbreaks of Mayaro virus was reported in 2015 by Scott Weaver's group in a rural village located in northwestern Venezuela, where 77 cases were reported, including 19 individuals confirmed as seropositive [16]. Such findings together with the 1st report of Mayaro virus infection in an HIV-infected patient [17] prompted concerns that Mayaro virus could become an important emerging pathogen in South America [16], leading to early attempts to develop attenuated or other vaccines [18]. However, it remains unclear if there have been any significant ecological changes associated with the Venezuelan outbreak or whether the findings reflect improvements in pathogen surveillance technologies.In 2016, Mayaro virus was recovered from an 8-year-old boy with an acute febrile illness in a ""semirural"" area (Gressier-Leogane) approximately 20 miles west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti (Fig 2) [19]. Of note, the patient was found to be coinfected with dengue virus [19]. The fact that Mayaro virus infection was found in someone from a nonforest area and it occurred in the context of a dengue coinfection suggests that _Ae. aegypti_ may have been the mosquito vector responsible for transmission. It has been further noted that Haiti is not native to wild nonhuman primates, which could suggest a different reservoir or human-to-human transmission by _Aedes_ mosquitoes.Could Mayaro virus infection become the ""next chikungunya"" in the Americas? Drs. Mario Luis Garcia de Figueiredo and Luiz Tadeu Moraes Figueiredo from Brazil's prestigious University of Sao Paulo have suggested that both of these alphaviruses can ""mutate and/or adapt to new zoonotic cycles and thus acquire a higher potential for emergency"" to cause significant epidemics [20]. This is an important hypothesis that requires investigation but one that will be complicated to investigate given the possible immunological cross-reactivities to these 2 alphaviruses.The Caribbean and tropical regions of Latin America have now become high-risk areas for the emergence of Mayaro virus infection epidemics. The countries at highest risk of emergence are also resource limited and lack diagnostic capacity at the local level; therefore, it is highly likely that any Mayaro virus infections would be presumed as chikungunya virus due to the similarity of clinical symptoms, possibly allowing rapid transmission and subsequent spread throughout Central and North America to occur under our global health radar.With locally acquired infections of both chikungunya and Zika virus now occurring in Texas and Florida in the US, we would presume these areas to also be at high risk for emergence of Mayaro virus. In May of 2016, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported on the 1st locally acquired case of chikungunya in Cameron County, Texas [21], while 2 years earlier, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on chikungunya transmission in Florida [22]. In August 2016, Zika virus emerged in Florida with the 1st cases of local transmission identified in Miami, and by November, the 1st locally acquired case was reported from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas [23]. Therefore, we are also concerned about the emergence of Mayaro virus infection in North America, including the US.Emerging arbovirus infections have become a ""new normal"" for the Americas [24], including now the continental US, which has seen dengue [25], WNV, chikungunya, and Zika [26] outbreaks over the last 15 years. As we think about public health emergency preparedness and the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) for 2017, we now need to add Mayaro virus infection to the growing list of emerging arbovirus diseases.--Communicated by:Roland HubnerSuperior Health CouncilBrussels, Belgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[Because of the clinical similarities of Mayaro, chikungunya, and dengue virus infections, one cannot help but wonder how many MAYV infections in the South American tropics and perhaps in the Caribbean are incorrectly attributed to dengue or chikungunya virus infections in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Mayaro fever is a disease that begins with a nonspecific fever and fatigue. A rash may occur over the body, accompanied by headache and joint pain. Because they are symptoms similar to those of chikungunya fever, the diagnosis must be made through laboratory tests. Laboratory diagnosis of Mayaro virus infection is made by serological methods -- IgM ELISA -- in cases of acute febrile syndromes after the 6th or 7th day after symptoms begin. To achieve effective surveillance of Mayaro virus infections, public health and hospital laboratories around tropical Americas will have to acquire the capability to conduct IgM ELISA tests. Test results will need to be compiled by Ministries of Health.The transmission cycle of Mayaro virus is very similar to yellow fever virus, with primates as reservoir hosts and _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes as vectors. Human cases are associated with recent exposures to humid forest environments that the vectors inhabit. However, if _Aedes aegypti_ are efficient vectors of the virus, there is a real risk of spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle to an urban one with ongoing transmission. As the authors of the above report ask, are we seeing the tip of a large Mayaro infection iceberg?The above report has maps, figures and a relevant bibliography that interested readers may wish to see. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.]
