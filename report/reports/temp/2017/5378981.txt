Folkehelseinstituttet [edited]<https://www.fhi.no/nyheter/2017/utbrudd-av-e.-coli-infeksjoner-ehec/>Since August 2017, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has found the same variant of the bacterium _E. coli_ O157: H7 in 4 persons. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health was informed in mid-August 2017 of a child with _E. coli_ O157: H7 infection that developed Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and was a resident of MÌüre og Romsdal. In addition, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has detected the same bacterial strain in 3 adults with diarrhea symptoms living in Hedmark, Buskerud and Hordaland. EHEC is the abbreviation for entero hemorragic _E. coli_.""We have good procedures on how we monitor infection with EHEC infection,"" says Director General Line Vold at the Institute of Public Health. We collaborate with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, the municipal authorities and the Veterinary Institute. Depending on the need, interviews are conducted by the sick, as well as possible sampling in relevant foods and close contacts. Since the patients reside in different counties, the investigation of the outbreak is coordinated by the National Institute of Public Health.""None of the investigations around these cases have so far revealed any common source of infection. This work takes time and is complicated. It is not always possible to find the source of infection, "" says Line Vold.General preventive measures against E. coli arrhythmia: - All food (including meat, dough, hamburgers, meatballs, etc.) should be well cooked or cooked. - Other meat products should be well cooked on the surface. - Avoid unpasteurized milk and products made from unpasteurized milk. - Vegetables to eat raw should be washed well. - Store the food at coolant temperature (+ 4 å¡ C) [39.2 å¡F]. - Wash hands after toilet visits, after contact with animals and before cooking and meals. - Wash knives, cutlery and kitchenware that have been contaminated with raw materials before using the equipment for other food. - When traveling to countries with poor hygienic conditions, it is also important to avoid uncooked vegetables, ice cream that is not prepackaged by the manufacturer, and fruit that cannot be peeled. By the way, when traveling abroad, you should generally ensure that vegetables and fruits are well washed with clean water and avoid drinking water not sold in bottles.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED would like more information about the cluster and if the cases are related genetically or by a common vehicle. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/107>.]
