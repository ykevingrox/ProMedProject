The Himalayan Times [edited]<https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/scrub-typhus-dengue-cases-rise/>Two patients each from Chitwan and Syangja districts died of [scrub typhus] earlier. As many as 300 cases of scrub typhus have been recorded in 32 districts so far this year [2017], according to Dr Bhim Acharya, Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Teku.Of the 300 scrub typhus cases, 139 were from Chitwan alone. Last year [2016], 509 people had tested positive for the disease in the district, and 4 had died.Scrub typhus, also known as tsutsugamushi disease, is an infectious illness caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ and is transmitted to humans and rodents by the bite of the larva of trombiculid mites (chigger). ""The mites are both vector and reservoir of the disease. The disease is transmitted from mites to rats and mice, and the mites in their larval stage contract the disease by biting these rodents,"" said Dr Anup Bastola, consultant in tropical medicine and physician at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital [Kathmandu].However, the disease is not directly transmitted from person to person. Human beings of all ages, including children, are affected by it. Those involved in agriculture and living near forest areas are advised to stay away from rodents.Doctors have advised people with high fever to immediately visit health centres.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Chitwan district is in the southwestern part of Province No. 3, and Syangja district is located in the southwestern part of Province No. 4.
