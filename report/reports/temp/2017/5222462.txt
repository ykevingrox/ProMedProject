Los Angeles Daily News [edited]<http://www.dailynews.com/health/20170731/la-county-on-alert-after-hepatitis-outbreaks-among-homeless-in-california-counties>Outbreaks of hepatitis A among the homeless populations in San Diego and Santa Cruz counties prompted an alert by Los Angeles County health officials Monday [1 Aug 2017] to urge physicians and health care workers to look for and report any confirmed cases. The alert was issued because the disease has the potential to spread to Los Angeles County, health officials warned. The outbreaks in San Diego and Santa Cruz counties are among homeless people who may or may not be using drugs and is being spread ""person-to-person through close contact or through contact with a fecally contaminated environment,"" according to the alert.A similar alert was issued by public health officials in Orange County, where one resident developed hepatitis after spending time in San Diego. The man had a history of homelessness. Los Angeles County health officials identified 2 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in local homeless patients who lived in San Diego during their exposure period, according to the alert. Two other people were identified in a health facility.Health officials said the best way to prevent an outbreak in Los Angeles County is to vaccinate those who are homeless and/or who use illicit drugs.Hepatitis A is a liver disease whose symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, joint pain, and a yellowing of the skin or eyes or jaundice.As of last week, there were 275 cases reported and 8 deaths in San Diego County [now 295 and 10; see below. - Mod.LL]. In Santa Cruz County, 38 cases have been confirmed.""These cases and the proximity of Los Angeles County and San Diego highlight the possibility that additional cases may be introduced into Los Angeles County in the future and could result in an outbreak,"" health officials said in the alert. ""It is unknown how long the outbreaks in San Diego and Santa Cruz counties will continue.""[byline: Susan Abram]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] San Diego CountyDate: Tue 1 Aug 2017Source: County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency [edited]<http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/Hepatitis_A.html>Since early 2017, the Public Health Services Division in the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has been investigating a local hepatitis A outbreak. The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless and/or illicit drug users. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified; as a result, the source of the outbreak remains undetermined.Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office.The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. Following this update is information about hepatitis A to educate the community and help prevent the continual spread of this viral infection.San Diego County hepatitis A outbreak cases and deaths as of 1 Aug 2017-------------------Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations295 / 10 / 202 (68 per cent)The table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county, only those that are local-outbreak-related. Also, data are provisional and subject to change. --communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)---------------------------------5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2) 26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5)1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4)In the past week, 20 cases have been reported and 3 deaths. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear whether the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. An epidemiologic curve showing the date of onset of symptoms of cases over time could assist in this regard.Thus, it remains unclear whether the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the fatalities occurred in those individuals.Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading.The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/787>.
