The Hans India [edited]<http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Andhra-Pradesh/2017-09-27/Villagers-await-Pawan-Kalyans-visit-for-spotlight-on-renal-disease-/329329>The scourge of chronic kidney disease (CKD) seems to be pervasive in yet another village, Srirangarajapuram, where people across all ages are suffering from varying levels of debility and enervating (causing a lack of energy or vitality) complications of renal diseases.The common illness is characterised by tell-tale features like bent knees and yellow teeth. With damaged kidneys, people can only walk with the help of a walking stick.The widespread kidney disease recently claimed the lives of 4 persons in the village Viz. Some persons who are bed-ridden have one foot in the grave. They all seem to be fighting a losing battle.According to [PE] and [G] of the village, situated at the tail end of Vizianagaram district, until about 10 years back, most of the people in the village were free from CKD. They used to eke out a living by tending sheep. Kidney diseases started becoming common in the village only over the past decade.On hindsight, people in the village relate it to the defunct open well, which became dysfunctional about 10 years ago. Since then, the villagers, left with no alternative, started drinking water from 4 bore wells. Some of the doctors currently treating kidney patients from the village have linked the illnesses to people drinking water from these bore wells.According to [PS] and [DS], both kidney patients, the matter was taken to the notice of the State government. Subsequently, some doctors did visit the village. They collected samples from the bore wells. Recently, medical officers displayed boards near the bore wells, asking people not to drink the water drawn from them.Officials, however, did not care to provide an alternative and took no step to ensure supply of potable drinking water to the village. Although every other village has NTR Sujala Sravanti, [NTR Sujala program was launched to provide access to safe and clean drinking water to every village affected with high fluoride and salinity levels in ground] there is nothing of that sort in Srirangarajapuram. Successive governments have not bothered to pay attention to the needs of the village.According to [GN], a resident, even if relatives of the local people have some compulsion to visit Srirangarajapuram, they make it a point to bring with them drinking water to meet their needs. They would not even touch tea or coffee offered by the villagers. The guests just finish their work as soon as possible and leave the place.[Byline: P Nagaraju]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[What a tragic situation! If the water samples have been sent for analysis, when did that happen and where are the results? Are the results being withheld for some reason?These people have no other source of water and is it clearly a death sentence to them to continue drinking it? Why is there no concern? It is not the 1st time this disease has come up in this country or this region.ProMED-mail has previously posted about the chronic kidney disease (CKD) in India (Undiagnosed renal disease - India: Uddanam nephropathy, men 20170730.5214750), which seems to indicate that some areas are simply not on the list to be supplied clean water. For all the villagers to pick up and move is quite difficult, especially with a number of them affected by this disease.If these boreholes are the source of the  problem, then one wonders if they can drill another well? Or would it be in the same water table that is apparently contaminated? Should other boreholes be tried in other places? Questions for which there seem no answers at the moment. The water report would certainly shed some light on the situation.As everyone, not just men, as in other previous CKD articles are affected, may mean this situation could involve a slightly different water component content.Readers are encouraged to read the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post 20170730.5214750. - Mod.TG][Srirangarajapuram is a village in Chittoor district, which is located in the southern portion of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srirangarajapuram>).
