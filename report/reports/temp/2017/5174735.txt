Dhaka Tribune [edited]<http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2017/07/14/seven-infected-anthrax-kushtia/>At least 7 people have been confirmed as infected with anthrax at Daulatpur upazila [subdistrict] in Kushtia [district, Khulna division]. Locals said that on [26 Jun 2017], a cow [whose owner was not among the sick. - Mod.MHJ] at Gobra village in the upazila was slaughtered after it had fallen sick. The 7 people were involved with processing and cooking the meat. The owner said that after slaughtering the cow, the meat was sold among the people of the village.After 4 days, many of them fell sick with blisters on their hands and legs and complained of pain, said Arobinda Paul, the upazila health officer. Of them, the 7 were confirmed with anthrax, he said. They were admitted to Daulatpur upazila Health Complex, he told Dhaka Tribune on [Thu 13 Jul 2017].Upazila Live Stock Officer Md Kaz Nazrul Islam said they had taken the necessary measures so that no more people could be infected by the disease.UNO Toufiqur Rahman said, ""If anybody is found involved with slaughtering sick cow, we will take step against him.""--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This newspaper account has a map of Kushtia district and Dualatpur is in the northern half of Kushtia. For a map of Bangladesh go to <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Bangladesh.gif> and Kushtia is on the south bank of the river Ganges, WNW of Dhaka.The 7 affected got off lightly and lucky that no one died. I would presume that the Livestock Officer's ""necessary measures"" were to get ahold of any remaining parts and bits of the carcass and arrange for them to be incinerated. Telling folk to not slaughter and butcher sick cattle is as effective as a public policy of sexual abstinence. Folk hear but they don't listen. Bangladesh is overdue for a livestock anthrax control and surveillance proactive programme, especially in the provinces with repeated outbreaks. Such are cost effective and, if nothing else, it effectively prevents human cases of anthrax which are expensive when the affected end up in hospital. - Mod.MHJ]
