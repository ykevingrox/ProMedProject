It appears that there are now reports of 10 healthcare acquired infections in Riyadh since the middle of May 2017. These 10 cases include one case in a hospital visitor, 7 cases in healthcare workers and 2 cases in patients (one of whom is a fatality).In the 1st 4 days in June 2017, there have been a total of 11 newly confirmed cases/infections with the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, compared with a total of 17 newly confirmed cases/infections during the entire month of May 2017. Of these 11 cases, 9 were reported from Riyadh (7 reported as nosocomial, one under investigation, and one with history of direct contact with camels).As this period of increased incidence coincides with Ramadan, one can't help but wonder whether there has been a change in both animal husbandry, as well as in healthcare settings related to staffing. We do not know whether these nosocomial cases are from one healthcare institution, or whether they involve more than one institution.No, MERS-CoV is not disappearing the way SARS-CoV did.Maps showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases/infections can be found at the source URLs.
