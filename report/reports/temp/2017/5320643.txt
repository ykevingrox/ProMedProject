European center for Disease Control, ECDC, Communicable Disease Threats Report, Week 37, 10-16 September 2017. [edited]<https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/Communicable-disease-threats-report-16-sep-2017_0.pdf>As of [Thu 17 Aug 2017], Greece reported 5 autochthonous cases of _P. vivax_ malaria acquired via vector-borne transmission following a likely exposure in the regions of Dytiki Ellada in West Greece for 4 cases and Sterea Ellada in Central Greece for one case.Greece reports that these cases resulted from a local transmission following recent introduction of _P. vivax_ in the area (introduced cases). The dates of onset of the cases range between 2 May and 22 July 2017.In addition, Greece reported one locally acquired case of _P. falciparum_ in the region of Ipeiros, in north-west Greece, with date of onset of symptoms between 17 and 23 July 2017. The case, who has no travel history to a malaria-endemic area, was hospitalised for a non-infectious medical condition in a ward where another patient was treated for _P. falciparum_ malaria.The most likely place of exposure for this particular case was a healthcare facility but it was not possible to determine the exact mode of transmission (mosquito vector or of iatrogenic origin). The investigation excluded transmission through blood transfusion, but instead suggested a nosocomial transmission, either mosquito-borne within the healthcare facility or of iatrogenic origin. No locally acquired malaria cases were reported in the area.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Greece experienced an outbreak of autochthonous cases of _P. vivax_ malaria in 2011 and 2012. Four cases were reported in 2016. The _P. falciparum_ cases without a travel history were most probably infected through local transmission from the other patient at the same facility, who we presume had a travel history to a falciparum endemic area.It is important to genotype the autochthonous _P. vivax_ to understand the epidemiology. _P. vivax_ occur in 2 major phenotypes, tropical _P. vivax_ with a short incubation period and temperate climate zone _P. vivax_ with an incubation period of up to 8 months (White NJ. Determinants of relapse periodicity in _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria. Malaria J 2011, 10:297 <http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/297>). Haplotyping distinguishes the 2 types of _P. vivax_ malaria (Miao et al. _Plasmodium vivax_ populations revisited: mitochondrial genomes of temperate strains in Asia suggest ancient population expansion. BMC Evol Biol 2012, 12:22; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22340143>). Thus it is important to know which phenotype to understand where and when the patients were infected. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/83>.]
