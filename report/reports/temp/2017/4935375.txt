The North West Star [edited]<http://www.northweststar.com.au/story/4553415/mumps-outbreak-in-the-north/>A mumps virus outbreak in North West Queensland and Gulf country has prompted calls for residents to check their MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccine status.So far this year [2017], 20 lab-confirmed cases of mumps have been recorded in the region, most of whom are indigenous.Mount Isa Public Health Unit Director Dr Steven Donohue said some of the cases are linked to a similar outbreak in the Northern Territory, where about 130 people have acquired the infection since July 2015.""Several patients in the North West outbreak have been fully immunised so we suspect factors such as overcrowding and waning immunity may play a role,"" Dr Donohue said.Dr Donohue said all local clinics and communities have been urged to offer free extra doses of the MMR vaccine to people born after 1965 who did not have at least 2 documented [doses] on their immunisation records. ""People who are in close contact with the patients of the outbreak should get a 3rd dose,"" he said.Prior to this year [2017], just one case of mumps had been recorded by the North West Hospital and Health Service since 2012.Mumps usually causes swelling of parotid salivary glands under the angle of the jaw. Other symptoms include fever, headache and tiredness.In severe cases, the disease can affect the testicles in males or the lining of the brain (meningitis).It spreads easily through sneezing and coughing.Dr Donohue said immunisation was the most effective counter-measure. ""Mumps is a virus so antibiotics do not work,"" he said. ""If given before exposure, vaccination will prevent the disease in the majority of people.""MMR vaccine is routinely given at 12 and 18 months, but catch-up boosters can be given anytime.However the live, weakened vaccine cannot be given to pregnant women, young babies, or people with immune problems.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24533>. - Mod.LK]******[2] USA (Texas, Dallas County)Date: Sat 25 Mar 2017Source: Focus Daily News (FDN) [edited]<http://www.focusdailynews.com/2017/03/25/cedar-hill-isd-continues-mumps-outbreak-dallas-county/>This week Dallas County health officials announced another increase in the number of mumps cases at Cedar Hill High School. According to DCHHS [Dallas County Health & Human Services], since the initial outbreak on [9 Feb 2017], there have been 49 cases reported between students and teachers.That is a drastic increase since the last reported update of 28 cases, as students prepared for the Spring Break holiday [13-17 Mar 2017].Cedar Hill Independent School District [CHISD] borders Ellis County as well, County Spokesperson Renae Crutchfield, did note not all cases are Dallas County residents.To date, there have been 63 mumps cases in Dallas County. DCHHS has also identified 14 unrelated mumps cases in Mesquite, Dallas, and neighboring DeSoto [Dallas County].Cedar Hill ISD Director of Communication Jamie Brown urges calm. He says that the statement from the county health department could easily confuse Cedar Hill residents.""The number Dallas County is reporting represents the total number of cases since [9 Feb 2017]. As of yesterday [24 Mar 2017], all of the teachers and students who were confirmed by the county have returned to class,"" explains Brown. ""We do have some who are absent and are still waiting confirmation from the County.""Although the statistics are finally leaning in a positive direction for CHISD, Brown assures parents that the district has not relented in its efforts to combat the illness.""We are continuing to be vigilant with cleaning and communicating to students about the importance of hand-washing and proper hygiene,"" said Brown. Strict cleaning efforts have been in place since [9 Feb 2017], when the district was first informed of the outbreak from DCHHS. ""We had our cleaning staff do an extensive cleaning of the campus that night,"" said Brown. Furthermore, additional janitorial staff members came in over the weekend to deep clean in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.Since the mumps onslaught the district and DCHHS have partnered to host a number of clinics on the high school campus.""Actually we are playing host and Dallas County is providing the vaccines.""The Centers For Disease Control recommends a 3rd dose, only when an individual has exposure to an ongoing outbreak.""Since February [2017], we have hosted 3 booster shot clinics at the high school. 2 additional for students who come from the Ninth Grade Center to attend classes or activities,"" said Brown.DCHHS Health officials are urging immunization to protect against and prevent the spread of mumps. People with 2 rounds of mumps vaccinations (such as 2 MMR vaccines) are usually immune from mumps.""At 2 doses, the MMR vaccine has 88 percent effectiveness,"" said Dr Christopher Perkins, Dallas County medical director. ""Getting vaccinated is the best option for protection in addition to washing hands frequently and cleaning/disinfecting objects or surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.""Currently Cedar Hill officials are awaiting confirmation from DCHHS on a 3rd round of vaccinations at the Ninth Grade Center.Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Items used by a person suffering from the mumps, such as cups or soft drink cans, could carry the virus, which may spread to others.Mumps patients often show symptoms of fever, headache, and swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches, and loss of appetite. Symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection.[Byline: Joshua C.

Only 2 of those individuals have tested positive, said Kerry McCue, Ellis County health services administrator.Both of those individuals are ""well past"" the contagious period, he said.When a positive mumps case is identified, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment requires a 5-day quarantine.Residents are encouraged to make sure they are vaccinated and might have the option of a ""booster shot"" as a precaution. There is not yet a recommended time when someone should get a booster, but that could change if the outbreak continues, McCue said.""I would assume that with the number of cases that have spread out across the nation, I imagine we'll all be recommended from the CDC to eventually get our 3rd one,"" he said. ""There is not a specific time frame.""There have been at least 79 confirmed mumps cases statewide, according to the most recent data available from KDHE [Kansas Department of Health and Environment].The vaccine is not 100-percent effective, but those who get it are considered 9 times less likely to acquire the virus, he said. ""And if they do get it, it won't be as severe,"" McCue said.There are some exceptions: People who were born before 1957 are considered immune, as they likely already had the virus.2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine typically are recommended for children, 1 dose at between 12 and 15 months, and another between 4 and 6 years of age. Young children are not considered fully vaccinated until they receive the 2nd dose, but they do have some protection, said Kimberly Koerner, infection prevention officer at Hays Medical Center.""That's why we encourage anybody who can be vaccinated to be vaccinated, because they do help increase the coverage for everybody else in the community,"" Koerner said. ""If we have a community that does practice preventative care by getting a vaccine, that helps cover those that aren't fully vaccinated or can't be fully vaccinated.""Vaccines are available at the Ellis County Health Department or through primary care physician clinics.Though the exact source of the outbreak isn't yet clear, KDHE has linked possible exposure to wrestling and basketball events, Kansas State University and the University of Kansas, and travel to other states, according to the agency's website.The most telling symptom is often pain and swelling in the glands below the jaw line. Other -- and often earlier -- symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue, Koerner said. The virus has a lengthy incubation period, with symptoms typically showing 12-25 days after exposure.If anyone suspects they might have the virus, they are encouraged to seek prompt medical attention. Patients, however, should call ahead to notify the medical clinic of their condition so steps can be taken to avoid exposing others, Koerner said.In otherwise healthy patients, the illness doesn't usually lead to severe complications, she said.""It actually used to be very common,"" she said. ""It's become highly uncommon since more people are being vaccinated.""Other preventive measures include practicing good personal hygiene and frequent handwashing. The airborne virus is carried through coughing, sneezing, talking or sharing eating utensils with others.""The number one way to stop the spread of germs is covering your cough and washing your hands,"" Koerner said. ""We always ask people to do that, all the time. And avoid close contact with people when they're sick.""[Byline: Kaley Conner]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Kansas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8703>.

A half-dozen of the affected students are in Chapman's law school, and one is an undergraduate, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency [HCA].The outbreak at the Christian Church-affiliated university in the city of Orange appears to have started [26 Jan 2017], with symptoms showing in one case as recently as last [Thu 23 Mar 2017], the HCA reported.The outbreak correlates with other eruptions in mumps cases at college campuses around the country over the past several years.Most of the affected students were fully vaccinated, which is consistent with other college outbreaks nationally, according to the HCA's Jessica Good. Getting vaccinated lowers the risk of mumps substantially, but doesn't eliminate it, she said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the 2 doses of MMR recommended by doctors -- one at 12-15 months and a 2nd at 4-6 years old -- prevents mumps 88 percent of the time, according to the agency.The ""most characteristic symptom"" of mumps is ""parotid swelling,"" according to the agency. ""Parotitis can initially manifest as earache and tenderness on palpation of the angle of the jaw.""Other symptoms include muscle ache, loss of appetite, malaise, headache or fever.[Byline: Jackie Fernandez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/49257>.

At the heart of that outbreak is the campus of LSU [Louisiana State University]. The 1st cases were reported by the Louisiana Department of Health around [16 Mar 2017], following a major outbreak in Arkansas.The challenge, per assistant state health officer, Dr Parham Jaberi, is that someone infected with the mumps virus may not show symptoms for up to 3 weeks. ""It becomes a challenge because once we identify the problem through public health, we're playing catch up,"" said Dr Jaberi.Symptoms of the mumps include fever, aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. The virus itself is not usually a serious illness and most people recover on their own. However, it is extremely contagious, leaving crowded areas like a college campus at high risk for infection.""Often times, it's spread through kissing, sharing of utensils, personal items, and in concentrated areas where people live close together,"" said Jaberi.The university has reported about 20 cases of mumps so far. Jaberi said there's been a handful of cases in other areas of the state as well. Doctors say a vaccine is the best way to prevent the mumps, but for the vaccine to be most effective, 2 doses are needed. Even then, it's not a guarantee. The Louisiana Department of Health says most of the current cases involve patients who were vaccinated.LSU requires immunizations for new students and recently offered booster shots in coordination with the health department and the CDC. Some preventative tips include:- stay at home for 5 days after symptoms begin; avoid school or work settings;- cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze;- don't share eating utensils, cups, drinking glasses, or water bottles;- clean surfaces that are frequently touched, such as computer devices, television remotes, doorknobs, tables, and counters, regularly with soap and water or with disinfecting wipes;- wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleaner[Byline: Elizabeth Vowell]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Louisiana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/221>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
