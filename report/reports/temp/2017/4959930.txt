Caracol Radio [in Spanish, trans. Mod.JG, edited]<http://caracol.com.co/emisora/2017/04/08/cartagena/1491681959_292523.html>There is an emergency situation going on right now in San Diego Penitentiary, a reclusion center for female inmates in the historical center of Cartagena [Bol√å var department]. Last Saturday afternoon [8 Apr 2017], a massive intoxication was reported. Although little information about this episode is known, many witnesses who live in the vicinity of the penitentiary reported that more than 20 inmates had been taken out in ambulances.The penitentiary administration confirmed that the emergency occurred because some inmates got intoxicated and that they had already been sent to some healthcare facilities. However, no other details of the situation have been revealed. Also, the number of affected inmates is not known.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There is very little information here. If there were a gas leak of some sort then we would expect some guards or facilities managers might be expected. Perhaps a food poisoning? To remove inmates by ambulances is pretty serious, and this report makes me think there may be more than 20. There is not enough information here to hazard a guess at the situation. If someone has more information, please share it. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6617>.].................................................jg/tg/mj/ec/sh"
