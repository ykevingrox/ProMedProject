In the following chart, note the precipitous decline in ""Japanese encephalitis"" incidence which followed introduction of reporting for ""acute encephalitis"" in 2008 (upper graph). This phenomenon is even more striking for India as a whole (lower graph).<https://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/JE-India.png> [1,2] References----------1. Berger S.

ProMED readers are urged to see the graphs that can be accessed at the URL above. Dr Berger accurately describes them and the trends that they illustrate. The good news is that with increased vaccination, the numbers of Japanese (JE) cases have declined. The not so good news is that the numbers of undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have increased.AES continues to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. Clearly, prospective studies are needed to define the causes of AES. Until the etiologies are known, prevention and effective treatment will not be possible.Dr Berger is thanked for sending this information.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Japanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513Japanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (OR) 20170820.5263062Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252Japanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801Japanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (MN) 20170811.5244526Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297Japanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20170805.5229244Japanese encephalitis & other - Asia: India (MN) Bangladesh (RP) 20170801.5216309Japanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20170717.5183403Japanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (BR) 20170713.5170870Japanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20170710.5162050Japanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (JH) susp. 20170705.5151252Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (MH) 20170622.5124128Japanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (OR) 20170620.5119632Japanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (OR) 20170604.5082374Japanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (PB) 20170421.4984702Japanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20170402.4942606Acute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638Japanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20170101.4733821Scrub typhus - India (02): (HP) 20170629.5138780Scrub typhus - India: increasing recognition 20170615.5107234].................................................ml/ty/mj/dk"
