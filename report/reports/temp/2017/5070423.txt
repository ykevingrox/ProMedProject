NBC 29 [edited]<http://www.nbc29.com/story/35415132/vdh-health-officials-investigate-rare-human-case-of-rabies>The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) is investigating a rare case of human rabies in central Virginia.VDH public health veterinarian Julia Murphy says the victim was bitten by a dog in India, but didn't seek any treatment until returning home to the commonwealth (of Virginia) in April [2017]. Murphy says the patient did not get a rabies vaccine, and was diagnosed 5 days ago [Sun 7 May 2017]. Rabies, if left untreated for too long, is most often fatal. ""In this case, this patient's incubation period was roughly 6 weeks, which is not unusual for rabies in people,"" said Murphy.Dr Daniel Sawyer, an infectious disease specialist, said during the 6 week incubation period the patient was most likely not contagious. Sawyer is not involved with treating this patient. ""Coughing is an infrequent way to transmit the disease. So you'd really have to be sick with their bodily fluids - usually saliva - and that sort of thing,"" said Sawyer.VDH is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], as well as the hospital where the patient is being treated. The department is assessing every person who might have come into contact with the patient and is working closely with their family. Officials are also evaluating all health providers who are treating the patient for any signs of the virus.Due to policy, officials cannot confirm where the patient is being treated. However, multiple sources have indicated to NBC29 that the patient is being treated at the University of Virginia (UVA) Medical Center. NBC29 asked the UVA Medical Center to confirm this, but it would neither confirm nor deny the information. [The UVA should not be providing information on any patient and especially one as potentially high profile as a rabies victim. This would violate the privacy regulations. UVA was correct in their response. - Mod.TG]Dr Sawyer says it is uncommon for a person in the US to have rabies: ""There are 1 or 2 or 3 cases per year in this country. So it's pretty rare."" The last known case of human rabies in Virginia was back in 2009. The patient in that case was also bit by a dog in India. He died less than a month later. NBC29 has not confirmed the condition of the patient at this point, however most people who contract rabies and do not have a vaccine die within a few weeks. VDH says the only known human to human transmission cases of rabies have been through organ transplants.VDH is working with CDC and healthcare centers where the patient sought care, to assess any healthcare worker who potentially may have been exposed to rabies virus due to contact with this patient. VDH is also working to identify any family members and close contacts that may have been exposed to rabies virus due to contact with this patient. According to the VDH, no additional information about the individual will be released to protect their privacy. Our thoughts are with the patient and the patient's family.Human rabies cases in the United States are rare, with only 1 to 3 cases reported annually. As many as 28 cases of human rabies have been diagnosed in the United States since 2006, of which 8 cases were infected outside the US and its territories. The last time VDH reported a human rabies case was in 2009. This patient had also traveled to India and was bitten by a dog while there.Those traveling internationally should check with their healthcare providers about vaccinations or other health precautions that are recommended prior to departure.

Earlier this week [week 24 to 30 Apr 2017] 5 young girls were spotted playing with what turned out to be a live bat that tested positive for rabies in Lagrange Park.While it's not known if the girls actually touched the animal -- identifying them and getting them checked out became critical for health officials. Health officials say coming in contact with the saliva of the bats can be extremely dangerous and even deadly.Rabies is a virus that affects the central nervous system. You can contract it from a bite, scratch or even saliva from an infected animal. If untreated, rabies can be fatal.In Lagrange Park, health officials offered a warning that has some parents on alert. ""Bats have really tiny jaws and it's not always obvious when someone has been bitten,"" says Demian Christiansen of the Cook County Department of Public Health. ""Since rabies is fatal, we really don't want to take any chances.""The girls have all been located and referred to the health department. It's unclear if they were exposed to rabies. ""I'm glad the health department stepped in and hopefully nothing bad will come out of it,"" said parent S. She faced a similar situation when one of her daughters found a dead rabbit and brought it to school. We had to go to the doctor,"" she recalled. ""We went through a little ordeal -- because it's scary.""Health officials say you should not handle bats whether they are dead or alive. If you see a bat, call your area's animal control, officials say.[byline: Regina Waldroup]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] New Hampshire - fox, human exposureDate: Thu 4 May 2017, 7:57 PMSource: Bennington Banner [edited]<http://www.benningtonbanner.com/stories/fox-responsible-for-londonderry-attacks-tests-positive-for-rabies,506431>The gray fox that attacked 2 Londonderry residents on [Sat 29 Apr 2017] has tested positive for rabies. The fox had been sighted multiple times across Londonderry, and the animal's suspicious behavior led local officials to suspect that it had been rabid.""We had 2 unprovoked attacks by a fox on humans and they both happened on the same day,"" said Kevin Beattie, Londonderry's emergency management director. ""They were both in the same fairly small area, so we were pretty sure it was the same fox that did both attacks.""BC was the fox's 1st victim, taken by surprise outside of her mother's house in Londonderry. ""It came out of nowhere. I never saw it until it was on me. I was able to turn quickly to get it off me, but it jumped on me again and bit me on the knee,"" said BC. As the bite had broken her skin, BC rushed to the emergency room for a series of rabies shots. ""It did act strangely,"" said BC. ""Had I known, or had I seen it, I would have run for the house.""Soon after, Londonderry's game warden David Taddei pulled into BP's residence to warn him of the attack. About an hour later, while BP and his family were playing wiffle ball in their yard, the fox struck again. ""I just happened to be about 10 or 15 feet [3-5 metres] from my 5 year old and saw it running toward him,"" said BP. ""It nipped at the right side of his belly, and I just reacted and was able to kick the fox off of him.""""The minute I saw it I knew it was the same fox, and it wasn't getting out of there alive,"" said BP. ""There was a shovel nearby, so when the fox began to crawl out from under the playset I hit it and it just dropped."" The game warden immediately had the animal tested for rabies, and on [Tue 2 May 2017] those results came back positive. ""This type of aggressive unprovoked attack is rather unusual even for rabid animals,"" said Beattie. ""We haven't seen any more animals acting strangely since then, or had another incident fortunately.""Immediately following Saturday's attacks Beattie put out a public notice on Londonderry's community forum on Facebook, as well as to his email list of about 600 residents. Following Tuesday's positive test results, officials sent out a 2nd notice. ""The chances of another rabies infected animal in the area are hard to predict but definitely possible,"" read the notice from the State Veterinarian and the Game Warden. ""Be observant and watch for wild animals that may be acting unusual.""While such aggressive attacks are uncommon, sightings of rabid animals are not. So far there have been 2 reported cases of rabid animals this year [2017] in Bennington County, both in Manchester. In 2016 there were 10 confirmed cases of rabid animals in Bennington County, though more unconfirmed cases are likely.""I think it's very traumatic that the 5 year old did get attacked, but at the end of the day the outcome was good,"" said BP. ""We were able to get the fox so it couldn't hurt anyone else."" Both victims of Saturdays attack are receiving treatment, and are expected to make a full recovery.[byline: Cherise Madigan]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Indianapolis - bat, human exposureDate: Tue 9 May 2017, 11:11 AMSource: WNDU [edited]<http://www.wndu.com/content/news/Rabid-bat-bites-St-Joseph-County-resident-421755653.html>Beware of bats: that was the warning sounded [Tue 2 May 2017] by the St Joseph County Humane Society after a bat tested positive for rabies. That bat bit a human being. St Joseph County hasn't had a rabies test on a bat come back positive since 2014.Late last week [week 1 to 7 May 2017] at a home in southern St Joseph County, an adult female encountered a bat in her bedroom. ""In this particular case the bat was in a bedroom and you know, the person, from my understanding was getting ready for bed. The bat was in the room and she got bit,"" said Humane Society director Genny Carlson. ""There was a clear indication that she was bit but some cases with bats you might not know that you actually got bit because their teeth are so razor sharp.""Carlson says the woman in question sought immediate treatment for rabies and is expected to be okay. In 2006, a 10 year old Marshall County girl died after being bitten by a bat. ""If you are exposed to rabies and you don't get immediate treatment, maybe you don't even know that you were exposed directly, and 3 or 4 months go by and you start showing symptoms, it's very possible that you could die from that illness,"" said Carlson. Carlson says the situation also serves as a reminder that the law requires any dog, cat, and ferret over the age of 12 weeks to have a rabies vaccination.St Joseph County officials revealed [on Tue 2 May 2017] that a resident was recently bitten by a rabid bat. ""While the diagnosis indicates the presence of the disease in the area, all Hoosiers should take a few common sense precautions every day to protect their families and pets against the disease, regardless of where they live,"" the Humane Society of St Joseph County advised in a media release.St Joseph County residents should not be alarmed at the recent local discovery of a rabid bat in the region. While the diagnosis indicates the presence of the disease in the area, all Hoosiers should take a few common sense precautions every day to protect their families and pets against the disease, regardless of where they live.Rabies is a viral disease spread primarily through the bite of an infected animal. Dr Sandra Norman, a veterinarian with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health, recommends the following guidelines to reduce the risk of rabies exposure to people and animals:- avoid contact with wild animals (not just bats) at all times. Do not feed or handle wild animals, and secure any trash and pet food in animal-proof containers. Cover attic and chimney openings and other entry points in the home, which may invite unwanted visitors.- wild animals are generally active at night and avoid contact with people. Daytime contact with humans is unusual, and should be viewed suspiciously.- Indiana law requires all dogs, cats and ferrets 3 months of age or older be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed, accredited veterinarian. Pets should be kept close to home, as free-roaming animals are at higher risk of exposure to the disease.- if your pet is bitten or attacked by a wild animal, contact your veterinarian and local animal control. Your pet will need a booster if the animal is determined to be rabid.- if you or someone in your family is bitten or scratched by a wild or stray animal or a pet, attempt to confine or kill the animal or determine the owner of the pet (if this can be done without risk of further injury). Wear leather or latex gloves when handling all animals with possible exposure (dead or alive).- immediately wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Call your physician at once to determine treatment and make sure the bite is reported to the local department of health and animal control.For more information about rabies prevention and safety, visit the Indiana State Board of Animal Health online at <www.boah.in.gov>.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] North Carolina - fox, human and pet deathsDate: Mon 8 May 2017, 7:51 PMSource: WITN [edited]<http://www.witn.com/content/news/Fox-attacks-Craven-County-couple-and-kills-pets-421681873.html>Authorities now confirm a fox that attacked 2 people last week [week of 1 to 7 May 2017] in Craven County was rabid.Scott Harrelson, director of the Craven County Health Department, says that a man on Tuscarora Rhems Road was working [on Fri 5 May 2017] night outside his home when the fox ran out of the woods and attacked the man's pet duck and chicken, killing both of them. Harrelson says the fox then turned and attacked the man, biting him twice on the legs. It then ran up on the porch of the home and attacked a woman, who was sitting outside. Harrelson says that thankfully a neighbor came to their rescue and beat the fox with a rake.The fox was sent to the state lab for rabies testing. If it is rabid the 2 victims will have to undergo a series of shots to protect themselves from the deadly virus. [Given the way the fox attacked without warning, it should be presumed the animal has rabies, and post exposure prophylaxis should begin. - Mod.TG]The test came back positive for rabies, according to the health department. The 2 victims now have to undergo a series of shots to protect themselves from the deadly virus.While this particular couple may not have been able to avoid the fox, the health department says what happened can serve as a strong reminder for others of the importance of staying away from rabid animals if possible, and to call authorities if you spot any animal acting strangely or out of the ordinary. Officials also say this encounter should remind pet owners to keep their animals up to date on their rabies vaccines.[byline: Dave Jordan and Stacia Strong]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[6] Arizona - fox, human exposureDate: Wed 17 May 2017Source: Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) [edited]<https://www.azgfd.com/rose-canyon-lake-temporarily-closed-by-search-for-potentially-rabid-fox/>Rose Canyon Lake campground on Mount Lemmon is temporarily closed pending a search by state and federal wildlife officials for a potentially rabid fox that bit a 12 year old Tucson boy's knee at 5 pm on [Sun 14 May 2017].The boy was treated for his wound and rabies [likely this is post exposure prophylaxis against rabies and is a series of injections. - Mod.TG] at Tucson Medical Center, and released. The fox ran off after biting the boy, who was playing with his dog at the time of the attack. The fox is assumed to still be in the area since they have relatively small territories.The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) recommended the campground closure to the Coronado National Forest on [Mon 15 May 2017], when they helped clear campers from the area and searched for the fox unsuccessfully using wildlife calls. The temporary closure is expected to be short-term while wildlife officials further assess the situation. Rose Canyon Lake is stocked by AZGFD with fish and is popular with anglers.Clearly ill, dying or dead foxes have been recovered for rabies testing 3 times since March [2017], from the Sweetwater Drive, Picture Rocks, and Sabino Canyon areas.""Avoid contact with and don't approach wildlife behaving abnormally or appears to be ill. If you believe that you see a rabid animal, call us at 1-623-236-7201 or the Pima County Health Department at 520-724-7797 immediately,"" said regional supervisor Raul Vega of Game and Fish in Tucson. ""In addition, avoid touching any dead wildlife that you may find, and keep your pets away from them as well.""Vega added that pets such as dogs and cats, as well as livestock like horses, should be regularly vaccinated for rabies. In addition, dogs should be on leashes when outdoors, and a veterinarian consulted if any domestic animals are injured by wildlife, he said. Unvaccinated animals exposed to wildlife with rabies must undergo a 4 month quarantine. [Most states indicate if the bite was known to be from a rabid animal, then the unvaccinated pet is euthanized. Each state has some slightly different regulations regarding a pet exposure and quarantine. - Mod.TG]Rabies is a preventable viral disease most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system, causing encephalitis (swelling of the brain). It is almost always fatal once symptoms appear. Rabies can be prevented in persons who have come into contact or have been bitten by wild animals through prompt administration of anti-rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin [post exposure prophylaxis].The principal rabies hosts in Arizona are bats, skunks, and foxes. These animals carry their own distinct rabies virus variants or ""strains."" When rabies within these animal groups increases, rabies can ""spill over"" into other mammal species, such as bobcats, coyotes, javelina, cats, dogs, horses, cows, etc. Rabid animals may appear disoriented or intoxicated, salivate heavily or appear thirsty.About 15 people are exposed to rabid animals in Arizona each year. People who are exposed must receive post exposure prophylaxis [vaccine and anti-rabies serum treatment] to prevent infection.

""It bit her, scratched her a couple of times, and she kept trying to defend the house,"" CF said. M spotted the raccoon in the backyard last week, near where the children were playing. ""It started making sounds at the kids,"" CF said.We're told Animal Control was able to catch it and put it down, but later the raccoon tested positive for rabies. Because CF had come in contact with M's saliva, he also had to be treated for possible rabies contamination. The illness is spread through saliva and can be deadly for both animals and humans.Animal control officer Kevin McDonough is warning Troy residents about this case, and 3 other recent cases involving raccoons acting aggressively. ""There's no cure for rabies; all you can do is go through the series of shots and hope you don't get it,"" McDonough said. [Post exposure prophylaxis regarding rabies is generally very effective. However, it must be administered within a narrow window of time from the time of exposure. - Mod.TG]McDonough says the latest call involving an aggressive raccoon happened [on Thu 11 May 2017] morning on Peterson Court. [Wed 10 May 2017] night, McDonough had a bad encounter with 1 himself, after he was called to a home on Crestwood Avenue. ""The animal attacked me numerous times, and the animal had to be euthanized,"" McDonough said. McDonough wasn't injured and nearby residents are relieved the raccoon was caught.CF still has to go through 2 more rounds of shots to protect him against rabies, but right now he says he's just worried about his dog.""I just don't want my dog to die, that's all,"" CF said.

One of the lambs died within a day, and was not tested for any diseases. [If it was in the same group, perhaps it should have been tested for rabies. - Mod.TG]The male lamb that was confirmed rabid began showing clinical signs of rabies on [Wed 3 May 2017] and was euthanized on [Sun 7 May 2017].The health department received positive lab results on [Wed 17 May 2017]. It is not known at this time how the lamb became infected with the rabies virus. The health department conducted an exposure investigation and interviewed 5 people who may have been in contact with the rabid lamb. To date, 4 of the 5 persons in contact are receiving post-exposure treatment.The New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA) is also involved and has completed an assessment and quarantine of the farm animals. The 3rd lamb that was purchased is in quarantine which is being overseen by the NJDA.The Cumberland health department is obtaining a contact list for the 3rd lamb in case it begins to exhibit signs of rabies and the Salem County Health Department was notified upon receipt of the information that lambs were purchased from the auction. [Hopefully the Salem County Health Department is looking into who at the auction may have had contact with the particular lot of lambs as these people may need treatment. - Mod.TG]The Gloucester County Health Department was also notified because the lambs originated from a farm there. [Hopefully the Gloucester County Health Department is speaking to the original owners of the lamb and determining if there is further exposure in the flock or if the owners need treatment. - Mod.TG]Rabies is a preventable but fatal disease that is usually found in wild raccoons, skunks and foxes. Cats and dogs also can become infected with rabies. Animals that are aggressive, appear disoriented, or more friendly than usual with humans or domestic animals may be infected with rabies. Being bitten by a rabid wild animal is the commonest way for any human, pet or domestic animal to get infected with rabies; contact with animal saliva is also a risk for rabies infection.Residents are urged to check their dog and cat vaccination records and have their pets vaccinated for rabies before the current duration of immunity expires. ""We are asking anyone who may have come into contact with 1 of the lambs involved to please contact the Cumberland County Department of Health,"" said health officer Megan Sheppard. ""The news of another positive rabies case in Cumberland County is an appropriate time to remind residents of the importance of rabies vaccination in order to keep their pets safe and healthy,"" said Sheppard.The Cumberland County Department of Health, along with other agencies, will continue to monitor the situation closely.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[9] South Carolina - skunk, fox, human exposureDate: Tue 23 May 2017Source: The State [edited]<http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article152208132.html>One person in Newberry County and 2 in Kershaw County have started treatment for rabies after being exposed in 2 separate incidents involving wild animals testing positive for rabies, DHEC said in a statement on [Tue 23 May 2017].One person was potentially infected by a skunk on [Tue 16 May 2017] in Newberry County.

The fox was sent to Wadsworth Laboratory for testing and the positive test results were received by the Schoharie County Department of Health last [Mon 15 May 2017]. Several domestic animals and 2 humans were exposed to the fox. The animals were up-to-date with their rabies vaccinations and have received rabies booster shots; the county Department of Health is coordinating the response.Once infected, rabies is a virus that has a 100 per cent fatality rate in mammals, including humans, when left untreated. The following precautions from the Department of Health will help protect family and pets from rabies:- vaccinate pets: New York State law requires that all dogs, cats and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies by four months of age.- vaccination is also recommended for livestock with frequent human contact.- report any sick or strange acting wildlife.- do not feed wildlife or stray animals and discourage them from seeking food near your home.- do not approach an unknown animal, either wild or domestic, especially if it is acting in a strange or unusual manner.- report all animal bites and any contact with bats to the Health Department in your county. Human rabies can be prevented after exposure by administering a series of shots.- keep garbage cans tightly covered and avoid storing any food outside.- children should be instructed to tell an adult immediately if they were bitten or scratched by any animal.- if an unvaccinated pet comes in contact with a wild or domestic animal that many have rabies, the pet must be quarantined for 6 months, at the expense of the owner.- if a vaccinated pet comes in contact with a wild or domestic animal that may have rabies, the pet must be given a booster rabies vaccination within 5 days of the contact.Schoharie County Public Health will provide free rabies vaccinations at the Gilboa Town Highway Garage on [Thu 8 Jun 2017] from 6-8 pm.

The number of rabies cases keeps climbing in Colorado--and so does the concern. A number of health agencies and animal shelters urged residents to vaccinate their dogs and cats--and for good reason. Last year, 88 animals tested positive for the fatal disease. Those animals exposed 113 domestic pets. And, so far this year [2017], we're on pace to surpass those numbers.Veterinarian Kristina Ingram couldn't have imagined what she'd encounter while working at Community Pet Hospital in Thornton about 2 weeks ago. ""He was showing some neurologic signs, tremoring a little bit,"" she said. Dr Ingram examined a 6 week old puppy that ended up testing positive for rabies. It's the 1st time wildlife has infected a dog in Colorado in more than 40 years. ""They have not had a contracted in-the-state canine rabies case since 1974,"" she said. A dog tested positive in Colorado 14 years ago, but it had come in from Texas.""They asked, 'How did he contract rabies?' I said, 'With a wildlife encounter a bite or scratch,"" she told the family. They told her a skunk had scratched the Australian-Shepherd-mix and killed another puppy in Weld County. Skunks are the biggest carrier of rabies so far this year [2017]. A Denver resident captured video of a rabid skunk 3 May 2017. It had been living beneath her porch.Colorado's Department of Health data shows 38 skunks tested positive for rabies so far this year [2017]. That is the most of any animal. A total of 14 of them in Jefferson County alone. That's followed by 5 bats testing positive in 5 counties. [This sentence is slightly unclear: is it 5 bats per county for 5 counties or 1 bat per county for 5 counties? - Mod.TG]. All together in 16 Colorado counties, 48 animals have tested positive with 7 months to go in 2017.""There's nothing we can do. It's fatal once the clinical signs start to show,"" Dr. Ingram said. She said the virus travels to the brain, killing the animal, and risking human lives, too. Pet owners realize vaccinating your pet is the best defense for everyone in the family. ""It's terrifying ... this is a huge public health risk. All humans come in contact with it.""Foothills Animal Shelter offers affordable rabies vaccines every Friday from 4:00 to 5:30 pm and the 1st Saturday of every month from 9:00 to 10:30 am.

Likewise, very few of them discuss vaccination of our domestic pets helps to build a barrier between this disease and ourselves.This collection of reports includes a case of rabies in humans. This is extremely sad as there are only rare cases of humans surviving this disease, and those that do, are usually impaired in some fashion and do not recover completely. Sadly, given the statistics of how few survive, this is likely to be a sad outcome for the person and the person's family. But it should serve as a warning to all that bites from any animal can potentially be serious. If the animal is wild, then one has to believe an unprovoked attack would be from a rabid animal. Likewise, an unprovoked bite from a domestic animal should involve finding out if the animal was vaccinated.While we don't get many reports of sheep having rabies, they clearly do. There is also a vaccine for these animals. It is likely that more sheep have rabies than is actually reported. This may be because of the way sheep are raised. They may be killed by predators, as they could be an easy target.
