EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]The Ibaraki Prefecture Health Department announced on 13 Jun 2017 that the complaint of more than 3000 students of unusual taste and odor of milk and feeling unwell after consuming the milk provided for lunch on [5 Jun 2017], was caused by a different flavor/odor of the milk provided on that day, which was different from the usual milk provided, not by any defects whatsoever.The Department tested the quality of the remaining milk and inspected the production process of the milk on site. A possible reason for the different flavor/odor of the milk may be that the milk came from one particular farm on that day, and not from multiple farms as on other days (<http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20170613/k10011016761000.html> in Japanese)--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberDr Masaki OtaResearch Institute of TuberculosisTokyoJapan*****[2]In answer to a question by Mod.MPP to Dr. Ota, ""In the absence of identifying a substance, is this considered to be a ""hysterical"" event?"" the following reply was received.Date: Fri 16 Jun 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]Considering the lack of a specific cause for all of these students feeling unwell and 2 students presenting vomiting and diarrhea, it is possible that it was fueled by mass hysteria. However, no news media has pointed out that possibility. Therefore, I cannot tell if this was the case. It is my understanding that mass hysteria is more common in a hot and/or humid environment. However, the weather on that day in the Mito area was not very hot but was sunny.----Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberDr Masaki OtaResearch Institute of Tuberculosis Tokyo, Japan[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Masaki Ota for these submissions. - Mod.DKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>.]
