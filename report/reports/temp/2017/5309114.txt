The infection is followed by contact with sick animals. The man lived in the village in the state Khelvachauri district of Adjara.He turned to a medical facility too late. Doctors diagnosed him with the skin form of the disease, which developed as a result of contact with infected animals, according to a [Thu 7 Sep 2017] ""Georgia online"" report with reference to Sakashvili Khatuna, the head of the Service of Infectious Diseases, The National Center for Disease Control & Public Health.Since the beginning of the year [2017], Georgia has recorded 20 cases of cutaneous anthrax. A similar number was recorded last year [2016]. The cutaneous form is the most commonly reported, and usually follows from the slaughter and butchering of sick livestock.--Communicated by:ProMED-RUS<promed-rus@promedmail.org>[Every year in Georgia, 20-30 cases of Siberian ulcers in humans are recorded. The most significant rise in the incidence was noted in 2011, when anthrax infected 70 people, one of whom died. It is mainly an infection associated with the slaughter and butchering of sick animals. Often the infected meat gets into the distribution network. The main reasons for this happening is insufficient preventive measures, low veterinary monitoring of vaccination and slaughter, sanitary control at markets, etc. The cutaneous form of the disease when treated on time usually ends favorably. In this case, it was too late for effective medical help. - Mod.NP][Caught early cutaneous anthrax is easily and successfully treated. If late, it takes more effort as the toxic fluids surrounding the lesion must be actively removed. Antibiotics are not enough, though important, at this stage.Georgia reported to OIE that in 2011 they had 81 human cases with 1 death; and in 2013 142 cases and 1 death. In 2016 they reported livestock (cattle and sheep) outbreaks in 6 provinces and even a canine outbreak. This year outbreaks have already been reported in Samtske-Javaheti (1) and Kakheti (2).The Autonomous Republic of Adjara is in the south west corner of Georgia and abutting on the Black Sea; see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjara>. There are a number of these autonomous republics in Georgia.
