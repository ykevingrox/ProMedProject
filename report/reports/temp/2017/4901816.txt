Daily Times [edited]<http://dailytimes.com.pk/sindh/14-Mar-17/885-chikungunya-cases-reported-in-last-4-months>Official of Sindh Health Department told Daily Times on [Sun 12 Mar 2017] that 23 cases of chikungunya have been reported [since 1 Mar 2017], in Karachi, after which the total number of cases is 885 since the 1st case was reported in December 2016. However, Pakistan Medical Association suggests that the actual number of cases is much higher.In December 2016, 405 cases [were reported], in January [2017] 359 cases, and ""98 cases in February were suspected whereas only 5 cases were conformed when tested from laboratory in Islamabad,"" said Karachi health director Dr Mohammad Taufeeq while talking to Daily Times. According to Dr Taufeeq, the data was being collected from all public sector health hospitals and major private hospitals.The number may seem less because there are some cases which private hospitals cater, he said. Another factor behind the 'increased number' may be is because of public unawareness as every fever is not chikungunya.Chikungunya is a viral disease [transmitted] by mosquitoes, which causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue. The virus remains in the human system for 5 to 7 days; according to experts. Disagreeing with government's data, Dr SM Qaiser Sajjad, Secretary General Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), said the figures are much larger than those quoted by official data.While the number of chikungunya cases is alarming, Dr Masood Solangi, head of the Dengue Control and Surveillance Programme in Sindh, distances itself from the mosquito-borne virus. On the other hand, chikungunya cases were being reported from various towns of the city. There are complaints from local people about poor arrangement of cleanliness drives in the city, a pre-requisite from World Health Organization to make the environment clean.[Byline: Zulfiqar Kunbhar]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Based on the recent report from the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU), from 19 Dec 2016 to 9 Mar 2017, a total of 829 suspected cases were reported from the various parts of Karachi using the following WHO case definition: ""a person with acute onset of fever (102 deg F/38.9 deg C) and severe arthralgia or arthritis not explained by other medical conditions, and who resides or has visited epidemic or endemic areas within 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms.""The highest number of cases were reported from Malir town (n=620), followed by Orangi (n=139) and Lyari town (n=70).
