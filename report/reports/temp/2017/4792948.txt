WHO Surveillance and monitoring, influenza updates [edited]<http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/>Influenza update - 281 (based on data up to 8 Jan 2017)-------------------------------------------------------Summary-------Influenza activity in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere continued to increase, with many countries especially in East Asia and Europe having passed their seasonal threshold early in comparison with previous years. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) virus was predominant. The majority of influenza viruses characterized so far was similar antigenically to the reference viruses contained in vaccines for use in the 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season. All tested viruses collected recently for antiviral sensitivity were susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications.- In North America, influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating. In the United States of America, influenza-like illness (ILI) levels were above the seasonal thresholds and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity continued to be reported.- In Europe, influenza activity was high, with influenza A (H3N2) virus being the most prominent subtype. Persons aged over 65 years were most frequently associated with severe disease from influenza infection.- In East Asia, high influenza activity continued to be reported with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominant.- In Western Asia, influenza activity slightly increased.- In Southern Asia influenza activity remained low in most of the countries. Detection of influenza A (H3N2) virus continued to be reported by the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sri Lanka.- In South East Asia, influenza activity remained low, with influenza A(H3N2) virus and influenza B predominating in the region.- In Northern Africa, influenza detections continued to be reported in Morocco and Tunisia with influenza A(H3N2) virus dominating.- In West Africa, influenza continued to be detected in Ghana with B viruses dominating.- In the Caribbean countries and Central America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low in general.- In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory viruses activity remained low.- In the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 97 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 26 Dec 2016 to 8 Jan 2017 (data as of 20 Jan 2017, 9:52:23 AM UTC).The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 165 297 specimens during that time period; 40 259 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 38 809 (96.4 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1450 (3.6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 422 (2.6 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 15893 (97.4 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 116 (49.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 117 (50.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Based on this update, most of Northern hemisphere countries have reported a slight increase in influenza activity, while some have low or inter-seasonal levels of viral circulation. Among Influenza A viruses, A(H3N2) virus was dominant while for Influenza B, both B-Yamagata and B-Victoria lineages showed equivalent detection rates. - Mod.UBA]
