Philippines News Agency [edited]<http://www.canadianinquirer.net/2017/08/02/208-zambo-jail-inmates-afflicted-with-tb/>The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) has adopted measures to prevent the spread of tuberculosis (TB) at the Zamboanga City Reformatory Center (ZCRC).Roanne Nono of the ZCRC community relations service on [Wed 2 Aug 2017] disclosed that 208 inmates, all males, were tested positive of TB. Nono said they were among the 384 inmates suspected to be afflicted with TB. The others are still undergoing confirmatory tests. Nono said these are on top of the 7 old cases of TB and another 7 cases of multi-drug resistant [MDR] TB they detected at the ZCRC. She said among the measures to stop the spread of the disease is the isolation of the inmates afflicted with TB.TB is an infectious disease caused by bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. It generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze.Nono said they also imposed strict observance of proper hygiene among the inmates. She said they are closely monitoring the medication of inmates positive with TB and well as required to use face mask. The ZCRC has 4 nurses and a volunteer physician who take care of the health of the more than 2500 inmates at the ZCRC.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following has been extracted from a WHO report ""Tuberculosis in Prisons"". The full repot can be found at: (<http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/population-groups/prisons-facts/en/>). - Mod.ML""The level of TB in prisons has been reported to be up to 100 times higher than that of the civilian population. Cases of TB in prisons may account for up to 25 per cent of a country's burden of TB. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, overcrowding, poor ventilation and repeated prison transfers encourage the transmission of TB infection. HIV infection and other pathology more common in prisons (for example, malnutrition, substance abuse) encourage the development of active disease and further transmission of infection.""High levels of MDR-TB have been reported from some prisons with up to 24 per cent of TB cases suffering from MDR forms of the disease. Factors that encourage the spread of TB in prisons also promote the spread of MDR forms.""If compared with other affected community at large, the time spent in detention center may be enough to complete the whole course of TB treatment by decreasing the rate of defaulters.For a map of the Philippines, see <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158>. - Mod.STThe news article above says that the prisoners ""were tested positive of TB"", but fails to say what type of testing was done. Presumably, these prisoners had clinical pulmonary tuberculous disease and sputum cultures grew _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular testing methods. It would be helpful to know if this was a common source outbreak, which could be confirmed by genotyping the clinical isolates to determine if any of the strains had matching genotypes. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
