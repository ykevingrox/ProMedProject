Risk Factors Associated with Blood Exposure for Sporadic Hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2017 Aug 14. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.17-0261.Abstract--------Fecal contamination of drinking water is associated with large hepatitis E virus (HEV) outbreaks of genotypes 1 and 2 in endemic areas. Sporadic transmission of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 in high-income countries has been associated with exposure to blood and animal contact. The objective of the study was to identify the risk factors for hepatitis E and the genotype(s) causing sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We selected, from a diagnostic center in Dhaka between November 2008 and November 2009, cases presenting with jaundice and anti-HEV IgM antibodies and age-matched controls were defined as those with no history of jaundice and normal blood test results. Serum samples were tested for HEV RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 109 cases and 109 controls were enrolled. The cases were more likely to be male (adjusted matched odds ratios [mOR] 2.2, 95 percent CI: 1.2-3.9; P = 0.01), or have reported contact with another person's blood or blood product, or contact with blood-contaminated sharp instruments (adjusted mOR 2.1, 95 percent CI: 1.1-4.1; P = 0.03) than controls. There were no significant differences between the cases and the controls in terms of reported high-risk sexual intercourse, consumption of undercooked meat, or contact or drinking fecally-contaminated water. The sera from 3 cases carried HEV RNA, all belonging to genotype 1. Findings from this study suggest that contact with human blood and sharing sharp instruments may transmit sporadic hepatitis E in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Efforts to prevent the transmission of blood-borne pathogens may also prevent sporadic HEV transmission in this endemic setting.--Communicated by:ProMED-SoAs<promed-SoAs@promedmail.org>[There has been increased interest, especially in Europe, of assessing the risk of HEV transmission via blood transfusion in order to assess the need for routine screening. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E is generally self-limited without a chronic phase but it is clear, especially with genotype 3 that chronic infection may occur. This is particularly true in individuals with cellular immunodeficiencies such as those who are solid organ transplant recipients and those infected with HIV. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153>.]
