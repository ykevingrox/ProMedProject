The New Indian Express [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2017/sep/14/king-george-hospital-in-andhra-pradesh-to-procure-equipment-to-ensure-error-free-anthrax-test-1656920.html>Even 2 days after the admission of 6 tribals from Dumbriguda mandal in the agency to King George Hospital with suspected anthrax symptoms, the samples collected from them are yet to be tested at the microbiology department.The diagnostic tests will be available mostly by Sunday [17 Sep 2017], said the officials. However, the officials say that equipment available at the department is not adequate to confirm cutaneous anthrax without error, for which the samples, after being tested at the microbiology department, are sent again to Manipal Medical College or the DRDE Laboratory in Gwalior for the RT-PCR test.This is the 2nd incident of suspected cutaneous anthrax being reported from the Vizag Agency. In June [2017], 5 villagers from Kodupunjuvalasa village in Araku mandal were tested positive for cutaneous anthrax. While the scientists from Gwalior are yet to visit the agency, 2 professors from the microbiology department were sent for training on anthrax testing.The culture test is done at the department, but it is a basic one to detect the disease. Hence, the department has decided to procure RT-PCR equipment, which costs IND 150 000-200 000 [USD 2300-3100] so that the confirmation tests can be done at the KGH itself. ""This will be the 1st instrument in KGH. As of now, we are getting the diagnostic reports of samples from Gwalior, which takes some weeks. Having equipment here will help conduct anthrax confirmation tests at the department. Prior to the procurement of the equipment, the professors have been sent for anthrax testing training,"" said epidemiologist L Kalyan Prasad.Microbiology department HOD P Appa Rao said plans are afoot to set up a PCR lab, which needs specially trained hands. ""As cutaneous anthrax is not fatal, the tests done at the KGH are quite enough. But for pulmonary anthrax, we need the proper equipment. The proposed lab will help us study the causal organism and gene pattern as well, which comes under the ICMR project,"" he said.Five teams from the animal husbandry department that are on a vaccination drive in 24 villages in Dumbriguda mandal in the wake of cutaneous anthrax have immunised 2420 animals so far. The drive will cover 11 000 animals. ""We haven't come across any anthrax-affected animals. We need another 2 days,"" said animal husbandry joint director Koteswara Rao.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Visakhapatnam is in northeastern Andhra Pradesh; see <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg>.

Both are near the northern border of Andhra Pradesh with Odisha Province.When I 1st started working as a veterinary epidemiologist at the MAFF CVL Weybridge in the late 1960s, we made do with glassware technology and could expect a reliable answer in a couple of days. Later, we have had plastic technology, and now it is genomics to get over their delay problem of ""some weeks."" Unless one needs the extra genetic data for forensic purposes, a simple yes/no is enough. But if the organism is dead, PCR can identify it. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/297>.]
