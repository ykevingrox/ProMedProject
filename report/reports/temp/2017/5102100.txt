Chiggers are most active during warmer summer months (<https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2000/06/got-chiggers-it-figures>). Chiggers live in shaded grassy areas and tend to be more abundant during rainy spells because they need a high-level of humidity in order to survive. During the heat of the afternoon or during long dry spells, they may retreat toward the moist soil. Once chiggers have fed on humans, they drop off of their host and transform into nymphs, which then develop into adult mites that feed on plant material and are harmless to humans.Morang District is a mostly rural southern part of Province One, in the eastern region of Nepal with a lower tropical climate (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morang_District>). Sankhuwasabha District is in the northern part of Province One, (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankhuwasabha_District>).
