Most of the suspected cases and deaths were reported from northern provinces, which are under control of Shiite Houthi rebels. The death toll has increased by 124 comparing with the last WHO report 9 days ago, while the suspected cases have risen by 62 980.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) expected the epidemic to hit one million by the end of the year [2017].The war in Yemen, which has lasted more than 2.5 years, has destroyed the bulk of the country's water and sanitation systems, with more than half of Yemen's health facilities out of service, and about 15 million people gaining no access to safe water and basic healthcare. The war has also pushed the country to the brink of famine, with an estimated 385 000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, thus putting them at heightened risk of acute watery diarrhea and cholera, according to the UN agencies.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The continuing statistics of this record epidemic of _V. cholerae_ in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2514 May / 11 000 / 18021 May / 29 300 / 31527 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5326 Jun / 96 000 / 74614 Jun / 140 116 / 98921 Jun / 179 548 / 120528 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15007 Jul / 297 438 / 170613 Jul / 332 600 / 175920 Jul / 368 207 / 182829 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199725 Aug / 565 041 / 201830 Aug / 591 100 / 20358 Sep / 635 752 / 206217 Sep / 686 783 / 209020 Sep / 704 454 / 210324 Sep / 738 212 / 211727 Sep / 753 098 / 212229 Sep / 767 524 / 2127In the last complete year of data (2015) <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries. This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only 20 weeks old and is 4.45 times the total number of global cases of 2015 and 2.25 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.3 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. As noted, there are now more cases in less than 6 months than the 1st 5+ years of the Haitian cholera disaster. As estimates here have been suggesting for some time, the total will likely break one million by 2017's end.
