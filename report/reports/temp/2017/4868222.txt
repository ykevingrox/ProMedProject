CBC News [edited]<http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-st-boniface-hospital-food-poisoning-1.4000359>More than a dozen employees of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority got food poisoning from food served at an event held at St. Boniface Hospital earlier this week.On [Tue 21 Feb 2017], 19 staff contracted food poisoning while attending an internally catered lecture for the Grand Rounds lecture series at the hospital, a WRHA spokesperson confirmed [Sun 26 Feb 2017].""Of the staff that became ill, 1 required intravenous fluids due to dehydration,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email. ""The incidents of food poisoning were confined to the Grand Rounds event."" She said that the culprit was likely sandwiches. No other food served at the hospital was impacted, she said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Knowing the incubation period from when the food was ingested to the beginning of symptoms, whether vomiting or diarrhea was more prominent, whether fever is associated with the illness and how long the illness lasted can help to suspect a particular cause.Although a small outbreak, it is a poetic one as it occurred in a healthcare setting for Grand Rounds. I have a classical Grand Rounds in which I supply a pretty fancy menu and we talk about all the potential causes of foodborne illnesses hidden within but we do not serve the food!! - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/261>.]
