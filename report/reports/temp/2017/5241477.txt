Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Poliovirus Weekly Update as of: 9 Aug 2017, World Health Organization-----------------------------New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 8Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37 New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 37Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5Headlines- The United Kingdom has announced 100 million in new funding to polio eradication to meet the final challenges. - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: 2 positive environmental samples of wild poliovirus type 1 in Pakistan and 1 in Afghanistan; 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in Syria and 3 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Details in country-specific sections below.  Afghanistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains five. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [19 Jun 2017] from Kandahar.  One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on [7 Jul 2017] from Lashkargah in Helmand province.- Preparations are continuing for the next round of the National Immunization Days starting on [14 Aug 2017]. There is special focus on ensuring high quality vaccination drive in the southern region of the country.Pakistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week; the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains three. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [11 Jun 2017], from Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.- Two new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, the most recent collected on [19 Jul 2017], from Karachi in Sindh.- A special vaccination round is being implemented during August 2017 targeting areas with recent polio cases and positive environmental samples. These include Rawalpindi / Islamabad and demographically connected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Quetta Block and parts of Karachi.- Under the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication, the country is planning to implement 2 nation-wide and 2 sub-national vaccination rounds from September to December 2017.Nigeria- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.  The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017.  The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno. - Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).  - Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.  Central Africa- Three new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). This brings the total number of cases this year to 7, in 2 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2: in Haut Lomami province (5 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on [13 Jun 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [2 May 2017]). - Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces. - The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on [27-29 Jun 2017] in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from [13-15 Jul 2017] in Haut Lomami and [20-22 Jul 2017] in Maniema.- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.    Middle East- In Syria, 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were officially confirmed at WHO headquarters in the past week, bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 30. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between [3 Mar 2017 and 16 Jun 2017]. 29 of the cases are from Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zour governorate, and 1 case is from Talabyad district, Raqqa governorate.- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.  Two vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir Ez-Zour and Raqqa governorates. If there is geographic spread, the extent of these campaigns will have to be adjusted.- The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir Ez-Zour was successfully carried out between [22-26 Jul 2017]. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall). The 2nd round is planned for [19-23 Aug 2017], and will include mOPV2 and IPV.- Raqqa Governorate plans to start mOPV2 campaigns on [12 Aug 2017].- Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey and Lebanon.

Both are areas that have had transmission identified from earlier this year (2017).  In the case of Syria, it appears that the transmission of the cVDPV has been localized to the Deir al Zour governorate with a single case having been reported from the neighboring Raqqah governorate (suggesting this may have been an isolated importation). To date there have been 30 cases of polio attributable to the cVDPV in Syria.  In the case of the DR Congo, while cases had been identified in 2 provinces, it appears that circulation has continued in only one of the 2 provinces - Haut Lomami province.  As the dates of onset of most recent confirmed cases in both Syria and the DR Congo are in mid-June, and control vaccination campaigns were begun in mid-July (in Syria) and late June and mid July (in the 2 affected provinces in the DR Congo), and  we are now in early August, it would not be surprising to learn of additional cases over the coming weeks that were infected before the immunization campaigns were completed..Also noteworthy in the above update is the identification of 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples in Karachi, Sindh Pakistan.  The most recent reported (and confirmed)  case of polio due to WPV1 in Sindh was in 2016. (<http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces>).  So the identification of the WPV1 in environmental samples is of concern as it indicates an infected individual(s) has been in the area and might be a source for continued tranmission of the WPV1.The HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at:Syria: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/86>   DR Congo: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194>A map of Syria showing governorates can be found at: <https://www.mapsofworld.com/syria/maps/syria-political-map.jpg>, (Deir al Zour is Dayr az Zaw), located near the border with Iraq..
