Of that number -- totaling about 48 million people -- 128 000 are hospitalized and 3000 people die. Symptoms of foodborne disease typically include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, according to the Virginia Department of Health. Additional symptoms may include fever, headache, malaise, muscle ache, loss of appetite, weight loss, chills and dehydration.[Byline: Carol Vaughn]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The etiology of the illness and the number of cases involved is not entirely clear but salmonellosis needs to be close to the top of the list given the anecdotal report on Facebook of a case that identified _Salmonella_ and _E. coli_. Most _E. coli_ pathotypes causing diarrhea, other than enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, are relatively mild. ProMED would like more information about clinical symptoms and culture results about the outbreak as well as the number of cases.Chincoteague is, speaking from personal experience spending time there with children and grandchildren, a magical place with great beaches and wonderful food - much of it fresh out of the ocean moments before - in restaurants and food trucks. The area is home to hundreds of wild ponies that have lived on the salt flats. Legend has it that the feral ponies are descendants of survivors of a Spanish galleon that sank on its way to Spain during a storm in 1750 off the east coast, but the likelihood is that they are actually descended from domesticated stock, brought to the island by Eastern Shore farmers in the 17th century to avoid fencing requirements and taxation. Because of their diet, the equines do not grow tall enough to be a true horse, hence the term pony. The main distinction between ponies and horses is height. A horse is usually considered to be an equine that is at least 14.2 hands (or about 4 feet, 10 inches) tall. A pony, on the other hand (pun totally intended!), is an equine less than 14.2 hands. The ponies wander the area, often to be seen on the public beaches.The town is known for these Chincoteague Ponies, although these are not actually on the island of Chincoteague but on nearby Assateague Island. These ponies and the annual Pony Penning Day are the subject of Marguerite Henry's 1947 children's book Misty of Chincoteague, which was made into the 1961 family film Misty, filmed on location.The so-called Delmarva peninsula off of which Chincoteague and Assateague Islands are found contain Delaware and parts of Maryland and Virginia and can be found on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmarva_Peninsula>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/247>, <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19038>.]
