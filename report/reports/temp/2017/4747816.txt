FiOS1 News [edited]<http://www.fios1news.com/longisland/legionella-at-garden-city-park-la-fitness-pool#.WG9PQrlGTro>According to officials with the Nassau County Department of Health [New York State], at least 2 people who attend LA Fitness in Garden City Park have come down with legionnaire's disease.The fitness facility's pool has been drained and has been closed since [30 Dec 2016] after the Nassau County Department of Health found the bacterium that causes legionnaire's disease.Patients typically experience flu-like symptoms and could develop pneumonia; one out of 3 people who are sick with legionnaires' [disease] will wind up in the hospital. The dangerous bacterium was found in the pool and the spa, an environment where the disease-[causing organisms] could thrive, according to health department spokesperson Mary Ellen Laurain. ""It's not contracted from person to person. It's from the _Legionella_ bacterium, which is found in water,"" Laurain explained.According to an employee at LA Fitness, the pool will be cleaned over the weekend [7-8 Jan 2017] and is expected to be reopened by next [Fri 13 Jan 2017]. LA Fitness members who have used the facility in November or December [2016] and develop flu-like symptoms should see a doctor right away and get tested for Legionnaire's disease.[Byline: Kevin Vesey]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his contribution.A spa pool (a.k.a hot tub or whirlpool spa), operated in homes or commercial facilities, can be a source for legionellosis. ProMED-mail has posted several outbreaks of legionnaires' disease traced back to a hot tub (see also's below)._Legionella_ are commonly found in natural waters, such as lakes and rivers, usually in low bacterial densities, but can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of pipes and tanks of artificial water systems such as domestic plumbing (taps, showers, etc), ornamental fountains and spa pools, where _Legionella_ multiply to high densities and contaminate the water supply. The water temperature in hot tubs is kept between 30 to 40 C [86-104 F], the optimum temperature for _Legionella_ to grow. (At temperatures below 20 C [68 F], the bacteria are dormant, and at temperatures above 60 C [140 F], _Legionella_ are killed over time.)The hot tub has a circulator pump to ensure the water flows around the occupants. Aerosols of _Legionella_ are apparently formed when the circulator vigorously agitates the water. People can inhale these infectious aerosols. Exposing the lungs to the bacteria can then lead, in susceptible people, to legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the disease or Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form.People can be exposed to these aerosols not only while using a hot tub, but also by being close enough to breathe in the fine spray created, such as, by observing a demonstration of a hot tub, as apparently occurred in the Stoke-on-Trent (England) outbreak in which 19 cases were confirmed as legionnaires' disease (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK (13): (England) fatal, hot tub 20120816.1246273). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57543>.]
