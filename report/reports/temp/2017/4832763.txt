Seligman, MD <sseligman@rockefeller,edu> [edited]A recent ProMED posting has discussed cases of yellow fever in Brazil where the vast majority of the cases are occurring: in Brazil's 2nd most populous state, Minas Gerais, (ProMED posting published Date: 2017-02-08 15:41:00 Subject: PRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Americas (16): Brazil Archive Number: 20170208.4824819). The distribution of cases in that state is found in an [Wed 8 Feb 2017] report from the Minas Gerais Health Department. Confirmed cases have occurred in 4 widely dispersed counties and suspect cases are being investigated in many additional regions. A total 85 percent of the cases and 88 percent of the deaths occurred in males suggesting that infection is occurring predominantly in men working in jungle areas. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that none of the cases occurred in children younger than 10 years of age. Up to 96 percent of the infections occurred in people without a history of vaccination, an observationconfirming the incompleteness of vaccination in Minas Gerais in recent years.Of additional concern is the unusually large number of fatal cases in monkeys (ProMED posting, published Date: 2017-02-08 20:29:33Subject: PRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Americas (17): Brazil, monkeys Archive Number: 20170208.4825553). This suggests that current environmental conditions are particularly conducive to the propagation of mosquitoes such as _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ species,the usual vectors of jungle yellow fever in the Western Hemisphere. Although of considerable concern, urban yellow fever in which virus is spread by _Aedes aegypti_, a mosquito adapted to urban environments, has not been documented.Since methods to prevent spread through diminishing the species propagating jungle yellow fever have not been developed, control of that entity is dependent on vaccination. The above report from the Minas Gerais Health Department documents that sufficient vaccine is available and is being distributed. However, an article that funds for scientific work are insufficient to maintain salaries (Escobar, H. (2017). ""Brazil's 'doomsday' scenario."" Science 355(6323): 334) coupled with an inflation rate of approximately 10 percent may create additional complexities.The abundance of fatal cases in monkeys coupled with widespread occurrence of yellow fever in humans in a region with a scant history of vaccination has led to a near-perfect storm for the dissemination of jungle yellow fever. Hopefully, extensive vaccination will limit the rural epidemic and prevent the spread to cities resulting in urban yellow fever.--Communicated by:Stephen J. Seligman, MDAdjunct ProfessorThe Rockefeller UniversityNew York, NY<sseligman@rockefeller,edu>[Dr. Seligman is thanked for his comments. He touches on a key point -- the risk of cases resulting from the sylvan (jungle or forest) cycle of transmission to an urban cycle with transmission by _Aedes aegypti_, which is abundant in cities and towns in Brazil. Fortunately, supplies of vaccine are reported to be adequate for the campaigns that are underway.Maps of Brazil can be seen at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.][See Also:uYellow fever - Americas (18): PAHO/WHO 20170209.4828737Yellow fever - Americas (17): Brazil, monkeys 20170208.4825553Yellow fever - Americas (16): Brazil 20170208.4824819Yellow fever - Americas (15): Brazil, WHO 20170204.4815997Yellow fever - Americas (14): Brazil, CDC Advisory 20170202.4811829Yellow fever - Americas (13): Brazil (MG) 20170202.4809356Yellow fever - Americas (12): Brazil, human, monkey 20170201.4806487Yellow fever - Americas (11): Brazil (MG) link to deforestation susp. 20170131.4805198Yellow fever - Americas (10): Brazil 20170129.4801425Yellow fever - Americas (09): Brazil 20170126.4794564Yellow fever - Americas (08): Brazil (MG, ES) 20170123.4786224Yellow fever - Americas (07): Brazil, PAHO/WHO 20170121.4782152Yellow fever - Americas (06): Brazil (MG,ES) 20170119.4776143Yellow fever - Americas (05): Brazil (MG) 20170118.4773082Yellow fever - Americas (04): Brazil (MG) 20170114.4766222Yellow fever - Americas (03): Brazil (MG) 20170114.4764991Yellow fever - Americas (02): Brazil (MG, SP) 20170112.4761705Yellow fever - Americas (01): PAHO/WHO 2016 20170110.4753504].................................................dk/ty/ec/dk"
