Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/nigeria-hepatitis-e-borno-state-cholera-kwara-state-84944/>A hepatitis E outbreak has been reported in the north-east Borno State, according to the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health. As of 17 Jun 2017, a total of 53 suspected hepatitis E cases with no fatality have been reported from Damasak and Ngala Local Government Areas (LGA). At least 3 pregnant women were among these cases. Four out of 9 biological samples obtained from the initial cases tested positive for hepatitis E virus at a virology laboratory in Lagos, thus confirming the outbreak.The current hepatitis E outbreak in the north-east Borno State of Nigeria is taking place within the context of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the northern part of the country. The outbreak is occurring in the aftermath of increasing population movements within the Lake Chad basin, following the gradually improving security situation. The Diffa region in Niger and the Salamat region in Chad have ongoing outbreaks of hepatitis E.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Much of the mortality in hepatitis E occurs in women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.The following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N and Koren G: Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015; 6(7)1: 607-608; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501603/>.""Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).""Hepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 percent to 25 percent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 percent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 percent to 50 percent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within 1 week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19).""References----------6.
