Official sources said here that among [3] deceased children one each was from Deoria, Gorakhpur and Ambedkar Nagar districts. Sources said that 1045 patients of encephalitis were admitted in BRD medical college since last 1 January [2017]; 223 of them have died till date. A total of 18 new patients were admitted in hospital today [Fri 15 Sep 2017] while 121 patients were getting treatment. Patients of Gorakhpur, 7 districts of Basti region, Azamgarh, Ballia, Gonda, Mau, Ghazipur, Balrampur, Bihar and neighbouring country Nepal, get treatment here in the BRD medical college.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The Gorakhpur district, and eastern Uttar Pradesh state generally, have been localities of many cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in recent years. However, there is no indication if any of the 3 recent cases or of the 233 fatal cases to date mentioned above are due to JE or are AES cases. A previous report stated that 15-18 children continue to die every day at the 950-bed Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College and Hospital; a 3rd of these deaths are due to encephalitis. A total of 97 of the 1527 child deaths between 1 Jul-14 Aug 2017 were from the mosquito borne JE and AES. ProMED would be interested in receiving more details about the etiologies of the cases in the above report.The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. With the likelihood of multiple etiologies, a long-term and well integrated study will be required to determine the causes of AES.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142>. - Mod.TY]
