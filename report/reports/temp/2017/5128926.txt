Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, and Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO, say that ""more than 1300 people have died -- one quarter of them children -- and the death toll is expected to rise.""That's because they suspect Yemen now has upwards of 200 000 cases to grapple with, and that number is only growing quickly -- by a rate of roughly 5000 cases a day. ""And geographically it is expanding,"" Mohamed El Montassir Hussein, Yemen director for the International Rescue Committee, told NPR's Jason Beaubien earlier this month [June 2017]. ""It's not a small area. It's almost the whole country.""Hussein added: ""There is nowhere in the country you can say this place is better than another,"" says Hussein. ""Every family is suffering from something whether it's cholera or lack of food, having child soldiers in the family or having someone go join the rebels or the military. There's been a whole collapse of the social life.""After more than 2 years of civil war, Yemen's health care system is at risk of ""complete collapse,"" a UNICEF spokesman told Jason.The country has been roiled by violence since Houthi rebels seized power and ousted the president, who fled to sanctuary in neighboring Saudi Arabia. Since then, a Saudi-led coalition supported by the USA has waged a protracted campaign against the rebels -- and some worry that support makes the USA complicit in Yemen's deepening humanitarian crisis.""There's an American imprint on every civilian death inside Yemen that's caused by the Saudi bombing campaign,"" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told NPR's Michele Kelemen in May 2017 after the USA signed a new arms deal with Saudi Arabia. ""The Saudis simply could not operate this bombing campaign without us,"" he continued. ""Their planes can't fly without USA refueling capacity. They are dropping munitions that we've sold them. We are standing side by side with them often when they are reviewing intelligence about targets.""Saudi Arabia's new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman -- who, as NPR's Deborah Amos reports, is said to have been ""the prime mover in the kingdom's decision to go to war in Yemen"" -- recently authorized a USD 66 million donation to support UNICEF and WHO's anti-cholera efforts there. ""We look forward to discussing this contribution with the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre,"" UNICEF responded in a statement [Fri 23 Jun 2017]. ""Such generosity will make a great difference to thousands of children at risk of contracting this rapidly spreading disease.""Lake and Chan made clear [Sat 24 Jun 2017], just how rapid it's spreading -- and, in turn, just how rapid the response needs to be.""We are working around the clock to detect and track the spread of disease and to reach people with clean water, adequate sanitation and medical treatment. Rapid response teams are going house-to-house to reach families with information about how to protect themselves by cleaning and storing drinking water,"" they said.""We call on authorities in Yemen to strengthen their internal efforts to stop the outbreak from spreading further.""[Byline: Colin Dwyer]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the dreadfully impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 53202 Jun / 73 700 / 60504 Jun / 86 400 / 67605 Jun / 91 400 / 72806 Jun / 96 000 / 74607 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 1310To be consistent with past posts, the date is the day prior to the specific posting but, as this one, may not reflect the data point day.
