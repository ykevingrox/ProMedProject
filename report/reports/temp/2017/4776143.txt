The new total announced by the state Secretariat of Health (Secretaria de Estado de SaÌ¼de de Minas Gerais (SES-MG)) this [Tue 17 Jan 2017] shows an increase of 13 per cent in the number of deaths in relation to the bulletin issued on [Mon 16 Jan 2017]. Now, there are investigations of 53 deaths, with a total of 22 laboratory tests giving a preliminary diagnosis of the disease.The number of suspected cases also increased, from 152 on [Mon 16 Jan 2017] to 184 [these are cases with the beginning of symptoms on what date? Are the reports late? - Mod.RNA]. According to SES-MG, of these cases suspected to have the disease, 37 patients had laboratory tests that gave a yellow fever preliminary diagnosis. However, they still have to have an epidemiological investigation, history of vaccination and movements of these patients, to confirm that they really have contracted the disease.The majority of the patients that have a preliminary result of confirmed tests for the disease are from Ladainha, in the Vale do Mucuri, which has 8 probable [YF] deaths. According to the city government, 16 residents have died with symptoms of the disease. There are also preliminarily confirmed deaths in Piedade de Caratinga (4 deaths), Ipanema (2), Malacacheta (2), ImbÌ© de Minas (1), Ubaporanga (1), Sao Sebastiao do Maranhao (1), Itambacuri (1), PotÌ© (1) and Setubinha (1).The SES-MG has asked the Ministry of Health to send 2 000 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine. Of this number, it is expected that 500 000 doses will arrive in the state on [Fri 20 Jan 2017]. According to the office, they will be sent to the health regions gradually. As of this [Mon 16 Jan 2017], the state received 957 000 doses of the vaccine against the disease. Another 450 000 doses will arrive in the state this [Tue 17 Jan 2017].--communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[In addition to the increase in the number of suspected cases and deaths and the number of municipalities with possible transmission, there are other concerns: slowness to confirm (or rule out) the diagnosis, risk (and the ability of the surveillance system to detect) (neurotropic and viscerotropic disease) and, above all, the ability to meet the demand for the number of doses of vaccine for routine and blocking actions (what is the strategic stock?). - Mod. RNA, in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY.Given the rapid increase in suspected cases, a major concern is if these are all sylvan (forest) cases as previously reported, or if some cases involving _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission have occurred as well. The vaccination campaign is urgent to prevent urban spread of the disease, which could get out of hand quickly.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4517>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Espirito SantoDate: Tue 17 Jan 2016, 4:48 PMSource: Globo.com [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://g1.globo.com/espirito-santo/noticia/2017/01/febre-amarela-numero-de-casos-suspeitos-sobe-para-quatro-no-es.html>The state Secretariat of Health (Secretaria de Estado da SaÌ¼de do EspÌ rito Santo; SESA) reported on [Tue 17 Jan 2017] afternoon that the number of people suspected of having yellow fever in Espirito Santo has increased to 4. In addition to this, SESA said that the number of doses of [YF] vaccine will increase to 500 000 that will be delivered to the state this [Fri 20 Jan 2017].SESA related that Espirito Santo does not have areas considered to be at risk [for YF], and so those who are going to travel to areas that have had the disease outside of the state must be vaccinated.Each of the 4 patients who are suspected of having the disease are from the interior of the state and are hospitalized in Grande Vitoria, according to SESA. The cases are still under investigation and are not confirmed. The Secretariat says that they are not going to reveal the localities where the suspected cases are emerging in order to not alarm the population.The updated number of dead monkeys suspected of having the disease was also not reported. The last registered number was 80 dead animals. They are undergoing testing and the results will be known in 20 days.This past [Tue 17 Jan 2017], there was a lot of the yellow fever vaccine procured for Espirito Santo. In order to meet the population's demand, 500 000 doses will be delivered to the state on [Fri 20 Jan 2017]. The 350 000 doses reported previously by SESA will arrive this [Wed 18 Jan 2017]. The other 150 000 doses will arrive this weekend [apparently making the 500 000 doses allocated].The vaccine will be distributed mainly to 26 municipalities, 3 more than was reported previously, but can also serve as reinforcement at other cities.A man who lived in Lajinha, Minas Gerais, was attended in the emergency services in Muniz Freire, in the south of Espirito Santo on [Mon 16 Jan 2017], with symptoms of yellow fever. He is in isolation and will have tests done this afternoon [Tue 17 Jan 2017]. The municipal secretary of health, Juliana Louzada, says that this 41 year old man traveled to the state due to fear of the disease in Minas Gerais. He was treated for diarrhea, body aches and vomiting, but will have tests, since these symptoms are common with other diseases, such as dengue, for example.A resident of Sao Roque do Canaa in the north west of the state, a 37 year old housewife, has been in hospital since [Sat 14 Jan 2017] in the Hospital Sao Lucas, in VitÌ ria, with suspected yellow fever. According to the secretary of health in Sao Roque do Canaa, Orlei Amaral Cardoso, the woman, who lived in the Sao Francisco community in the Santa JÌ¼lia district, went to the emergency room in the city on [Sat 7 Jan 2017] with headache, nausea and abdominal pain, and was released after being medical treatment. On the following day, she returned to the health unit with the same symptoms and after laboratory tests, nothing was found and she was again medicated and released. After consulting, her husband took the woman in the family vehicle and she entered the emergency unit in Serra. ""From there, she was taken to the Praia do Canto Hospital, where it was verified that the patient needed hemodialysis. After her health picture grew worse, she was transferred to the Sao Lucas hospital in serious condition,"" the secretary said. Orlei Cardoso stated that [mosquito] traps will be placed on the property where the family lives. ""We will place 6 traps in order to monitor for 3 consecutive days in the area. Our objective is to identify the species of mosquitoes that are circulating in the region. The analysis will be done by the Entomology Nucleus of the state Secretariat of Health (SESA),"" he said.The secretary of health stated that the vaccine against yellow fever will be distributed in the health units in Sao Roque do Canaa. ""The demand for the vaccine is big, but the population does not need to be alarmed because we will make available the doses in the 4 health units of the city,"" he concluded.A retired man, 67, is the woman's neighbor and is worried about the situation in the region. ""We have a lot of howler monkeys here [important hosts of YF virus. - Mod. TY] and we have become afraid. My father says that they had yellow fever cases in the region 58 years ago. I am waiting to receive the vaccination with my family,"" he stated.A farmer, 45, who lives in ConceiÌ¤ao do Castelo, in the Serrana region, was transferred on [Mon 16 Jan 2017] to the Evangelical Hospital in Vila Velha. He is also suspected of having yellow fever and has been in hospital at the Nossa Senhora da Penha Hospital, which is in the municipality, since last [Thu 12 Jan 2017]. A resident of Mata Fria, in the rural area of the city, he has so far presented with symptoms that are also common to dengue, such as fever, body aches and headaches. The suspected yellow fever [diagnosis] came after dead monkeys were found in the area where he lives. Prior to the transfer, Nossa Senhora da Penha Hospital reported that the patient had a low blood platelet count, jaundice and progressed to a liver injury.--communicated by:ProMED-PORT<promed-port@promedmail.org>[The occurrence of dead monkeys is a good indication that sylvan (forest) yellow fever virus is circulating in the area. Prompt vaccination under these circumstances is wise. The suspected YF case who came to the state from Minas Gerais where yellow fever cases are occurring illustrates the risk that potentially viremic individuals have to move the virus from one locality to another. In case these individuals end up in a place where there are abundant _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes and unvaccinated people, an urban cycle of transmission could be initiated. - Mod.
