Both the manufacturer and the IBTS have confirmed the assay has a limit of detection for HBV of the order of 4 IU/mL. In addition, in terms of screening for HBV markers we test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen.For clarification purposes, the transmission of HBV in this case was due to a donation obtained in the pre-ID NAT window period, when the level of HBV DNA in the donor's blood was below the limit of detection of even this extremely sensitive assay. The window period for the UE assay is of the order of just 15 days. The IBTS introduced ID NAT testing in 2009, in order to avail of this shorter window period and hence earliest possible detection of HBV infection. As mentioned in your comments, the serological window period is significantly longer.A full investigation has been conducted into this case. During this investigation it was demonstrated that the assay performed within the expected level of sensitivity. In addition, the investigation demonstrated that all aspects of laboratory testing and donor screening were satisfactory. The IBTS will continue to employ the most advanced technologies and safest screening strategy available to maintain the safety of the blood supplied to the people of Ireland.--Dr. Niamh O'FlahertyConsultant MicrobiologistIrish Blood Transfusion Service<Niamh.O'Flaherty@ibts.ie>[ProMED thanks Dr. O'Flaherty for the quick response. It seems that the ""serological window period"" when HBsAg disappears and anti-HBs has not appeared yet is not the issue here but rather the blood was transfused prior to the HBsAg becoming positive and anti-HBc has yet to be positive. Anti-HBc would be positive in the ""serological window"".Although the Irish press has been somewhat reactive regarding this quite rare episode, clearly the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is not at fault at all here. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39>.][See Also:Hepatitis B - Ireland (02): post-transfusion, seronegative blood, comment 20170830.5285519Hepatitis B - Ireland: post-transfusion, seronegative blood 20170830.5284369Hepatitis B - Australia: (NS) 20170705.5152458Hepatitis B & C - USA (02): (VA) injection drug use 20170629.5140622Hepatitis B & C - USA: (NC) injection drug use 20170619.5115801Hepatitis B & C - Pakistan: (Sindh) 20170503.5009439Hepatitis B & C - global: WHO update 20170421.4985250Hepatitis B - China: (SD) hemodialysis unit 20170210.48306722016----Hepatitis B - Kenya: (TU) prison 20161215.4700896Hepatitis B - Uganda (03): (SE) 20161116.4628116Hepatitis B - USA (08): reactivation during hepatitis C therapy 20161007.4543334Hepatitis B - Uganda (02) 20160911.4480806Hepatitis B - USA (07) :(ME) injection drug use 20160907.4469090Hepatitis B & C - USA (02): (WV) cardiac tests, expanded numbers, RFI 20160619.4296498Hepatitis B - USA (06): (ME) injection drug use 20160615.4289817Hepatitis B & C - USA: (WV) cardiac tests 20160329.4126017Hepatitis B - USA (05): (NC) injection drug use, 2015, comment 20160303.4066823Hepatitis B - USA (04): (NC) injection drug use, 2015 20160303.4063893Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874Hepatitis B - USA (03): injection drug use, comment 20160211.4012860Hepatitis B - USA (02): injection drug use, comment 20160206.3999152Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234Hepatitis B - USA: (KY, WV, TN) injection drug use 20160130.3980173].................................................ll/ao/dk"
