For now, the Medical Legal Institute has not stated conclusively in respect to the presence of the virus.[To establish] the reason for the death of the man, a corporal 2nd class of the carabineros, the institution followed all the established protocols to determine whether the official could have become infected by [a] hantavirus in the School for NCOs, located in the Macui community.The [clinical] diagnosis for the official was severe respiratory insufficiency, which is why he was kept in the intensive care unit of the Carabineros Hospital until he died. Afterward, his body was sent to the Medical Legal Institute, where no information related to the virus was given despite the tests carried out.On the part of the institution [School], Captain Jorge ZuÌ±iga stated that they are awaiting the results from the Public Health Institute to confirm whether the cause of death was due to influenza or a hantavirus.The Carabineros of Chile, moreover, stated that up to now, there are no other officials who have presented with symptoms of a possible virus infection. It was also stated that it is not certain that the School for NCOs is being evacuated due to this possible hantavirus outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The occurrence of rapidly progressive, fatal pulmonary insufficiency in an otherwise healthy adult certainly is suggestive of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). In Chile, HPS is caused by Andes virus, which is endemic in Chile. As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the Metro Santiago region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus.The report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the man might have acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13321>. - Mod.TY]
