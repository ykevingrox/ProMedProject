WFTV [edited]<http://www.wftv.com/news/local/2-cases-of-legionnaires-disease-linked-to-hot-tub-at-clermont-retirement-community/533033573>The Florida Health Department tracked 2 cases of legionnaires' disease to a hot tub at a Clermont [Lake County] retirement community. Health investigators are trying to determine if the disease is to blame for the death of a 3rd person.Recently, 2 people at Summit Greens in Clermont tested positive the disease. The cases come on the heels of an unrelated investigation in Orange County where 4 people contracted the disease at 2 LA Fitness gyms.Authorities said the community hot tub at Summit Greens was the source of the bacteria found in the new cases.The hot tub has since been disinfected, but health department officials said people may not be out of the woods yet. They will continue to monitor people here over the next couple of weeks.According to the health department, the 1st case of legionnaires' disease was diagnosed [25 May 2017]. The next day, another person was diagnosed with the _Legionella_ bacteria. Both were residents of the Summit Greens community.After an investigation, authorities narrowed the search down to the hot tub at the clubhouse. The hot tub was closed down [6 Jun 2017].""So we are currently working on a 2-to 14-day incubation period. We are urging residents that pretty much from the last day they used the hot tub, they can develop symptoms anywhere from 2 to 14 days after exposure,"" said Giselle Barreto, a government operations consultant with the Florida Department of Health in Lake County.A 3rd individual who showed signs of legionnaires' disease later died, but his tests for the disease were negative. ""We have pursued further testing by having a culture sent to the CDC to ensure that it wasn't one of those other possible types,"" said Barreto.The 2 patients have been treated and released from the hospital.[Byline: Jeff Levkulich]--Communicated by:Denis Green<legion@q-net.net.au>[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his submission.A hot tub is said to be the source for at least 2 cases of legionnaires' disease at the Summit Greens community in Clermont, Florida, but we are not told in the news report above on what this association was based.
