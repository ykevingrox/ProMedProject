Benin WEB TV [in French, machine trans, edited]<https://beninwebtv.com/2017/01/panique-a-malanville-alassane-seibou-rassure-depidemie-de-meningite/>The deaths of 4 schoolchildren from Madecali Center in the commune of Malanville [Alibori department] in December [2016] and beginning of the current year [2017] as a result of brutal headache without fever and followed by a brutal death the same day has been the subject of various interpretations. For many people, these deaths were due to a meningitis epidemic. Assertion [was] fed [by] social networks throughout the week.But through a press statement made in his office on [Thu 12 Jan 2017], the Minister of Health, Alassane SÌ©ibou, wanted to reassure the population. ""We are not in a situation of meningococcal meningitis epidemic ... Benin is not in an epidemic situation"" said the minister to say that there was more fear than evil.According to Minister Alassane SÌ©ibou, the teams in the health zone ""undertook systematic examinations of children and to date 22 children with similar signs of headache, fever have been identified and put [under] observation at the Malanville area hospital for care and follow-up."" At the end of the analyses according to the explanations provided by the Minister of Health, ""On the samples taken, the presence of Gram-positive diplococcus was obtained in a single child. The other samples are negative,"" said the minister before concluding that the results obtained so far exclude the hypothesis of ""an epidemic of meningococcal meningitis.""However, the joint teams of the Ministry of Health of the departments of Borgou, Alibori, and the health zone of Malanville are working on the ground for further investigations.[Byline: Edouard Djogbenou]--Communicated by:Roland HÌ bnerSuperior Health CouncilBrusselsBelgium<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>[ProMED-mail thanks Roland HÌ bner for the submission above that concerns an outbreak in Malanville, a city, arrondissement, and commune, with a population of 168 006 residents, in the Alibori Department of northeastern Benin (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malanville>). The illness was fatal in 4 children and was initially suspected to be bacterial meningitis, but a ""systematic investigation"" that may have included examination of cerebrospinal fluid in 22 children was ""negative"" in all but one patient, in whom the ""sample"" revealed ""Gram-positive diplococci"", which presumably is _Streptococcus pneumoniae_.  There is some confusion in the discription of the children's illness in the news report above; the 4 children who died had ""headache, without fever"", but the other 22 ill children were said to have ""similar signs of headache, fever"". More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.Diagnoses in the other patients are not stated in the news report above, but Roland HÌ bner also submitted an article that was recently (in February 2017) published in the Lancet (<http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(16)30287-X.pdf>), which concerned an outbreak of suspected meningitis in the Democratic Republic of Congo in December 2014. Meningitis was initially suspected by health workers because of neck muscle spasm, but only 4 of 83 patients who underwent lumbar puncture had cerebrospinal fluid evidence of meningococcal meningitis. The outbreak was attributed to a dystonic reaction secondary to haloperidol, which patients had mistakenly taken when consuming tablets labeled fraudulently as diazepam, but which in fact contained undeclared haloperidol.Dystonic reactions are characterized by intermittent spasmodic or sustained involuntary contractions of muscles in the face, neck, trunk, pelvis, or extremities that can result in stiff neck, tongue protrusion, lockjaw, facial grimacing, or eye deviation, most often associated with use of antiemetics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814632-clinical>). These reactions are more common in children and young adults. Dystonic reactions are treated with benztropine (Cogentin) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Diazepam may also be useful, but diazepam has been found rarely to cause an acute dystonic reaction (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3065401>).A drug-related dystonic reaction maybe the cause of the outbreak in Benin; its diagnosis will require a thorough history of drug use. Substandard and falsified medicines pose a serious threat to public health worldwide, but are especially a problem in developing countries (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/28/2/443.full>, <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4137817/>, and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK202527/>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41803>.]
