All were seen at 28 to 35 days after exposure. By then a raised eosinophil count was seen in less than 30 percent. Egg detection in feces and urine were negative, and the schistosome antibody test was positive in only one sample.However, a PCR test targeting the Dra-1 tandem repeat sequence of the _Schistosoma haematobium_ genome was positive in all serum samples from 5 patients with a raised eosinophil count examined so far. Further analyses are pending.Schistosomiasis was not reported previously from this area, and a malacological [study of mollusks] survey will soon be conducted.--Emmanuel Bottieau<EBottieau@itg.be>Jan Clerinx<jclerinx@itg.be>Institute of Tropical MedicineAntwerpBelgiumPatricia Schlagenhauf<patricia.schlagenhauf@uzh.ch>David Hamer<dhamer@bu.edu> on behalf of GeoSentinel<http://www.istm.org/geosentinel>[ProMED thanks Emmanuel Bottieau, Joannes Clerinx and GeoSentinel for reporting this outbreak. It is well known that a measurable antibody test may take several months to develop and we presume that all will be followed and serology collected later.The use of PCR for diagnosing early with _Schistosoma_ spp. is interesting but needs follow up with serology or detection of eggs to be confirmed. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3709>.][See Also:2003----Schistosomiasis - South Africa: RFI: 20030916.23492001----Schistosomiasis - Swaziland (Shiselweni) 20010317.0537].................................................ep/mj/mpp"
