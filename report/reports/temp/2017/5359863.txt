Daily Monitor [edited]<http://goo.gl/iczGSf>A cholera outbreak that hit Kasese district last week [week of 25 Sep 2017] has so far claimed 3 lives with more than 80 admitted, medics say. Dr Alphose Gatare, the Bwera general hospital medical superintendent says the 3 died on Sun 1 Oct 2017. ""Yesterday [1 Oct 2017] we lost 3 people. 2 died on arrival and the other one had already been put on treatment. It is unfortunate that we lost them after reaching hospital,"" Dr Gatare said. He says those who died were brought to the hospital after being dehydrated something that made it difficult for the doctors to find the veins to apply medication. The most affected villages are Katholhu in Nyakiyumbu sub county and Bunyiswa in Bwera sub county, about 10 km [6.2 mi] from the hospital.Dr Gatare says the hospital has been struggling with supplies because they had not yet received cholera drugs from the National Medical Stores [NMS]. Bwera hospital which is about 5 km [3.1 mi] from the border with Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] has been relying on supplies from Kagando hospital in Kisinga sub county, the doctor revealed. ""We have asked NMS to send supplies immediately because it may not be easy for us if more are admitted. Kagando hospital and Medecins Sans Frontieres have been assisting us in the past week,"" Dr Gatare said.Cholera has been persistent in sub counties bordering DRC with an outbreak at least every year. Sometimes, the epidemic spreads across the border forcing an influx of patients from the DRC to Bwera hospital.[Byline: Misairi Thembo Kahungu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Kasese District is a district in southwestern Uganda and its location can be seen on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasese_District>.

The 16 displaced people died from cholera in the period between Saturday until Sunday, 30 Sep 2017-1 Oct 2017.Red Sea-------In Red Sea state in eastern Sudan, a young girl died from what was suspected to be cholera in Sinkat Hospital on Monday morning, 2 Oct 2017, a source informed this station. The medical director of the hospital, however, reported that they received cases of normal diarrhoea. Dr Mohamed Ali further told Radio Dabanga that laboratory examination and the symptoms patients show did not point to cases of watery diarrhea or cholera. ""These are cases of diarrhea that may be caused by food, water, or environmental pollution.""Sudan's 1st cases of cholera were recorded in Blue Nile state in August 2016. Since then, the disease spread in eastern Sudan, and later to the Northern State and central Sudan's El Gezira. In April 2017, sources in White Nile state reported a rapid spread of cholera. The disease then spread to North Kordofan, and fully hit Khartoum in May 2017. The epidemic -- referred to as ""acute watery diarrhea"" by the Sudanese government and several international agencies operating in Sudan -- quickly spread in the camps for displaced people in Darfur when the 1st cases emerged in the region.In the past the DRDC [Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre], among others, lobbied for the WHO and other relief agencies to develop emergency plans with Khartoum after it would declare the existence of cholera in the country and stopped using ambiguous terms for the disease. The WHO, as well as the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) are responding to the 'acute watery diarrhea' disease by establishing health facilities in a number of Sudan's affected states, and training medical staff, a recent humanitarian news bulletin reported.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A map of Africa showing the location of Sudan in east Africa can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan>.

The 20-bed diarrhea treatment center, which opened Mon 2 Oct 2017, at the camp is one of 3 providing a total of 80 beds. 2 more centres are due to open next week [week of 9 Oct 2017]. ""Severe diarrhea causes dehydration, so quick and appropriate rehydration is vital to saving lives,"" explained Taimur Hasan, associate public health officer for UNHCR in Bangladesh, during a tour of the facility.Set in a U-shaped building surrounding a tall acacia tree, the centre has separate wards providing oral rehydration for milder cases, and intravenous saline rehydration, for patients with more severe diarrhea.""As of today, 4 Oct 2017, our staff, working with refugee volunteers, will fan out across the camp and nearby informal settlements to find people who might be sick but have not sought treatment."" An estimated 507 000 Rohingya have now sought safety in Bangladesh. ""Community health volunteers can provide rehydration on the spot with oral saline, or if needed, bring them here,"" Hasan said.Since violence flared up in Myanmar in late August 2017, an estimated 507 000 Rohingya have sought safety in Bangladesh. Most live in informal cities of bamboo and plastic shacks, where fresh water and sanitation are ""not optimal,"" Hasan said. Among the recent refugee influx, Bangladesh authorities have reported 10 247 cases of diarrhea, although the real incidence is certainly much higher.On a recent visit to the camp extension, this UNHCR reporter asked about 20 residents at an ad-hoc community meeting how many had fallen sick. A brief show of hands revealed about half had. Most of the informal camps and settlements were until recent weeks woodland. The public health challenge has arisen as thousands of new residents are defecating in close proximity to the water supply. Tests reveal that some water sources are contaminated with coliform bacteria. Measures to prevent the spread of disease also include the installation of 32 shallow tube wells, and 250 latrines so far, which UNHCR accomplished with the help of partners.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Bangladesh can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/bw2fuve> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63236>.
