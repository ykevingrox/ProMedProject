ECDC [edited]<https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/RRA-Malaria-EU-11-09-2017.pdf>On 7 Sep 2017, France reported 2 locally-acquired cases of malaria. Both cases attended a wedding that took place between 11 and 16 Aug 2017 in Moulins, in the Auvergne-RhÌ«ne-Alpes region of France. On 30 Aug 2017, the 1st case was hospitalised in southwest France after 4 days of fever, chills and sweats and was found positive for _P. falciparum_ malaria. The patient had not travelled abroad and had no risk factors for induced malaria. The only recent travel identified was to Moulins and its surrounding area to attend the wedding.On 1 Sep 2017, a 2nd case who attended the same wedding was diagnosed upon return to his home country outside the European Union. The case had onset of symptoms on 26 Aug 2017 and had neither exposure to induced malaria nor recent travel history to a malaria-endemic area.None of the wedding attendees reported a recent travel history to a malaria-endemic country or symptoms compatible with malaria. The regional health agency of Auvergne-RhÌ«ne-Alpes carried out active case-finding in local laboratories and hospitals. A case of _P. falciparum_ malaria imported from Burkina Faso was identified in an individual who stayed in Moulins and its surroundings for several days within the 2 weeks prior to the wedding.Entomological investigations conducted on 5-7 Sep 2017 in the area visited by the imported and locally-acquired cases showed evidence of the presence of _Anopheles maculipennis_ s.l. (under investigation for species identification) and _Anopheles claviger_ s.s. but did detect the presence of _Anopheles plumbeus_. Human landing catches revealed that these mosquitoes are not aggressive towards humans and are probably zoophilic in this area where there are many cows and horses. The French National Reference Centre for malaria is gathering samples for molecular typing to assess the link between the imported and the 2 locally-acquired cases.ECDC Risk AssessmentThe epidemiological investigation identified the presence of a case _P. falciparum_ malaria in the same area prior to the exposure period for the 2 reported cases. Both cases shared an epidemiological link with the imported malaria case in that they stayed in and around the city while attending the wedding event, which may have resulted in a local mosquito-borne transmission. Entomological investigations did not identify mosquito-vectors that could support the hypothesis of a vector-borne transmission by a competent local anopheline mosquito.A cluster of 2 airport malaria cases, therefore, remains a possible hypothesis. Molecular typing of the strains should provide further evidence. While a few additional cases may have been infected at the time of the event in France, the risk of further malaria spread in this area is very low.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the ECDC risk assessment concludes that there are not local Anopheles mosquitoes present that have the capacity as vectors to transmit _P. falciparum_, this remains the most probable explanation. The key question is whether _An. maculipennis_ can transmist _P. falciparum_, although it is well known to transmit _P. vivax_.The extrinsic incubation period in the mosquito fits with the time the _P. falciparum_ patient from Burkina Faso was in Moulin (2 weeks before the wedding), and the incubation period of 10-14 days after the wedding, both patients becoming ill on 26 Aug 2017, fits with the incubation period of _P. falciparum_ in the human host. Both patients were probably bitten by the same mosquito.The weather in Moulin in August 2017 shows an average 24-hour temperature above 20 C [68 F](<https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/archive/moulins_france_2991481?fcstlength=1m&year=2017&month=8>), which is a prerequisite for the development of _P. falciparum_ in the mosquito.Genotyping of the _P. falciparum_ parasites in the patient from Burkina Faso and the 2 French cases will determine whether the local cases were infected with the Burkina isolate or not. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/61530>.]
