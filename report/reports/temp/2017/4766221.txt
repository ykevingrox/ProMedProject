[reported as a newly confirmed case on 2 Jan 2017, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At the time of confirmation was classified as a primary case with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Erroneously reported by me as a newly reported recovery on 6 Jan 2017 (am still unable to reconcile when that individual was reported as a newly confirmed case) - Mod.MPP]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the past 4 days since the last update, there have been 4 newly confirmed cases, 1 fatality and 1 recovery reported.  Of note, in this same period, the official Saudi MERS-CoV information has added an addition 2 recoveries to the summary count of cases that I have not been able to find information on.In this 4 day period since the last update, there have been no new reports of cases from Buraidah, suggesting perhaps the nosocomial transmission related to the initial cases and transmission may have been interrupted, although with a 14 day incubation period it is too early to declare transmission is interrupted.As mentioned in the report of the recovery, on 6 Jan 2017, there had been a recovery reported in a ""60-year-old Saudi male from Madinah"".  As I was unable to find a matching individual on the line listing of newly confirmed cases, I speculated it was a 70-year-old male from Madinah.  As today's update contains information on the recovery of a 70 year old male from Madinah, my supposition on 6 Jan 2017 was correct.  Hence, the recovery reported on 6 Jan 2017 remains unlinked to previously reported cases.  If any of our subscribers has information that would resolve this dilemma, I'd be grateful to receive it.Noteworthy that of the 4 newly confirmed cases, all are classified as ""primary"" cases, with 1 having a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness and the remaining 3 are still under investigation for possible high risk exposures.Maps showing the locations of newly discussed cases, deaths and recoveries can be found at the source URLs.
