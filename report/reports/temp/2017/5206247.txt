WMBF News [edited]<http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/35963313/veterinarians-urge-vaccinations-after-dillon-co-horse-found-with-eee>A case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was discovered in a Dillon County horse last [Fri 21 Jul 2017], and now state veterinary officials are urging South Carolina horse owners to vaccinate their animals.This was the 1st case of EEE discovered this year [2017] in South Carolina, according to a news release from Clemson University. EEE is a serious, mosquito-borne illness in horses that can also affect humans. It is almost always fatal in unvaccinated horses, killing 90 percent of exposed, unvaccinated horses. The horse in Dillon did not survive.Symptoms of the disease usually develop in horses within 2 to 5 days after exposure, and include stumbling, circling, head-pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, inability to stand, muscle twitching or death, the release states. A simple vaccine will minimize the risk to horses and other equine species, the release continues. ""It can get out of hand if we don't vaccinate horses and control mosquitoes,"" said Boyd Parr, state veterinarian and director of Clemson University Livestock-Poultry Health. ""The best defense for horse owners is to maintain current equine vaccinations for eastern equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, and rabies for their horses.""In 2013, South Carolina led the nation in cases of EEE, with 49 infected horses, Clemson officials stated. Of those, all but one died. After that outbreak, due to increased vaccinations, there were only 7 cases of EEE in 2014 and 6 in 2015. There was another spike in cases last year [2016], with 15 infected horses.The release explains how the disease is transmitted: ""The EEE virus is maintained in nature through a cycle involving the freshwater swamp mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, commonly known as the black-tailed mosquito. 2 to 3 days after becoming infected with the virus a mosquito becomes capable of transmitting it. Infected mosquitoes can transmit the disease when they bite horses and humans.""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eastern equine encephalitis is a rare illness in humans. Most persons infected with it have no apparent illness. Severe cases begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. People who are concerned should contact their physicians, Parr said.The release concludes:Rains at crucial times across much of South Carolina made conditions favorable for mosquito breeding again this year [2017], Parr said. Any livestock, including horses, that display neurologic signs, such as stumbling, circling, head-pressing, depression or apprehension, must be reported to the state veterinarian at 803-788-2260 within 48 hours, according to state law.Information on animal diseases and reporting requirements can be found on the Livestock-Poultry Health website, www.clemson.edu/lph.[Byline: Ian Cross]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of South Carolina can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62077>.

The unvaccinated yearling became neurologic on [17 Jul 2017] and was euthanized for humane reasons. This the 1st case for Florida in 2017.EEE is a mosquito-transmitted disease that is much more severe than West Nile virus (WNV). The mortality rate in horses from WNV is reported at around 30 percent, while the rate for EEE is almost 90 percent. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for EEE. The virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General symptoms include central nervous system signs such as: head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 deg F [39.4 deg C], ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression, and stupor. Other symptoms may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All symptoms may not be exhibited by an infected horse.In related news, the Florida Department of Health (DOH) reported one eagle with West Nile virus (WNV) infection was reported in Sarasota County.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34924>.

The horse had not received vaccinations against the disease, according to Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain. ""This is the time of year mosquitoes are more prevalent,"" Strain said. ""Horses are infected the same way humans are infected -- by being bitten by infected mosquitoes -- so everyone needs to take extra precautionary measures at this time.""Strain recommends removing standing water and using mosquito repellants that are safe for horses.Eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus can spread to horses, dogs, cats, and humans if an infected mosquito bites an infected bird, Strain said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Louisiana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/30672>.

And you will have noted that all these affected horses had not been vaccinated. While this might be a convenient zoonotic red flag waving and thus epizootiologically interesting, it is very expensive for the individual horse owners. So if you are a clinical veterinarian get your clients to vaccinate their horses immediately; and if you own a horse, ditto. - Mod.MHJ]
