During the past 3 weeks, a significant increase in the number of suspected cholera cases has been reported in select districts of 7 governorates.

If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period. With the continued hostilities in Yemen and the onset of the rainy season, whatever was reported as a decrease in cases will likely and perhaps dramatically be reversed. In August 2017, 171 296 cases were reported; that is 5710 new cases of cholera PER DAY. Whether some of the newly reported upswing of cases are due to other causes is unclear since the ability to formally diagnose these cases is quite limited by military operations throughout the country.The statistics related to this record-breaking epidemic of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection in Yemen are shown below:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5322 Jun / 73 700 / 6054 Jun / 86 400 / 6765 Jun / 91 400 / 7286 Jun / 96 000 / 7467 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 114621 Jun / 179 548 / 120523 Jun / 200 000 / 131026 Jun / 219 000 / 140028 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15004 Jul / 275 987 / 16347 Jul / 297 438 / 170610 Jul / 313 538 / 173213 Jul / 332 600 / 175917 Jul / 356 591 / 180220 Jul / 368 207 / 182825 Jul / 402 484 / 188026 Jul / 408 583 / 188529 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199720 Aug / 542 278 / 200325 Aug / 565 041 / 201830 Aug / 591 100 / 20354 Sep / 612 703 / 20488 Sep / 635 752 / 2062In the last complete year of data (2015); <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries. This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only about 18 weeks old and is 3.68 times the total number of cases of 2015 and 87 percent more than the peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
