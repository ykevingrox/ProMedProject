Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/vibrio-vulnificus-deaths-reported-monroe-st-johns-counties-state-case-count-tops-40-86183/>According to Florida Department of Health data, as of 13 Oct 2017, 41 cases have been reported from 20 counties. In addition, 2 additional fatalities have been reported, 1each in St. Johns and Monroe Counties. In 2016, Florida reported 46 cases, including 10 deaths.The CDC says _Vibrio vulnificus_ is a bacterium in the same family as those that cause cholera and _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. It normally lives in warm seawater and is part of a group of vibrios that are called ""halophilic"" because they require salt. _V. vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to seawater. Among healthy people, ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In immunocompromised persons, particularly those with chronic liver disease, _V. vulnificus_ can infect the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50% of the time._V. vulnificus_ can cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulceration. Persons who are immunocompromised are at higher risk for invasion of the organism into the bloodstream and potentially fatal complications.[Byline: Robert Merriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at<http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.""The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.]
