BMJ Case Reports 2017; doi:10.1136/bcr-2017-220841 [edited]<http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220841.full>A 61-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with a one-week fever associated with progressive headache. She also reported weakness and paraesthesias in both legs. In the ED, the patient had normal vital parameters and reported no other medical history. Clinical examination showed slight neck stiffness; the rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory findings showed a mild inflammatory syndrome. The patient had a lumbar punction; the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed moderate pleocytosis (140 leucocytes/ë L with a mononuclear cell dominance). After a normal CT scan, an MRI examination was performed (figures 1and 2). Several days later, intrathecal IgM and IgG antibodies came back positive [for tick-borne encephalitis].Tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus that is transmitted by _Ixodes spp_ ticks in a vast area (from western Europe to Japan). TBEV is endemic in Europe where climatic conditions are suitable for its circulation. After an 8-day incubation period following the tick bite, frequently (1/3) unnoted by patients, the disease is usually biphasic. Initially, fever, fatigue and headache are the unspecific symptoms. The clinical spectrum in the 2nd stage ranges from meningitis to severe encephalitis or myelitis. Serodiagnosis of TBEV is mostly straightforward (TBEV-IgM and IgG in blood or CSF).1 This represents around 10Ûä000 cases every year; morbidity is age related (highest in adults). About 1/3 of patients will have long-lasting sequelae (cognitive dysfunction, postencephalitic syndrome). No specific treatment exists, and active immunization is the main preventive measure.Learning points - Flavivirus is transmitted by _Ixodes spp_ (from western Europe to the eastern coast of Japan). - The serological diagnosis is usually straightforward. - There is no specific treatment, and immunization is the main preventive measure.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not stated if the patient was infected in France or in Germany. Since 2 of the 3 authors are based in French health facilities, we assume that the patient was infected in France. Assuming that the patient is from France, this is the 1st report of a tick-borne encephalitis case that ProMED-mail has posted for France. However, the virus is widely distributed across Europe with many cases reported in Germany. This year (2017) evidence of virus presence in Netherlands in roe deer (_Capreolus capreolus_) and in _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks there was reported. It is reasonable to assume that the virus is circulating in France, as well. The WHO states, ""Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious."" <http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/>Tickborne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TYA HealthMap of France can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>.]
