She died [Fri 15 Sep 2017] of necrotizing fasciitis, according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Science, which reported that the dangerous skin condition resulted in complications related to ""blunt trauma of an upper extremity.""The death is the county's 36th Harvey-related fatality.She was a widowed community volunteer who lived in Kingwood, a northern suburb of Houston, according to the Houston Chronicle.At least one rescuer was also infected with the condition during the hurricane and its aftermath, the newspaper said, a former firefighter and medic who survived his bout with the infection, caused by an insect bite while he was assisting flood-ravaged victims in suburban Missouri City.[Byline: Marc Ramirez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Thu 7 Sep 2017 8:30 AMSource: Click 2 Houston [edited]<https://www.click2houston.com/health/first-responder-gets-deadly-infection-after-harvey-rescues>Necrotizing fasciitis is the clinical term for the infection a man developed while trying to rescue people from floodwaters after Hurricane Harvey. We've commonly heard that referred to as ""flesh-eating bacteria,"" and it is deadly. He caught the signs early enough to survive, but he warns others what to look for, since he knows many more Houstonians will come in contact with it during hurricane cleanup.The man is a former firefighter and a medic. During the major flooding, he was in trying to save his neighbors in Missouri City by boating through his neighborhood. He did not anticipate he would be the one who needed saving. ""I knew what I was getting into which is the scary thing. I was fully aware that this could happen,"" he said. Since he's trained in floodwater rescues, Atkins said he recognized the signs that a terrible infection was in his arm.""Next thing I knew there was a small little tiny bite, a little tiny bite on me that by that night grew to about a nickel-sized. The next morning, it had gone across the bone on the bottom side of my wrist and then like maybe 4 or 5 hours later it crossed the wrist and got into my hand and anytime the swell moves across the joint that's... I've always told that's been a bad thing,"" he said. He thought an insect bite must have left his skin open to toxic waters, so he went to Houston Methodist in Sugar Land where they recognized the emergency, rushed him to the intensive care unit, and prepped him for days of operations.""If it wouldn't have been for the nurses here at Methodist, I probably would have not been able to make it through it. I mean, there's no way I could have made it through it,"" he said. There's no way he could have survived, because Atkins started to get sepsis, meaning he was on a fast decline. Now he's worried someone without knowledge of these symptoms would never catch it in time or know that what's sitting around Houston homes now could have much higher levels of bacteria.""What I would like people to understand is that I went out in storm water, I didn't go out in sewage, and so if you look at what's going on in Houston and you look at the drainage issues... there's way worse stuff in there,"" he said. He is out of ICU but remains in the hospital. He said he would still be out cleaning up if he were not in the hospital but he urges people to take precautions while cleaning: wear gloves, masks, boots and goggles.If you are aware of a cut, place waterproof adhesives over your skin for protection and be aware that any swelling or redness should be seen by a doctor right away.[Byline: Haley Hernandez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Necrotizing fasciitis, also called ""flesh-eating disease"" is a rapidly progressive infection that destroys the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Most commonly the pathogen enters the body through a break in the skin, like a cut, scrape, burn, insect bite, or puncture wound. Most people who get necrotizing fasciitis have other health problems that include diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or other chronic health conditions that weaken the body's immune system.Patients usually complain of intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. Aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and administration of antibiotics are necessary. However, surgical intervention is often delayed after hospital admission, because these infections can be difficult to recognize in their early stages, and deep muscle necrosis may not be appreciated early on. The commonest type of bacteria causing necrotizing fasciitis is _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus or GAS), but fungi (such as Mucor) and other bacteria, such as _Aeromonas hydrophila_, _Vibrio vulnificus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, and mixtures of multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species, can cause necrotizing fasciitis.The microbiology in thes cases is not stated but because of water exposure, _V. vulnificus_ could well be the etiology. Overall, GAS are the most common causes of necrotizing fasciitis. Each year in the USA, GAS cause about 650-800 cases of necrotizing fasciitis (an incidence rate of about 0.2 per 100 000) and the CDC says that the incidence is not rising (<http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/>).Most cases of necrotizing fasciitis likely occur randomly and are not linked to similar infections in others. However, GAS infections can be highly contagious: skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowded conditions, e.g., in shelters for the homeless, would be expected to facilitate GAS spread from person to person. Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Streptococcal M protein is the major virulence factor of GAS, which has been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. GAS are now typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm>). Genotyping identified GAS genotype emm-59 in half of the cases in an outbreak of invasive GAS disease among the homeless and intravenous drug users in Thunder Bay, Ontario (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, emm-59, fatal - Canada: (ON) Archive Number: 20081011.3219). - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
