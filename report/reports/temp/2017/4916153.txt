Cholera is a disease that is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium, and it affects children and adults alike. The disease requires urgent treatment and can kill within hours if no such treatment is sought.According to Alexander Juwa, a district health officer in Nsanje, 11 suspected cholera cases have been registered at Ndamera Health Center. ""We did what we call rapid diagnostic testing, and it came out positive. We have set up a treatment unit there, and nobody has died,"" Juwa said. Juwa, however, could not say with certainty that the cholera outbreak was a spillover from Mozambique, because according to his knowledge, no patient ever mentioned having had contact with a Mozambican citizen.--Communicated by:ProMED-EAFR from HealthMap Alerts<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>[A map of Malawi showing regions can be found at: <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/malawi-administrative-map.jpg>. - Mod.MPP]******[6] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Manicaland province)Date: Thu 16 Mar 2017Source: Pindula [edited]<http://www.pindula.co.zw/news/2017/03/16/govt-high-alert-two-die-cholera/#.WM1Eujs1_IV>The government says it is on high alert following the death of 2 people in Manicaland Province from suspected cholera cases.There has also been a confirmed cholera case in Chiredzi while 3 suspected cases were recorded at Chinyamukwakwa Clinic in Chipinge in March 2017.

Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015; oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
