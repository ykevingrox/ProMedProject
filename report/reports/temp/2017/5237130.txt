Knoxville News Sentinel [edited]<http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2017/08/08/childrens-hospital-reports-increase-mosquito-borne-encephalitis-cases/550226001/>East Tennessee Children's Hospital is reporting a spike in children diagnosed with a mosquito-borne virus that, left undetected, can cause brain damage or, rarely, death.Dr. Lori Patterson, infectious disease physician at the hospital, said doctors there have seen 7 children in 4 weeks with La Crosse encephalitis.Typically, Tennessee sees a dozen cases of the virus in a year.Though Zika and West Nile viruses get more publicity, La Crosse encephalitis is the state's and the country's most common cause of mosquito-borne illness. The virus, which occurs more frequently in children 16 and younger, irritates the brain; symptoms can include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and dizziness, and in severe cases, seizures or coma. There's no vaccine or specific treatment for the virus itself; supportive care -- treating symptoms -- usually requires hospitalization.La Crosse encephalitis is diagnosed by blood test and is reportable to the state health department and the federal government. Patterson said Tuesday [8 Aug 2017] that the 7 hospital patients' diagnoses were confirmed. The state department of health hasn't provided a statewide number of cases for this year [2017], though East Tennessee typically sees far more cases than the rest of the state. All 3 of last year's [2016] confirmed cases were in this region, one each in Jefferson, Sevier and Hamblen counties. And East Tennessee and Appalachia are hotbeds for the virus, accounting for more than a quarter of cases nationally. Between 2004-2013, only North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia had more cases than Tennessee's 105, all but a few in the eastern part of the state. Most states reported no cases.In addition to the eastern treehole mosquito [_Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_], which can breed in as little as a tablespoon of water, the Asian tiger and Asian bush mosquitoes also carry La Crosse encephalitis, researchers at the University of Tennessee and in North Carolina confirmed in 2001.Not only are those 2 non-native species of mosquito prevalent in this area now, they're aggressive biters, said Dr. Rebecca Trout Fryxell, an entomologist and assistant professor at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. And all 3 species bite during the day.""Last year [2016], our mosquito populations were increasing in abundance until the drought occurred in mid-July 2016,"" Fryxell said. ""This year [2017], we have yet to see the mosquito populations peak and start to decline; they've continued to increase overall and at each trap site,"" she said.Knox County sprays for the _Culex_ mosquito, which carries West Nile virus, in neighborhoods where trapped mosquitoes test positive for West Nile, usually a handful a year. But the chemicals used -- a mixture of synthetic permethrin and piperonyl butoxide -- don't affect the eastern treehole mosquito, which likes wooded areas and lays eggs in tiny hollows, or the non-native species. And while the _Culex_ mosquito is more active at night, atmospheric conditions make spraying ineffective during daylight hours, when the Asian tiger and Asian bush mosquitoes are biting.What can make a difference is applying a repellent containing the chemical compound DEET, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, and dressing children in long sleeves and long pants when possible, health officials said. Keeping grass and shrubbery short, ridding your property of dead trees, filling in hollow stumps with sand or concrete, and dumping standing water around your property -- even the little bit that collects under flowerpots or on trash-can lids or pool covers -- also can help, as can treating water in birdbaths and landscaping pools with ""mosquito dunks"" available at hardware and farm stores [Discarded vehicle tires also accumulate water and can serve as effective breeding sites for the eastern treehole mosquito. - Mod.TY].""August and September are always bad mosquito months,"" Fryxell said.[Byline: Kristi L Nelson]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As noted in the above report, eastern Tennessee is one of the focal La Crosse virus (LACV) endemic areas. Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children, and cases in adults are somewhat unusual. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur, and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal.The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus maintained through transovarial transmission.As noted in earlier comments, LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio, and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at <http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>). There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA.The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at <https://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>.An image of _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_ can be seen at <http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=2166>.Tennessee can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62013>. - Mod.TY]
