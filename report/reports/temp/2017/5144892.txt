ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report 1 Jul 2017 [edited]<https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/Communicable-disease-threats-report-01-jul-2017.pdf>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - MultistateOpening date: [24 Sep 2012] Latest update: [30 Jun 2017]Epidemiological summarySince the last update of MERS-CoV on [9 Jun 2017], 41 additional cases of MERS-CoV have been reported, 40 from Saudi Arabia and one reported by Lebanon in a Lebanese citizen returning from Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia: among the 40 recently reported cases on [19 Jun 2017], 13 are associated to 2 previously identify clusters.The 1st cluster is related to nosocomial transmission in a hospital of Riyadh where 32 cases have been laboratory confirmed. All the cases were asymptomatic.The 2nd cluster is also related to nosocomial transmission in another hospital in Riyadh where one suspect case and 8 laboratory confirmed cases have been identified.A 3rd cluster was reported in a 3rd hospital in Riyadh on [13 June 2017]. This cluster includes 6 cases, including one asymptomatic case who visited the emergency room of the hospital of the 1st cluster. The other 5 cases are secondary household and health care worker contacts.Lebanon: on [28 June 2017], Lebanon reported one imported case from Saudi Arabia. The case developed symptoms before traveling back from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon. The patient is isolated at home and authorities started contact tracing.One case of MERS has previously been reported in Lebanon on 9 May 2014.According to WHO, since April 2012 and as of [30 June 2017], 2030 cases of MERS, including 704 deaths, have been reported by health authorities worldwide.ECDC assessmentThe extent to which healthcare facilities in Riyadh are affected is unknown, as is the number of asymptomatic individuals who may be infected with MERS-CoV. The role of hospitals as amplifiers of MERS-CoV infection is now well known, making the strict and timely application of infection prevention and control measures imperative. Sporadic, imported cases can be expected in EU/EEA Member States, and are associated with a risk of nosocomial spread. This highlights the need for awareness among healthcare workers, early detection through functioning testing algorithms, preparedness planning and application of strict infection prevention and control measures.The risk of sustained human-to-human transmission in Europe remains very low. ECDC's conclusion continues to be that the MERS-CoV outbreak poses a low risk to the EU, as stated in a rapid risk assessment published on 21 October 2015, which provides details on the last case reported in Europe.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The HealthMap/ProMED map of Lebanon can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/85>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Lebanon ex Saudi Arabia - Lebanon MOH 16 Jun 2017 [accessed 1 Jul 2017] [In Arabic, mach.trans, edited] RFIDate: Mon 19 Jun 2017Source: Lebanon MOH 19 Jun 2017 [accessed 1 Jul 2017] [in Arabic, mach.trans, edited]<http://www.moph.gov.lb/en/Media/view/12880/1/press-release-on-19-06-2017-concerning-the-diagnosis-of-infection-with-the-mers-coronavirus>Press Release on [19 Jun 2017] Concerning the diagnosis of a MERS-Coronavirus infectionThe Ministry of Public Health report on the diagnosis of a human infection with the MERS-CoV on 16 Jun 2017The patient returned to Lebanon from Saudi Arabia complaining of several days of high fever, without acute respiratory symptoms. He received the necessary treatment and is currently in good health at his home where he is subjected to domestic isolation and control by the Ministry of Public Health. The Ministry is also monitoring all identified contacts of the patient and those who were near him during his travel to and residence in Lebanon.Note that this is the 2nd case of MERS-CoV infection diagnosed in Lebanon, the 1st case having been recorded in 2014. That case was also treated with preventive measures and did not result in transmission of the virus to other individuals in Lebanon.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[As mentioned above, this is the 2nd laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Lebanon. Interestingly, the 1st reported case (9 Jun 2014) was an individual who had returned to Lebanon after traveling in the Gulf region, including to Saudi Arabia. (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (54): Saudi Arabia, Lebanon 20140509.2461876 and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (53): Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, RFI 20140509.2459095).Neither one of the above reports on this case provide demographic nor epidemiologic information other than the case occurred in a Lebanese citizen who traveled to Saudi Arabia. More information detailing the age, gender, location of travel in Saudi Arabia, possible high risk exposures while there (contact with camels, camel products, contact with the health facilities, contact with any known MERS-CoV infected individual) and purpose of trip to Saudi Arabia (was the individual participating in Umrah, attending business meetings, a tourist). ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving more information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Saudi Arabia 1 new case - Saudi MOH 29 Jun - 1 Jul 2017Date: Sat 1 Jul 2017Source: Saudi MOH 29 Jun - 1 Jul 2017 [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx?PageIndex=1>As of today [Sat 1 Jul 2017], there have been a total of:1672 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including678 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.6 percent],974 recoveries, and20 currently active cases/infections.[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections.]Since the last ProMED-mail update [28 Jun 2017], there have been a total of:1 newly confirmed case/infection1 newly reported fatality, and4 newly reported recoveries.Information on newly confirmed case/infection with MERS-CoVDate: Sat 1 Jul 2017<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2017-07-01-001.aspx> - A 70-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, from Al Baha [Al BÂ€ hah Region] currently in stable condition.

The findings support further development of the drug candidate for treating and preventing current coronavirus infections and potential future epidemic outbreaks.A new antiviral drug candidate inhibits a broad range of coronaviruses, including the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, a multi-institutional team of investigators reports this week [week of 25 Jun-1 Jul 2017] in Science Translational Medicine. The findings support further development of the drug candidate for treating and preventing current coronavirus infections and potential future epidemic outbreaks.Coronaviruses are a genetically diverse family of viruses that infect birds and mammals, with most coronavirus strains limited to infecting only certain hosts. Human coronaviruses, for example, cause up to 30 percent of common colds.In the last 15 years, however, coronaviruses have demonstrated their ability to jump into new species. Zoonotic (animal) coronaviruses have infected humans, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe diseases with high mortality rates ranging from 10 percent for SARS to 40 percent for MERS. The MERS-coronavirus continues to cause new infections in the Middle East.""There's a real concern that the MERS coronavirus could escape broadly when millions of people visit Saudi Arabia for the Hajj,"" said Mark Denison, M.D., Craig-Weaver Professor of Pediatrics and professor of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.But to date, there has been no effective antiviral drug for any known coronavirus, Denison noted.Denison and his team at Vanderbilt have studied the basic biology of coronaviruses for more than 20 years. In an effort to find chemical tools that would allow them to probe viral replication, graduate student Brett Case screened a series of compounds selected and provided by Gilead Sciences.Case demonstrated that one of the compounds was highly active against coronaviruses in cultured cells. The finding was a surprise, Denison said, because compounds in the same class (nucleoside analogs) have normally failed to inhibit coronavirus replication.The compound, called GS-5734, is currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease.Denison's longtime collaborator Ralph Baric, Ph.D., at the University of North Carolina and his team demonstrated that GS-5734 inhibits SARS-coronavirus and MERS-coronavirus replication in multiple in vitro systems, including cultures of primary human airway epithelial cells, which are the cells infected by respiratory coronaviruses.The researchers also showed that GS-5734 was effective against a circulating human coronavirus, bat coronaviruses, and bat coronaviruses that are considered ""prepandemic"" because they can infect cultured human cells.Using a mouse model of SARS, the investigators demonstrated that both prophylactic (before infection) and early therapeutic (soon after infection) administration of GS-5734 reduced viral load in the lungs and improved respiratory functions.""This compound shows broad activity against a variety of human and animal coronaviruses and represents an exciting potential therapeutic for a family of viruses prone to emergence from animal reservoirs,"" Denison said.Denison and his team at Vanderbilt will continue to use the compound ""as a probe to try to understand the biology of the virus, how and why this drug works, and to identify new targets for inhibiting coronaviruses,"" he said.""This is an exciting example of how pursuing fundamental research to understand the mechanisms of virus replication and pathogenesis can lead to an important compound with therapeutic potential.""Journal Reference:Timothy P. Sheahan et al. Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses. Science Translational Medicine, June 2017 DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653 [full article available at: <http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/396/eaal3653.full>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[We usually shy away from posting early studies on possible new biologics or antimicrobial agents as many new promising agents look very promising in in vitro studies and in laboratory animal models but when transferred to humans either fail in terms of safety or in terms of efficacy. That being said, for those interested in the field, I strongly recommend reading this article. In the past 15 years, we've dealt with 2 coronaviruses that have done species jump from bats through intermediary hosts into humans with significant mortality. In 2002-2003 there was the SARS-CoV and since 2012 the MERS-CoV. In both cases, no existing antiviral agents have been effective therapeutically, with the MERS-CoV having a reported case fatality rate of approximately 40 percent (reported by Saudi Arabia, and somewhat less on the global level). - Mod.MPP]
