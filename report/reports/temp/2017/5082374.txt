Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in north eastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology. This case, however, is a confirmed JE case.Pigs may serve as amplifying hosts, but the reservoir species are avians, including ardeid birds (such as herons and egrets), which can be the species responsible for maintenance and movement of the virus in the area. Repeated insecticide spraying can reduce population of culex mosquitoes, but vaccination of individuals is likely to be the most effective way to prevent JE cases. The Malkangiri district administration had a vaccination program for children in the age group of 1-15 against Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus until 24 Dec 2016
