The Group has argued that the world is now a big village, where the borders between countries are crossed by millions every day for different reasons -- a better life for some, migration for others, all due to different factors, including climate change and the outbreak of fast-spreading diseases. According to the Group, joined by China, Lourdes Pereira of the Ecuadorian Mission to the UN /Fifth Committee, since the 2014-2015 EVD outbreak, it quickly became evident that one country alone, with limited capacities and resources, could not handle a threat of an EVD outbreak spreading across borders, particularly, if it was not contained with global efforts. It also became evident that regional and international organizations in charge of health, in particular the World Health Organization (WHO), did not have the relevant mechanisms and resources in place for a rapid response to stem the tide of the crisis. ...more]21 Apr 2017 USA: Amnesty for refugees from Ebola-affected countries expires next month [May 2017]<https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/21/ebola-refugees/>[Thousands of immigrants allowed entry to the US to escape from West Africa's recent Ebola outbreak now face deportation, as the program that allowed them residence is ending.

Keita M, ContÌ© F, Diallo B, et al: Lessons learned by surveillance during the tail-end of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, June-October 2015: a case series. BMC Infect Dis. 2017 Apr 24; 17(1): 304.Abstract. By the end of the 2013-2016 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks, a total of 3814 cases (probable and confirmed) and 2544 deaths were reported in Guinea. Clearly, surveillance activities aiming at stopping human-to-human transmission have been the breakthrough of EVD outbreak management, but their application has been at times easier said than done. This article presents 5 confirmed or probable EVD cases that arose in Conakry towards the end of the Guinea epidemic, which demonstrate flaws in surveillance and follow-up.Case Presentation. For case 1, safe burial requirements were not followed. For cases 1 and 2, negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results were interpreted as no infection. For the 1st case, the sample may have not been taken properly while for the 2nd the disease was possibly at its early stage. Case 3 was stopped at a border health checkpoint and despite her high temperature she was allowed to continue the bus journey. For case 4, an oral swab sample was supposedly taken after death but could not be found for retrospective testing. Despite characteristic symptomatology, case 5 was not identified as a suspect case for as long as 3 weeks.Conclusion. In epidemic contexts, health systems must be able to track all samples of suspect cases and deaths, regardless of their laboratory results. Social mobilization in communities and training in health care facilities must be strengthened at the tail of an outbreak, to avoid the natural slackening of disease surveillance, in particular for long-lasting and deadly epidemics.]25 Apr 2017: Ebola virus disease in children during the 2014-2015 epidemic in Guinea: a nationwide cohort study.<http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00431-017-2914-z>[Citation. ChÌ©rif MS, Koonrungsesomboom N, Kasse D, et al: Ebola virus disease in children during the 2014-2015 epidemic in Guinea: a nationwide cohort study. Eur J Pediatr. 2017; doi: 10.1007/s00431-017-2914-zAbstract. The most recent epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has resulted in more than 11 000 deaths in West Africa. It has threatened child health in the affected countries, including Guinea. This nationwide retrospective cohort study included all children under 20 years of age with laboratory-confirmed EVD in Guinea during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak for analysis. Of 8448 children with probable or suspected EVD, 695 cases were laboratory-confirmed EVD. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 62.9 percent. Pediatric patients with younger age had a significantly higher rate of death (adjusted OR [odds ratio] = 0.995; 95 percent CI = 0.990-1.000; p = 0.046), with the highest CFR of 82.9 percent in children aged less than 5 years. Fever (91 percent), fatigue (87 percent), and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (70 percent) were common clinical features on admission of the pediatric patients, while bleeding signs were not occurring often (24 percent).Conclusion. EVD is a major threat to child health, especially among children under 5 years of age. To date, none of demographic and clinical features, except younger age, have been consistently shown to affect mortality outcome in children infected with Ebola virus.). None of clinical features and epidemiologic risk factors for Ebola were associated with mortality outcome in our cohort study.26 Apr 2017: Can Ebola virus evolve to be less virulent in humans?<http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/26/108589>[Citation. Sofonea MT, Aldakak L, Boullosa LFVV, et al: Can Ebola virus evolve to be less virulent in humans? bioRxiv 108589; doi: 10.1101/108589Abstract. Understanding Ebola virus (EBOV) virulence evolution is not only timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures 3 transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio (CFR) on the scale of an outbreak and on the long term. Our major finding is that the virus's specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOV's high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains.]Vaccines--------19 Apr 2017: Ebola vaccine maker CanSino raises USD 65 million<http://www.sixthtone.com/news/ebola-vaccine-maker-cansino-raises-65-million-investments>[After developing an Ebola vaccine, Chinese pharmaceutical startup CanSino this week announced a new round of investment in which it had raised USD 65 million, marking one of the largest capital injections into a Chinese biomedical company in recent years.The company will use the funds to build a new 35 000-square-meter facility in the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area in northern China, next to its current facility and about 2 hours' drive from Beijing, and will cover costs to complete several clinical trials, Xuefeng Yu, CanSino's CEO, told Sixth Tone.In 2014, CanSino started working on an Ebola vaccine based on the virus strain that caused the recent outbreak in West Africa ....

Huttner A, Combescure C, Grillet S, et al. Measuring the safety, efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola virus disease. ScienceDaily, 18 April 2017. <http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170418114348.htm> DOI10.1126/scitranslmed.aaj1701Summary. The 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic affected several countries in West Africa, leading to the death of more than 11 000 people. Although this epidemic of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] is over, there is no knowing if, when or where another may strike. It is therefore more important than ever to find a reliable vaccine against this deadly disease. Research on vaccines, which was ongoing during the epidemic in West Africa, is now yielding promising results. An international team based at Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and at the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, has succeeded in defining a ""signature"" composed of a small number of inflammatory markers that can be monitored in order to understand how a promising anti-Ebola virus vaccine stimulates the immune system. The researchers inoculated 115 volunteers with either a high dose or a low dose of the rVSV-ZEBOV anti-Ebola vaccine, or with placebo. By analyzing the differences between the 3 groups, they found that it is sufficient to monitor only 5 substances that are naturally present in the blood in order to define immune responses to the vaccine. The ""Geneva rVSV-ZEBOV signature"" is published in a scientific paper, in Science Translational Medicine. It's an easy-to-use equation adding up the concentrations of these 5 substances or markers, most of which are mediated by monocytes, a class of white blood cells known to be active in combatting Ebolavirus in infected individuals. The signature is also expected to inform investigations of safety and immunogenicity of other emerging vaccines.]Funding-------26 Apr 2017: A Harvard doctor just won USD 1 million for a project that could prevent the next Ebola outbreak.<https://www.businessinsider.com.au/raj-panjabi-harvard-ted-prize-2017-4>[Dr Raj Panjabi just won the USD 1 million TED Prize for an idea that could dramatically increase the number of paid community health workers around the world.
