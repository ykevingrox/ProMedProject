Three cases of foodborne illnesses have recently been recorded in a family in Ouarzazate [Province of Ouarzazate, Draa-Tafilalet region], which led to the death of the mother and her daughter.According to the National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA), these cases are due to the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_"" which was found in the samples analyzed by the Office's services. The Office is expected to disclose the identity of the product in question for the safety of consumers.It should be noted that the products usually incriminated in these poisoning cases are ""traditional and family food preserves"". In any case, the exact name given by ONSSA indicates that ""the production unit at the origin of the product in question works with great professionalism"" and that its products ""are healthy and meet all standards in force"".--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The ProMED MENA moderation mentions that the food vehicle for what is reported to be botulism was sausage but it is not entirely clear if the product was commercially or home produced (PRO/MENA> Foodborne illness - Morocco (09): (Draa-Tafilalet), fatal, botulism, RFI). Botulism, or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, was 1st seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as ""botulism"" after ""botulus"", the Latin word for sausage.DrÌ¢a-Tafilalet is one of the 12 regions of Morocco and is located in the Atlas Mountains in northwest Morocco and can be seen on a map at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr%C3%A2a-Tafilalet> - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59945>.]
