Denver (CO) Post [edited]<http://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/10/colorado-hepatitis-a-cases/>The state health department is urging at-risk Coloradans to get vaccinated for hepatitis A after 26 cases of the liver infection were reported in the state since January 2017. That 4-month total is more than Colorado typically sees in a year.Most of the cases were in Front Range counties and all involved adults. Hepatitis A is a virus contracted by eating food or drinks contaminated with fecal matter from an infected person or through sexual contact with an infected person, including oral-anal contact. Those at higher risk include men who have sex with men, people who use drugs through injection, and people who are homeless.Among the 26 cases reported so far in 2017, the majority involved men and more than half involved men who had sex with men.Vaccines are routinely recommended for children but most adults are not vaccinated against hepatitis A. People at higher risk are urged to get the vaccine, ""which is extremely safe and highly effective,"" said state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Most of the recent outbreaks of HAV in the USA have been foodborne although the ongoing large outbreak in San Diego is of unclear source. That being said, the sexual practices of men who have sex with men is the risk factor for transmission of hepatitis A as can be seen by the clusters of HAV occurring in the European Union and seems to be the case in this uptick in HAV infection in Colorado.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from ACIP are:Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications: - Men who have sex with men; - people who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs; - people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; - people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates; - people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and - unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209>.]
