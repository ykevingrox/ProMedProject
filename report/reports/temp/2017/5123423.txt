Leicester Mercury [edited]<http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/parents-warned-to-watch-out-for-signs-of-very-infectious-e-coli-strain-after-pupil-taken-ill/story-30400893-detail/story.html>Parents have been warned to be alert for signs of a ""very infectious"" strain of _E. coli_ after a pupil was taken ill. A pupil from Thurnby Lodge Primary, in Leicester, contracted the O157 strain of the bug, which can cause kidney damage. The source of the infection, caught over the half-term holidays, is not known, the school said. The severity of the illness has not been disclosed, but pupils in the same class were sent letters by Public Heath England.The letter said because the strain was very infectious it could be spread easily within families and other settings such as schools where there were younger children and it was difficult to keep everything thoroughly clean. Symptoms of this _E. coli_ infection include diarrhea. In about 50 per cent of cases, sufferers have bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever. The letter said that transmission could be prevented through good hygiene. Parents were told to take their child to their GP should they show any of the symptoms.Public Health England said it was trying to identify the source of the infection. A spokesman said: ""_E. coli_ is contracted in a number of ways environmentally, so this can be difficult to confirm."" Sources of infection include eating infected food such as raw leafy vegetables undercooked meat or raw milk products. Touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their feces, such as at petting farms and campsites can also lead to infection. Contact with infected people, poor food hygiene and cleanliness, drinking water from poorly treated water supplies or swimming or playing in infected water, such as ponds or streams, are other sources.A spokeswoman for the school said: ""Thurnby Lodge Primary has received no further notifications of such incidents and it is deemed likely that the child was infected outside of school during the holidays. The letters from Public Health England came via the academy and were just a precautionary measure.""_E. coli_ normally lives in the intestines of humans and animals. Although most strains are harmless, several are known to produce toxins that can cause diarrhea. The O157 strain can cause severe diarrhea and kidney damage.[Byline: Fiona Dryden]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ are not uncommon in primary school and day care centers, as, especially with young children, there is ample opportunity for child-to-child transmission related to less than ideal hygiene.
