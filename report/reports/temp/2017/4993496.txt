ECDC [edited]<http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/20-mar-2017-RRA-cluster-new-Salmonella-serotypes-four-eu-member-states.pdf>On 10 May 2016, Greece reported a cluster of salmonellosis with an antigenic formula 11:z41:e, n, z15, not previously described in the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor-scheme [1]. The isolates from these cases were susceptible to 16 antimicrobial agents, and their PFGE profiles were indistinguishable (The European Surveillance System (TESSy) reference XbaI.2460): <https://tessy.ecdc.europa.eu/TessyWeb/OnlineQueryTool/Query.aspx?type=ClusterAnalysis&subject=SALMISO&method=Cl uster&clustercode=2016-07.SALM.03.XBAI.2460>.On 26 May 2016, the Pasteur Institute in Paris confirmed the results of the Greek laboratory, verifying a putative new serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ subspecies _enterica_. If this finding is confirmed by the additional testing, which is currently being performed, a name will be given to the new serotype. For the purpose of the Rapid Risk/Outbreak Assessment the following case definition is used:A confirmed outbreak caseÛ¢ A laboratory-confirmed case of salmonellosis yielding isolates with an antigenic formula 11:z41:enz15 according to the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor-scheme ORÛ¢ A laboratory-confirmed Salmonella with whole genome sequence matching the outbreak strain. Sequence data from a representative isolate with the sequence identification code 239-2016 have been uploaded to Enterobase (<https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>).Epidemiological situationBetween March 2016 and [Wed 15 Mar 2017], 4 EU Member States reported 40 cases infected with the new Salmonella serotype:-Greece has reported 22 cases since March 2016, including 15 children aged under 15 years. Two cases have been detected in 2017, the most recent case at the end of February. By the end of the last quarter of 2016, the National Reference Centre had received around 200 Salmonella isolates, which are waiting to be serotyped; thus, additional cases reported during that period could emerge at a later date. In August 2016, Greece reported an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing _Salmonella_ 11:z41:e, n, z15 carrying a blaSHV-5 like gene isolated from a relapse case. - Germany has reported 10 cases with the new Salmonella serotype since May 2016 and the last case was notified in February 2017. A total of 4 cases reported an epidemiological link to Greece, either through travel to Greece or a case visited by Greek relatives. The other 6 cases were exposed in Germany. - Czech Republic has reported 5 cases (2 males and 3 females) 3 of which are children. The most recent case was notified at the end of June 2016. None of the cases were travel-related. - Luxembourg has reported 1 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic cases, with the latest notification in February 2017.Microbiological informationAt least 11 isolates from Czech Republic, Germany, Greece and Luxembourg share an indistinguishable PFGE profile (TESSy reference XbaI.2460). An ECDC contractor has performed WGS for 9 isolates. WGS data analysis performed in Germany concluded that 13 human isolates from Germany (exposed either in Greece or in Germany), Greece, Luxembourg and Czech Republic were clustered tightly together by cgMLST (Figure 1 [for figure, see original URL. - Mod. LL]). A total of 12 countries (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland) reported not having observed any human Salmonella isolates with this antigenic formula. Salmonella isolates/cases with antigenic formula 11:z41:e, n, z15 or PFGE profile XbaI.2460 had not been reported to TESSy before April 2016.ECDC public health threat assessment for the EU/EEAIn the past 9 months, 4 EU Member States have reported 40 cases with the infection of a new _Salmonella_ serotype 11:z41:enz15 with an antigenic formula that has never been described before. PFGE and WGS analyses have confirmed that the isolates from these cases are genetically very close, and thus they are probably associated with a common source of infection. An epidemiological analytical study performed in Greece found an association between infection with the new _Salmonella_ serotype and a sesame-based product. This hypothesis was later supported by Germany, where the same Salmonella serotype was found in imported sesame seeds. As sesame seeds have a long shelf life and new cases have been reported recently, it is likely that contaminated batches are circulating in the food chain in EU Member States. Although the human infection is relatively rare, it is likely that new cases may occur.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Based on the nomenclature in World Health Organization (WHO)/Institut Pasteur.

Their work was mostly ignored until Weil and Felix, working on _Proteus_ cultures, noted 2 forms, the swarming form called the H form (_mit Hauch_, in English: ""with breath"") and the non-swarming form, called the O form (_ohne Hauch_, in English: ""without breath""). The H form contained both O and H antigens (correctly termed the OH form). These parallels were transposed to the salmonella antigens. - Mod.LL]
