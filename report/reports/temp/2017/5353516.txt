Both Houston and Missouri City, TX were inundated with flood waters from rain and overflowing freshwater streams/rivers. The distance of these communities from the Gulf of Mexico and the lack of salinity in the flood waters were not conditions conducive to _V. vulnificus_ transmission. In these cases of necrotizing fasciitis, the pathogenic organisms were more likely the person's own indigenous flora. Storm related trauma, especially in the recovery phase, produces the skin trauma and the portal of entry. Except maybe for deep penetrating wounds, host impairments usually have a role.While the flood waters were no doubt a bacterial soup, an intact integumentary is damn good protection. I was in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The most common infection encountered here were staphylococcal skin infections developing at the sites of minor skin breaks or scratching following insect bites.--Dr. Brobson Lutz<home@combsandlutz.com>[ProMED thanks Dr. Lutz for his appropriate comments.
