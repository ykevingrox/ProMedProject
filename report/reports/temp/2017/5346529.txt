UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, Oxfam report [edited]<https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-cholera-outbreak-now-world-s-largest-record>Yemen cholera outbreak now the world's largest on record--------------------------------------------------------Yemen's 5-month old cholera crisis is now the world's largest outbreak since records began, Oxfam said today, 28 Sep 2017, as the number of suspected cases rose to over 755 000. The Yemen outbreak has overtaken the 754 373 suspected cases recorded in Haiti in the 6 years between 2010 and 2015. Over 2100 people have already died from cholera, and while the spread of cholera has slowed slightly, it is still spreading fast and at current rates of increase, the number of suspected cases would reach a million by November 2017.While cholera isn't new to Yemen, the scale of this outbreak is unprecedented and is being driven by a 2 1/2 year conflict, a border line famine and entrenched poverty. Over 1/2 of all health facilities are destroyed or only partially working, 7 million people are a step away from famine, and over 20 million need some level of humanitarian aid.Nigel Timmins, Oxfam's Humanitarian Director, said: ""Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis and it is getting even worse. More than 2 years of war have created ideal conditions for the disease to spread. The war has pushed the country to the edge of famine, forced millions from their homes, virtually destroyed the already weak health services and hampered efforts to respond to the cholera outbreak. Cholera is taking a horrific toll on people in Yemen. We cannot continue to allow children to die in pain of a disease that is easily treatable. Yemen's tragedy is a man-made catastrophe for which all sides bear responsibility. Yet it is being fuelled by deliberate political decisions in London, Washington and other world capitals. Billions of dollars worth of arms are being sold with little if any concern for the destruction of lives their use is causing. Our common humanity tells us this has to stop and efforts to foster peace have to start.""20 percent of Yemen's districts show a clear convergence of high levels of hunger and cholera. The governorate of Hajjah for example, which hosts 1/5 of Yemen's internally displaced people because of war, is both on the brink of famine and has the 2nd highest number of suspected cholera cases among the governorates. Many displaced families have told Oxfam that they have been forced to choose between getting treatment for cholera or feeding their families. With nothing left to sell, weakened by hunger and the lack of clean water, they are much more vulnerable to contract cholera and are struggling to get treatment. Only 45 percent of health facilities are fully functional because of the war and the number of people unable to access to healthcare has increased by 76 per cent since the escalation of the conflict according to the UN, while the costs of treatment or transportation to the working facilities are now often too high for people.Notes to editors:- Based on current rates (average 6900 daily cases for the past week), the number of suspected cholera cases went over 755 000 on 28 Sep 2018. From 27 Apr to 27 Sep 2017, 753 098 suspected cholera cases and 2122 deaths (CFR: 0.28 percent) have been reported in 21 out of 22 governorates in Yemen, and 91 percent (304/333) of the districts. Yemen: cholera outbreak daily epidemiology update, 27 Sep 2017 - WHO (<http://www.emro.who.int/yem/yemeninfocus/situation-reports.html>).- From 25 Aug until 27 Sep 2017, there has been an average of 5750 daily cases, so at this rate, the number of suspected cholera cases will reach one million in less than 8 weeks.- Figures of previous cholera outbreaks were taken from the WHO's Global Health Observatory data repository <http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.175?lang=en>--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2514 May / 11 000 / 18021 May / 29 300 / 31527 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 5326 Jun / 96 000 / 74614 Jun / 140 116 / 98921 Jun / 179 548 / 120528 Jun / 231 364 / 143930 Jun / 240 000 / 15007 Jul / 297 438 / 170613 Jul / 332 600 / 175920 Jul / 368 207 / 182829 Jul / 419 804 / 19127 Aug / 463 000 / 194013 Aug / 494 000 / 196617 Aug / 527 000 / 199725 Aug / 565 041 / 201830 Aug / 591 100 / 20358 Sep / 635 752 / 206217 Sep / 686 783 / 209020 Sep / 704 454 / 210324 Sep / 738 212 / 211727 Sep / 753 098 / 2122In the last complete year of data (2015); <http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250142/1/WER9138.pdf>, WHO reported a total of 172 454 cases worldwide in 42 countries. This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only 20 weeks old and is 4.3 times the total number of global cases of 2015 and 2.17 times the entire peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. The low case fatality rate of 0.3 percent might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. As noted, there are now more cases in less than 6 months than the 1st 5+ years of the Haitian cholera disaster. As estimates here have been suggesting for some time, the total will likely break 1 million by 2017's end. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
