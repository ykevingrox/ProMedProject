Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/madagascar-plague-outbreak-case-count-reaches-500/>In a follow-up on the Madagascar plague outbreak, the [Ministry of Public Health] reported an additional 51 news plague cases today, 11 Oct 2017, bringing the total cases since August 2017 to 500. On 11 Oct 2017, 29 new pneumonic plague cases were reported, while and additional 12 bubonic plague cases were reported. 10 suspect cases were also recorded. In addition, 6 additional deaths have been reported, bringing the total to 54. The capital city of Antananarivo saw an additional 37 cases, mostly pneumonic, and 4 deaths.In a message from Minister of Communication and Relations with the Institutions, Harry Laurent Rahajason writes:""This epidemic is our common enemy, we must defeat it. Immediately, the government mobilized all means of response. We worked in close cooperation with the World Health Organization, as well as multiple partners, international organizations and countries. The Malagasy specialists in epidemiology and those of the Institut Pasteur are actively present in support of the Crisis Staff. The national plan of action against plague has been adapted to the present situation, with the support of national and international partners.First, we pay close attention to inpatients, and protect persons who have come into contact with them. In the affected areas, our teams are on the ground 24 hours a day. Secondly, teams of international experts and doctors have been on the ground for several days and more are expected. We have also strengthened airport controls. In order to protect our children, and in order not to expose them to allergies following the disinfection of the buildings, the return to school is postponed by one week on 16 Oct 2017.We have temporarily suspended gatherings to the general public in places where the traceability of the participants is difficult if not impossible (stadiums, sports palaces, gymnasiums ...).The most important is to present yourself to the health services if you have symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache, cough, difficulty breathing, or sputum with some blood. The health services will take care of you immediately and apply the appropriate treatment.""[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The rapid rise of cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection with a predominance of pneumonic plague is quite worrisome.Date / Cases / Deaths---------------------14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 530 Sep 2017 / 73 / 173 Oct 2017 / 194 / 305 Oct 2017 / 258 / 367 Oct 2017 / 343 / 428 Oct 2017 / 387 / 459 Oct 2017 / 449 / 4810 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54It is frightening to monitor substantial outbreaks of infectious diseases in 2017. Although the specter of emerging zoonoses such as influenza H7N9 is worrisome (the pandemic clock is ticking, we just do not know what time it is), this year some of the old favorites are back on the front page:- Plague in Madagascar with urban cases and a predominance of pneumonic involvement with large numbers relatively early in plague season on the island and at least one case exported to Seychelles and one to South Africa;- Cholera in horrific numbers in Yemen, already in almost 6 months approaching 6 years of cases in Haiti, occurring in not just drought or flooding but in the midst of overt military conflict;- Hepatitis A in the USA, in southern California and eastern Michigan, occurring in substantial numbers not related to a contamination food but rather a product of unsanitary living conditions in homeless and illicit drug user population.With global warming and climate change, continued warfare throughout the world, and the widening societal gaps in both the 1st and 3rd worlds, those of us involved in both public health and Public Health must remain ever vigilant to adapt our roles and change our paradigms to deal with these changes resulting in old and new pathogens. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181>.]******[2] South Africa ex MadagascarDate: Thu 12 Oct 2017 12:59 SASTSource: TimesLIVE [edited]<https://goo.gl/vkvNwh>A South African basketball player who had contracted plague in Madagascar has been successfully treated. The player has returned to South Africa and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) on Thu 12 Oct 2017, issued a statement saying the player does not pose any health risk. Details about the player and the team have not been established yet by TimesLIVE but the NICD is in contact with the group and has mentioned that it will follow up on them.The NICD warned South Africans traveling to Madagascar to be highly cautious of their surroundings as the country is experiencing an outbreak.According to the NICD statementÛ  the number of reported cases is 449 and 48 deaths have been recorded so far [now 500 cases and 54 deaths]. ""The outbreak is primarily located in the middle 1/3 of the islandÛ  centred around the capitalÛ  Antananarivo and Toamasina province on the east coast. A single area on the northern coast is affected. The majority of cases are presenting as pneumonic plagueÛ "" reads the statement.The NICD said plague is a zoonotic disease caused by a bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. Where plague is endemicÛ  it is usually found in rodents and is spread by fleas from rodent or to other mammals. ""South African travelers to Madagascar are advised to avoid highly populated areasÛ  avoid close contact with ill personsÛ  wear surgical masks while in transitÛ  avoid contact with rodents and dead animalsÛ "" said the NICD statement.[Byline: Bafana Nzimande]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This is the 1st report regarding the case of plague exported to South Africa from Madagascar. It is not stated what form of plague the individual had but like the fatal case in a Seychelles man who died in Madagascar, this case was related to the basketball tournament held in Madagascar. It has not been stated that the Seychelles pneumonic plague case imported from Madagascar was related to the same tournament. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179>.]******[3] Antimicrobial susceptibility questionDate: Wed 11 Oct 2017From: Allen Lenoir <alenoir165@aol.com> [edited]What is known of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the organisms isolate in this outbreak? I recall a report many years ago of a strain isolated in Madagascar that was only sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.--Allen Lenoir, MDMiami, FLUSA<alenoir165@aol.com>[Indeed, as Dr Lenoir points out, Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997;337(10):677-80, PMID: 9278464; available at <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004>). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread and it has not clearly been stated that the outbreak strain is anything but fully drug sensitive. ProMED would like information about the drug sensitivities of the outbreak isolates. - Mod.LL]
