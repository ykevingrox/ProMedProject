The Herald-Tribune, Batesville [edited]<https://goo.gl/MeHhLM>There are 2 area [Batesville, Indiana] families that have dealt with illnesses associated with mosquito-borne diseases and have struggled to find out what was wrong with their children. They hope their stories will help others in the future.The boy-------[Their] 6-year-old son ""is a very active boy,"" says his mother. ""He loves playing baseball and soccer, and he's always outside riding his bike or 4-wheeler and enjoys camping. He also enjoys adventuring into the woods and looks forward to going hunting when he gets older.""In July [2017] ... after 3 days of the boy complaining of headaches and leading into vomiting, fever, and not eating, we went to the local doctor .... Then we were in and out of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center [in Batesville] 3 times before finally being admitted.""Since doctors had not diagnosed his condition yet, the boy was put on antibiotics right away and testing began. All tests kept coming back negative, so he stayed on an antibiotic for 4 days before getting released. Children's had sent out his remaining blood and spinal fluid for further testing. A week later, they called us with the results -- positive for California encephalitis [group virus].""With the boy being so active and always outdoors, we are not aware of exactly where he was in contact with the mosquito-borne illness. He spends most of his time in Ripley and Decatur counties [Indiana]. We are fortunate that he does not need to take any further medications, and he appears to be back in good health with no side effects. I have met other families who were not as fortunate, so we are very blessed to have our healthy son back,"" the mother reveals.""We hear every day through the media to use insect repellent. I cannot express this enough on how important this is. I don't go anywhere without it, and I spray even when I don't think it's necessary. Education has improved just in the past few months on vector-borne illnesses, and I hope this continues.""She points out, ""It is very frustrating as a parent to be seen by several doctors and not get answers. Don't go home or give up. Fight for your loved ones.""The girl--------The daughter of a couple, who has 2 older siblings, was also diagnosed with California [group] encephalitis.Prior to being infected, ""the girl was very outgoing, funny, a good athlete and was able to complete her studies with ease. She enjoyed basketball and softball,"" says her mother.In 2012, at the age of 11, she started showing symptoms, which included migraine headaches, severe fatigue, leg and back pain, visual disturbances, and weight loss. It took about 2 1/2 weeks for physicians to determine what was causing her illness, her mother reports.At fist, she didn't receive any treatment, ""but about 6 months later, they (doctors) discovered she had brain damage. She then became epileptic and was treated for seizures and chronic migraines. In 2015, she underwent brain surgery to remove the damaged areas, a portion of her right temporal lobe and her whole right hippocampus. She still suffers short- and long-term memory loss, struggles with learning and things that involve 'executive function' and depression.""The infection prevention coordinator, notes, ""A virus from a mosquito bite was not the 1st or 10th thing that anyone thought about that could be causing her illness, but I knew something was wrong and felt helpless and frustrated. I just want others to be aware that this is something that is becoming more common in our area and to be aware of the signs and symptoms, so you can be an advocate for your loved one.""The girl's illness was caused by a mosquito [-transmitted virus], but there are illnesses caused by ticks, also. These illnesses have no rhyme or reason. One child can recover 100 percent, another can recover, but suffer lifelong deficits, while another child may die from it.""You can find information on how to prevent these diseases on the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website at <https://www.cdc.gov/lac/>, and through the local health department.""[Byline: Diane Raver]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the report above does not indicate with which of the California serogroup viruses these 2 children had been infected, most likely it was La Crosse virus (LACV). LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio, and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at <http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>). There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA. These cases occurred in east-central Indiana, relatively near to the Ohio focal area, so occasional occurrence of LACV infections there is not surprising. The report above does not indicate which tests were used to establish the LACV diagnosis, but they were probably serological.Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children, and cases in adults are somewhat unusual. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur, and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. Eliminating fresh water catchments that are breeding sites of _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the La Crosse virus vector mosquito, is wise. The Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ can also transmit the virus.The CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at <https://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>.An image of _O. (Aedes) triseriatus_ can be seen at <http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/details.asp?pid=2166>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63270>.]
