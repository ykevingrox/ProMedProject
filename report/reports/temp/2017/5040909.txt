Stella Lorika, the Kapoeta minister of health, told local radio that 20 people have died of cholera in the region since an outbreak was declared in April 2017. ""The cases of cholera are increasing on a daily basis in Kapoeta North County especially when it rains,"" Lorika said.In April 2017, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 172 people had died across 14 counties in South Sudan since the initial outbreak was reported in June 2016. Furthermore, in South Sudan, the 1st country to declare a famine since 2011, the UN has recorded almost 5640 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) and cholera in some parts of the country.[Byline: Parach Mach]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[2] Cholera - Somalia (South)Date: Tue 16 May 2017 11:53 AMSource: Voice of America News [edited]<https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-outbreak-somalia/3853078.html>A regional drought has displaced more than half a million people in Somalia and left the country at risk of famine. A cholera outbreak is further complicating relief efforts, in particular in the southern part of the country where some villages remain under al-Shabab control. Bay Regional Hospital, the biggest in the southwest federal state, is filled with patients suffering from stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.Cholera has sickened more than 40 000 people in Somalia since December 2016. More than half of the cases have been in this state. Most of the victims have been malnourished children.WHO cholera expert Dr Abdinasir Abubakar says the outbreak is getting worse due to security challenges. ""If you look at Bay, Bakool, Middle Juba, Gedo some of those areas where none of us is able to access, the deaths and cases due to cholera is very high, and we expect the situation will get worse,"" says Abubakar.Rains this month [May 2017] in southern and central Somalia have contributed to a surge in cholera cases, according to Bay Regional Hospital cholera treatment ward deputy supervisor Salima Sheikh Shuaib. She says ""the cholera cases were going down, but the past three days we have seen an increase in cholera cases. This morning [Tue 16 May 2017], we have received 16 cases and most of them are children under the age of 5.""Abubakar of the WHO says it is hard to contain the spread of cholera so long as the general humanitarian situation is not improving. ""We cannot only solve cholera. We cannot only deal with cholera unless we deal with food insecurity, unless we deal with water issues, malnutrition and I think collectedly both the wash, the health, the nutrition, and the food security partners we are working closely and we are coordinating but again in Somalia one of the challenges. We are facing a shortage of resources to support all these interventions,"" says Abubakar.Somalia continues to report between 200 and 300 cases of cholera nationwide each day.[Byline: Mohammed Yusuf]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>*****[3] Cholera - Somalia (Central)Date: Tue 16 May 2017Source: Anatolu Agency [edited]<http://aa.com.tr/en/africa/somalia-cholera-outbreak-death-toll-tops-700/819845>At least 11 people, including women and children, died over the last 2 days and more than 30 people were also infected after a cholera outbreak hit villages in central Somalia, pushing the death toll just over 700.[SMH], a traditional elder in the region, told Anadolu Agency over the telephone, ""The villages of Dalhis, Hodley, Halaney and Hul-adur were hard hit by the outbreak. At least 11 people died, including 8 women, 2 children, and an elder."" Dr Abdimalik Mustaf, a doctor in the region, also confirmed the death toll to Anadolu Agency.Over 13 out of 18 Somali regions have been hit by the outbreak, according to the United Nations.Somalia's drought has led to a lack of clean water, and before today's new toll, cholera had killed about 690 people in 2017, the largest outbreak of cholera Somalia has seen in the last 5 years, according to the WHO.""Drought in Somalia led to the destruction of crops and livestock, leaving more than 3.3 million hungry every day. If the current situation continues, famine could soon be a reality,"" the WHO said last week [week of Sun 7 May 2017].[Byline: Mohammed Dhaysane]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Contaminated water remains the major risk factor for the acquisition of _V. cholerae_. As reported in Africa (currently in the Horn of Africa) periods of flooding and drought increase the risk of outbreaks. As demonstrated in Haiti the introduction of cholera into a country with a destroyed sanitary system and no underlying immunity can cause a major epidemic. In the classical endemic areas such as the Indian subcontinent and other areas in Asia, rainy reasons often accentuate the number of cases. Acute watery diarrhea is often used as an alternative term for cholera, the primary cause of outbreaks of watery diarrhea with fatalities in adults. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/33523>.]
