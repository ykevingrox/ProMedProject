Dallas Morning News [edited]<https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/2017/10/11/north-texas-dairy-farm-gets-ok-resume-raw-milk-sales-bacteria-scare>The North Texas distributor whose raw milk products were recalled in August 2017 after being linked to a drug-resistant strain of bacteria has gotten the OK to resume sales. An investigation found 2 cows in K-Bar Dairy's herd were shedding _Brucella_ bacteria in their milk. The bacteria appear in the raw milk of infected animals like cows and goats. It is the most common source of human infection from drinking unpasteurized milk products. Subsequent testing has shown no further evidence of bacteria in K-bar's milk or equipment, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed in an update Wed 11 Oct 2017.K-Bar Dairy is a small, family-operated dairy farm in Wise County that produces around 120 gallons per day of raw milk, a type of milk that has not been pasteurized to kill microorganisms. Licensed raw milk distributors like K-Bar are only permitted to sell their milk and milk products on the farm; the products are not available in stores.""Milk is our livelihood,"" says K-Bar owner Kim Lambert. She and her husband, Jeff, have been in the business several decades without incident. ""Then something like this happens,"" she said Wednesday [11 Oct 2017] with a sigh. ""We're slowly starting to pick back up. But it'll take a while to earn the public's trust,"" she said. Lambert said the 2 cows that were infected with _Brucella_ had to be put down.In August 2017, a recall was issued on K-Bar's raw milk after a person who drank the product was hospitalized with symptoms of fever, joint pain and fatigue. Laboratory testing later confirmed the same strain of _Brucella_ in milk samples collected at the dairy and in the infected individual. The company is now clear to resume sales, but state health officials will periodically test its milk for _Brucella_ for up to a year.[Byline: Sabriya Rice]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from a CDC News Release from 15 Sep 2017 regarding the episode<https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0915-raw-milk-brucella.html>, which seems to be the last public notice about it. It is unclear whether any additional cases of human brucellosis did occur in Texas or other states. ProMED would like information in this regard, although according to the EpiCore participant submission from Tennessee below, one of the states listed below may be a 2nd case. There may be others.""Milk from K-Bar dairy is known to have caused _Brucella_ infection in one Texas resident. An illness in a Texas woman has been linked to the dairy. Purchase records and illness reports indicate additional people in Texas and some as far away as California and North Dakota may need antimicrobials to prevent or treat infection. In Texas, raw milk is only allowed to be sold on site at the dairy. According to Texas DHSH, K-Bar dairy has been operating in compliance with state dairy laws and rules and is cooperating fully with the investigation.CDC and Texas health officials have been trying to reach people in more than 800 households known to have purchased K-Bar raw milk. Texas is following up with 170; CDC tried to contact the remaining 672 households, but many did not provide contact information. Of the 485 households with contact information, CDC successfully reached 236 households. Among the 236 households, 83 percent of people were exposed to RB51 by drinking the milk. Due to incomplete contact information, CDC staff have been unable to reach about 200 households in which someone bought K-Bar milk. People who sampled the milk at the dairy or got the milk from friends or family also may not be aware of their risk. So far, CDC and Texas health officials have received reports about people who drank K-Bar milk or have symptoms consistent with brucellosis caused by RB51 in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Ohio, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.About RB51----------RB51 is a weakened strain of _B. abortus_ used to vaccinate young female cattle against infection with more serious strains of _Brucella_. Vaccinating cows with the RB51 vaccine helps prevent abortions in cows and reduces the risk of people coming into contact with cows infected with more severe strains. However, in rare cases, vaccinated cows can shed RB51 in their milk.Testing of milk from the individual cows in the dairy herd revealed 2 cows that were infected with _B. abortus_ RB51, supporting the conclusion that these cows are a source of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. Testing is ongoing by Texas officials to assure that the remaining cows in the herd do not pose an ongoing risk of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. The only way to avoid this potential exposure is to drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill the germs.Brucellosis is rare in the USA, largely due to our vaccination practices in cattle to prevent brucellosis. There are about 120 reported cases in people each year. Most cases of brucellosis in the USA occur in people who traveled to countries where brucellosis is more common and drank contaminated cow, sheep or goat milk or had contact with infected animals. Among cases in the USA who acquired brucellosis here, infections occur from contact with feral swine or, more rarely, dogs, or because of accidental exposure in lab settings.Raw Milk: a Risk for Infections-----------------------Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs. CDC recommends that people only drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill germs. Even healthy animals may carry germs that can contaminate milk. There is no substitute for pasteurization to assure that milk is safe to drink. The risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs."" - Mod.LL]******[2] EpiCore ReportDate: Thu 12 Oct 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]On approximately 1 Sep 2017, _Brucella_ (species not known) was cultured from a patient at Regional One Medical Center in Memphis, TN. Exposure of lab personnel to the organism was reported to the CDC; however, no adverse results have been noted in the health of these persons. One individual was offered antimicrobial prophylaxis and did not accept it.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for this report.It is not stated whether the patient had indeed ingested unpasteurized milk from the K-Bar Dairy, but Tennessee is one of the states listed above for concern of additional cases. Also, brucellosis is an uncommon human infection in the USA, and in the last year that I could find statistics for (2010 - <https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/resources/surveillance.html>), only 1 human brucellosis infection was reported. ProMED would appreciate learning about additional reports. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
