Avian Flu Diary [edited]<http://afludiary.blogspot.fr/2017/03/rosselkhoznadzor-avian-flu-outbreak-in.html>This being flu season, the finding of some workers with flu symptoms is hardly unexpected, and they may be completely unrelated to the outbreak. But when there has been history of exposure to infected birds, all cases must be checked out.First stop, a report from Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor). On detection of avian influenza virus in Sergiev Posad municipal district of Moscow region.As a result of laboratory tests of samples of pathological material taken from dead birds contained in the territory of FSUE [Federal State Unitary Enterprise] HAG SGC ""Smena"" Sergiev Posad municipal district of Moscow region, identified the genetic material of bird flu. The preliminary diagnosis established [1 Mar 2017] BS MO ""Moscow Regional Veterinary Laboratory"". Virus samples of pathological material were sent to FGBU ""ARRIAH"" [Federal Center for Animal Health]. As a result of studies conducted by RT-PCR in a sample of poultry viscera, avian influenza A subtype H5 was identified. Further molecular genetic and virological studies will be carried out.At the time of onset of the disease the company had 200 000 birds, including 150 000 adult birds, [of which 6500 died].According to the information provided by the FSUE HAG SGC ""Smena"" to the register of veterinary certificates issued in the period from 6 Feb 2017 to 1 Mar 2017, the company shipped products to the territories of Vladimir, Tambov, and Moscow regions. The information was sent to the relevant territorial departments of the Rosselkhoznadzor, the subject veterinary departments and the Rospotrebnadzor Administration, to take measures to prevent the spread of infection.Currently, the State Veterinary Service of Moscow Region is carrying out complex organizational, economic, and veterinary-sanitary measures, in accordance with the Order no. 90 of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation of 27 Mar 2006 ""On Approval of the Regulations on Avian Influenza Control"".This statement from the Russian Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) for the Moscow Region, deals more with the prevention of human infection with the virus:Preventive measures-------------------The Office of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) in the Moscow Region informs about the registration of an epizootic fowl of avian influenza in FGBU SCHS ""Smena"" of the Sergiev Posad Municipal District of the Moscow Region since the beginning of March 2017.Specialists of the Department of Rospotrebnadzor in the Moscow Region organized a complex of anti-epidemic and preventive measures aimed at preventing the spread of infection among people, including house-to-house visits and daily medical supervision of contact persons, education of the population about the rules for keeping poultry, control over the sale of agricultural products (poultry, poultry eggs), and the destruction of all deceased poultry.Under the administration of the Sergiev Posad Municipal District, an operational headquarters has been established to eliminate the outbreak. The Office of Rospotrebnadzor for the Moscow region recommends the following prevention measures:- it is necessary to avoid contact with domestic and wild birds in households, markets, and places of mass accumulation of poultry in open reservoirs, poultry farming should be conducted only on private households;- it is not recommended to buy poultry meat or eggs in places of unauthorized trade in the territories where avian influenza is registered;- the eggs must be treated with the utmost care, washed with a warm 0.5 per cent solution of soda ash, disinfected with 0.5 per cent chloramine solution or 2 per cent bleach solution (or other detergents and disinfectants authorized for this purpose), rinsed with cold running water for at least 5 minutes, followed by storing in a clean container;- it is recommended to heat poultry meat at a temperature not lower than 70 deg  √Å [60 deg F], eggs should be cooked for at least 6 minutes.[...]Symptoms of avian influenza in humans-------------------------------------The incubation period of avian influenza may be longer than that of normal seasonal influenza, and lasts on average 5 days (from 2 to 8 days, possibly even up to 17 days).The disease begins acutely with chills, fever of 38 deg C [100.4 deg F] or higher, muscle pain, headaches, sore throat, possibly watery diarrhea, and frequent vomiting. The condition deteriorates rapidly. After 2-3 days there is a moist cough, often mixed with blood, and shortness of breath. Damage to the liver, kidneys, and brain is possible.At the appearance of the 1st signs of the disease, it is necessary to urgently consult a doctor for diagnosis and timely treatment, since a delay inevitably leads to the development of complications.While I've yet to locate an official statement, Russian media also reports as many as 14 people have been hospitalized or placed in quarantine due to possible exposure and/or symptoms.Although human infection is possible -- even with H5N8 -- all of this may prove nothing more than the prudent exercise of an abundance of caution.From the Interfax News Agency [5 Mar 2017]------------------------------------------More than 10 people in the suburbs were placed in quarantine due to the outbreak of avian influenza. About 14 people in the suburbs are under medical supervision because of the outbreak of avian influenza, told ""Interfax"" on [Sun 4 Mar 2017], said a source familiar with the situation.""In Pushkin and Sergiev Posad districts, 7 people are in observation,"" said the official, noting that these people are healthy, but are isolated and being monitored. Another 7 persons are in quarantine in Shchelkovo district, ""all with clinical signs of ARVI [acute respiratory viral infection],"" said the agency's spokesperson.Earlier it was reported that an outbreak of avian flu was recorded in the Moscow region. According to a source familiar with the situation, the outbreaks were detected at two poultry farms near Moscow: in Schelkovo and Sergiev Posad districts. Preliminary information indicates that, ""according to various estimates, between 400 000 to 4 million birds have been slaughtered.""Information on cases of infection with avian influenza in the poultry farm ""Smena"" is confirmed by the administration of the Sergiev Posad Municipal District. ""A few days ago, birds began to die in the poultry farm and the experts determined that some of the population is infected with the bird flu virus."" A careful analysis identified the strain H5N8, which according to virologists, is not dangerous for humans, but highly pathogenic for poultry. ""Safety measures at the farm and in the quarantine zone of several kilometers, are strengthened,"" said a statement on the official website of the administration.""Now specialists are monitoring all poultry farms in the district, including small private farms, which work around the clock, in the event of an epidemic that would threaten the unique gene pool of the Smena poultry farm, which was formed over decades, and large losses are also likely in the agricultural sector,"" the statement said.There are no official comments on the situation in Schelkovo district yet.This media story, as well as others, already peg the virus as H5N8, while Rosselkhoznadzor states genetic analysis is still ongoing. Hopefully we'll get clarification on all of these issues in the next day or 2.[byline: Michael Coston]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Avian influenza A(H5N8) viruses have been rapidly spreading, most likely via wild migratory birds in Asia and Europe in recent months, and causing deaths in wild birds and outbreaks in domestic poultry. During 2014, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage were detected in wild birds and poultry in China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, and the UK. The virus was then detected in North America in late 2014 and was detected sporadically in Canada and the United States of America (USA) in wild birds and poultry until mid-2015. A(H5N8) viruses were also detected in Taiwan, China, and in Hungary and Sweden in 2015.According to the WHO report on current human risk of the avian influenza A(H5N8) virus, human infection with the A(H5N8) virus cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is low, based on the limited information obtained to date (<http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/riskassessment_AH5N8_201611/en/>).To date, no human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N8) have been detected. However, human cases of infection with related clade 2.3.4.4 A(H5N6) viruses have been detected and reported in China. Though human infections with A(H5) viruses are rare and generally occur in individuals exposed to sick or dead infected birds (or their environments), they can lead to severe illness or death in humans. Following outbreaks of influenza A(H5N8)/A(H5N2) in the USA, information on individuals with exposure to infected birds was collected, but no evidence of human infection with influenza A(H5) was detected among the persons involved in the study [Arriola CS, Nelson DI, Deliberto TJ, et al: Infection risk for persons exposed to highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5 virus-infected birds, United States, December 2014-March 2015. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015; 21(12): 2135-40; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4672413/>].Since June 2016, countries in both Europe and Asia have detected infections in wild birds and/or domestic poultry with A(H5N8) including Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, India, Israel, Netherlands, Poland, Russian Federation, and Switzerland. Many of these recent detections were associated with mortality in wild birds. Further spread along the migratory route of wild birds is likely, and introduction into other countries could occur.Information received from the ProMED-Russian moderator:""120 persons are now under medical supervision -- it is only a control measure (not quarantine); they don't' present 'flu' symptoms; samples were taken from 7 people and among them, all results are negative for avian influenza.""Any further information on these cases would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58650>.]
