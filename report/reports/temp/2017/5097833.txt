Lancet Planet Health 2017; 1: e97-104]----------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-------Background. The emergence of human malaria due to the monkey parasite _Plasmodium knowlesi_ threatens elimination efforts in southeast Asia. Changes in land use are thought to be driving the rise in reported _P. knowlesi_ cases, but the role of individual-level factors is unclear. To address this knowledge gap we assessed human and environmental factors associated with zoonotic [_P. knowlesi_] malaria risk.Methods. We did this population-based case-control study over a 2 year period in the state of Sabah in Malaysia. We enrolled cases with microscopy-positive, PCR-confirmed malaria who presented to 2 primary referral hospitals serving the adjacent districts of Kudat and Kota Marudu. We randomly selected 3 malaria-negative community controls per case, who were matched by village within 2 weeks of case detection. We obtained questionnaire data on demographics, behaviour, and residential malaria risk factors, and we also assessed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity. We used conditional logistic regression models to evaluate exposure risk between _P. knowlesi_ cases and controls, and between _P. knowlesi_ and human-only _Plasmodium_ spp malaria cases.Findings. From [5 Dec 2012], to [30 Jan 2015] we screened 414 patients and subsequently enrolled 229 cases with _P knowlesi_ malaria mono-infection and 91 cases with other _Plasmodium_ spp infection. We enrolled 953 matched controls, including 683 matched to _P knowlesi_ cases and 270 matched to non-_P knowlesi_ cases. Age 15 years or older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.16, 95 percent CI 2.09-8.29, p<0.0001), male gender (4.20, 2.54-6.97, p<0.0001), plantation work (3.50, CI, 1.34-9.15, p=0.011), sleeping outside (3.61, 1.48-8.85, p=0.0049), travel (2.48, 1.45-4.23, p=0.0010), being aware of the presence of monkeys in the past 4 weeks (3.35, 1.91-5.88, p<0.0001), and having open eaves or gaps in walls (2.18, 1.33-3.59, p=0.0021) were independently associated with increased risk of symptomatic _P knowlesi_ infection. Farming occupation (aOR 1.89, 95 percent CI 1.07-3.35, p=0.028), clearing vegetation (1.89, 1.11-3.22, p=0.020), and having long grass around the house (2.08, 1.25-3.46, p=0.0048) increased risk for _P knowlesi_ infection but no other _Plasmodium_ spp infection. G6PD deficiency seemed to be protective against _P knowlesi_ (aOR 0.20, 95 percent CI 0.04-0.96, p=0.045), as did residual insecticide spraying of household walls (0.52, 0.31-0.87, p=0.014), with the presence of young sparse forest (0.35, 0.20-0.63, [p=0.0040]) and rice paddy around the house (0.16, 0.03-0.78, 0.023) also associated with decreased risk.Interpretation. Adult men working in agricultural areas were at highest risk of [_P. knowlesi_] malaria, although peri-domestic transmission also occurs. Human behavioural factors associated with _P knowlesi_ transmission could be targeted in future public health interventions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The study was done in Sabah, Malaysia, which has had the highest recorded rates of _P. knowlesi_ infection globally. The study reports significant heterogeneity in co-transmission of _P. knowlesi_ and other _Plasmodium_ species. The results suggest that control strategies against other malaria species than _P. knowlesi_ works have less effect on _P. knowlesi_ infections.This is perhaps expected as _P. knowlesi_ in the only human malaria species with a well-defined animal reservoir, the _Macaca fascicularis_ (the long-tailed or crab-eating macaque) and _M. nemestrina_ (the pig-tailed or Southern pig-tailed macaque). Thus the transmission dynamics is very much different from the human to human transmission of the other 4 human malaria parasites without an animal reservoir, and depend on the proximity of the monkey reservoir to humans. Also, the vector dynamics are not well known and as pointed out in the comments to the paper, the longevity of the vector is not known, and probably the flight range also. The study suggests that exposure during work in fields close to forest or forest fringes is a risk factor, and thus protection could be through insecticide impregnated in clothes.It is still not established if human-to-human transmission is an important epidemiological factor. _P. knowlesi_ DNA has been found in mosquitoes co-infected with other _plasmodia_ as well as _P. knowlesi_ gametocyte mRNA in humans (Maeno Y et al: _Plasmodium knowlesi_ and human malaria parasites in Khan Phu, Vietnam: Gametocyte production in humans and frequent co-infection of mosquitoes. Parasitology. 2017; 144(4): 527-35. doi: 10.1017/S0031182016002110; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27894375>). This makes it likely that human-to-human transmission can occur, but the difference in the effect of control measures found in the Lancet Planet Health study may indicate that different _Anopheles_ vectors with different habits are involved. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3969>.]
