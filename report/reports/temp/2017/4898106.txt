The blood sample will be taken from the child,"" Subuh said. If the test proved negative, it would mean that the father was also tested negative for bird flu and vice versa.Cirebon Agriculture Office head Ali Efendi said that his office can only vaccinate 75 000 out of 3 million birds in Cirebon District. ""Vaccination process is ongoing. But we have not done it in Pangenan,"" Ali said.On bird flu cases, Ali said that 105 ducks in Pangenan sub-district had been tested positive for bird flu.

However, no outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in animals (H5 and H7) has been notified to OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) from Indonesia in 2017 (<http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2017/>).Both cases described above had contact with bird flu positive birds (possibly ducks) and the father of one of the cases (a child) died of suspected avian influenza but the article does not provide details on this case.Further information on the suspected cases from knowledgeable sources in the region would be appreciated. - Mod.UBAMaps of Indonesia can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Indonesia.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58758>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
