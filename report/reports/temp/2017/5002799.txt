The only thing we have ruled out is ... Ebola,"" said Liberia's Chief Medical Officer Francis Kateh, adding samples from the victims had been sent abroad for further testing.On [Wed 26 Apr 2017], the WHO said Liberian health authorities were taking rapid precautionary steps after 8 people died of a mystery illness, 10 months after the end of a 2-year Ebola virus outbreak.""It seems all of these people were attending the funeral of a religious leader,"" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a briefing in Geneva.""They have taken samples from the dead bodies and all the samples came back negative for Ebola. They will be looking of course for other hemorrhagic fevers and for bacteria, if there was any common exposure to water contamination or food contamination,"" she said.Up to 5 people remain under observation in hospital in Sinoe county, a 4-hour drive southeast of the capital Monrovia, and 4 have been discharged, Kateh said. The symptoms include fever, vomiting and diarrhea, said Chaib.Hospital staff is wearing protective equipment and contacts of the sick are being traced in the community to see if they have fallen ill, she added.""WHO, CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control) and other partners are providing technical and logistical support to the rapid response team that has been activated at district and county levels,"" Chaib said.In June last year [2016], the WHO declared Liberia free of active Ebola virus transmission, the last of 3 West African countries at the epicenter of the world's worst outbreak of the disease. The epidemic killed more than 11 300 people and infected some 28 600 from 2013 as it swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to WHO data.A WHO advisory group of vaccine experts is due later on [Fri 28 Apr 2017] to issue their findings after a 3-day regular meeting on vaccines. The statement would include an update on ""efficacy, safety and timelines for licensing Ebola vaccines"", Chaib said.[Byline: Stephanie Nebehay]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The death toll raises again by one, to 11. Apparently, there is no transmission since no new cases are reported. Presumably, the new deaths after the original 8 are those who have been hospitalized. The results of the laboratory tests are awaited with interest.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Liberia can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41137>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41137>.]
