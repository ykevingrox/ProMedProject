A teenage girl and a man in his 80s had symptoms of food poisoning, including diarrhea, after eating separately at the restaurant Anrakutei on 30 Jul 2017. Both were hospitalized and are recovering, according to the local government. The O157 strain of the bacterium was found at the restaurant outlet or from the employees, it said.The announcement followed an outbreak of _E. coli_ food poisoning in Gunma and Saitama prefectures this week [week of Aug 2017]. The city of Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, conducted on-site inspections at a food processing plant after potato salad produced there infected 12 people in the 2 prefectures, including a 5 year old girl who became gravely ill and temporarily lost consciousness. During the inspections, officials looked into the manufacturing processes at the plant, which shipped the potato salad that found its way to delicatessens in Gunma and Saitama prefectures, according to the city.Officials also took samples of the salad made during the same period to conduct further tests. The Takasaki Municipal Government later announced that no _E. coli_ bacteria had been found from the samples. The operator of the businesses, based in Ota, Gunma, sold bagged potato salad shipped from the plant after mixing it with ham and apple pieces, according to the Saitama Prefectural Government.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information about the Yokohama cases (Yokohama is the capital city of Kanagawa prefecture) and to know if they are linked to the cases, now 12 in all, in Saitama and Gunma Prefectures. - Mod.LLMaps of Japan can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/cities_of_japan_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9764>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
