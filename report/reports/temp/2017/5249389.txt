Eurosurveillance Volume 22, Issue 32 [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22854>Summary:Over the summers of 2015 and 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) reported outbreaks of the intestinal disease cyclosporiasis in travellers returning from Mexico, mainly from the Riviera Maya and Cancun regions. As the source of the outbreaks was not identified, there is the potential for a similar outbreak to reoccur.As of 27 Jul 2017, 78 cases had already been reported in the UK in 2017, of which 37 (47%) had travelled to Mexico; 20 were awaiting travel history; 14 had travelled to 9 other overseas destinations, and 7 reported no overseas travel. We describe and discuss actions taken in advance of an anticipated outbreak during the summer of 2017.Conclusion:Based on the previous UK cyclosporiasis outbreaks, we recommend other European countries to (i) assess, and increase if necessary, Cyclospora laboratory testing and reporting capacity; (ii) increase cyclosporiasis risk awareness among travellers to Mexico; (iii) report cyclosporiasis cases early; and (iv) collaborate in outbreak investigations to identify possible sources and to assess the extent of the outbreak.ReferenceDFP Marques et al.

The authors of the report in Eurosurveillance suggest better surveillance and investigations, and one tool is to make infections with _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ a reportable disease.Most reports of infections reported by ProMED so far have been linked to contaminated food, and the outbreaks from Canada and the United States have often been multi-state. - Mod.EPProMED HealthMaps:United Kingdom: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>Mexico: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14>]
