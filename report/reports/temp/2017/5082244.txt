Pre-travel advice had not been sought and no pre-travel vaccinations received nor had he a prior history of vaccination for Japanese encephalitis. He travelled to Phuket, Thailand in early May [2017] (day 1 of trip) and stayed at a resort. While in Phuket, he became lethargic on day 8 of the trip. He travelled to Bangkok on day 10 and returned to Australia on day 13. During the 4 days in Bangkok he continued to be lethargic, slept for several hours each day, had poor appetite and was sweaty. There was no report of headaches or confusion. Multiple mosquito bites were noted. There was no report of animal contacts nor of travel to rural regions.On return to Australia he presented to the local hospital on day 14 (from the beginning of his trip) with confusion. A lumbar puncture on day 15 demonstrated glucose 3.5 mmol/L (2.2 - 3.9), protein 1.3 g/L (<0.45), polymorphs 280 x 10^6/L, lymphocytes 90 x 10^6/L and red blood cells of 54 x 10^6/L. An opening pressure was not recorded. He was commenced on broad spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir. Due to ongoing confusion and increasing stupor he was intubated on day 15 and transferred to a tertiary hospital (Royal Melbourne Hospital). Neurological examination upon arrival revealed flaccid paralysis of all muscle groups. An MRI brain demonstrated no abnormalities. Seizure activity was noted on day 17 and anti-seizure medication commenced. Diagnostic PCR assays on the initial and a repeat LP (on day 18) were negative for herpes viruses (HSV1, HSV2, VZV), enterovirus, flavivirus (primers for pan-flavivirus PCR), respiratory viruses (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, picornavirus, adenovirus, coronavirus), meningococcus, and pneumococcus. HIV and syphilis serology were negative. Bacterial cultures were negative and screening swabs for _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ were negative.On day 22, serology results from serum obtained on days 15, 20, and 21 were all positive for Japanese encephalitis virus IgM and IgG. IgG titres for Japanese encephalitis virus rose across the serial bleeds: 160 on day 15, 1280 on day 20 and more than 2560 on day 21. Murray Valley encephalitis serology (total antibody) from the day 15 specimen was weakly positive but negative on day 20 and 21 specimens. Dengue virus serology was IgM, IgG and NS1 antigen negative. IgG and IgM for Japanese encephalitis virus were detectable in the CSF obtained on day 18. Urine collected on day 23 was PCR positive for pan-flavivirus and Japanese encephalitis virus specific targets.As of day 24, he remains on ventilatory support, obeys commands at times, and has a flaccid paralysis.--communicated by:Dr Shio Yen Tio, Dr Khai Lin Huang, Associate Professor Steven TongOn behalf of the Victorian Infectious Disease Service, the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and the University of Melbourne, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, AustraliaVictorian Infectious Diseases Reference LaboratoryThe Royal Melbourne Hospital and the University of MelbourneThe Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, Australia[Although ProMED-mail posted a single case of a JE virus acquired in Thailand previously, it is endemic in Thailand, so the occurrence of this case, although unusual, is not surprising. The specific location where the patient acquired his JE virus infection in Thailand was Phuket, a very popular tourist destination. Dr Steven Tong indicated that, as far as he knew, travel was direct from Australia to Phuket, eliminating the possibility of exposure during an intermediate stop. Visitors to rural areas in Thailand are well advised to take the precautions recommended by the US CDC (<https://www.cdc.gov/japaneseencephalitis/prevention/index.html>):""Avoid mosquito bites:- use insect repellent. When you go outdoors, use an EPA-registered insect repellent such as those containing DEET, IR3535, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Even a short time outdoors can be long enough to get a mosquito bite. For more information about insect repellents, see Protection against Mosquitoes, Ticks, and Other Insects & Arthropods;- wear proper clothing to reduce mosquito bites. When weather permits, wear long-sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so treating clothes with repellent containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent will give extra protection. Don't apply repellents containing permethrin directly to skin;- reduce exposure to mosquitoes during peak biting hours. The mosquitoes that transmit JE virus feed mainly outside during the cooler hours from dusk to dawn. Travelers to high risk areas should consider minimizing outdoor activities at these times if possible. To reduce the risk of JE and other vectorborne diseases, travelers should stay in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms, or use a bed net and aerosol room insecticides.Obtain vaccine if recommended:JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend one month or more in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. This includes long-term travelers, recurrent travelers, or expatriates who will be based in urban areas but are likely to visit endemic rural or agricultural areas during a high-risk period of JE virus transmission.Vaccine should also be considered for the following:- Short-term (less than one month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of JE virus exposure. Examples of higher-risk activities or itineraries include: 1) spending substantial time outdoors in rural or agricultural areas, especially during the evening or night; 2) participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming); and 3) staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.- travelers to an area with an ongoing JE outbreak;- travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific destinations, activities, or duration of travel.JE vaccine is not recommended for short-term travelers whose visits will be restricted to urban areas or times outside a well-defined JE virus transmission season.""The specific localities in the Phuket area where the individual had been or activities that might have exposed him to the bite of JEV infected mosquitoes is not stated. Although the risk of acquiring a clinical JEV infection during visits of a few days in a JEV endemic area is quite low, the consequences of being infected by this virus can be very serious, as illustrated by the above case. Travelers should be advised of the risk sufficiently prior to travel so that should they elect to be vaccinated, the vaccine can be applied early enough to provide protection on arrival.Drs David Hamer and Karin Leder as well as Dr Shio Yen Tio, Dr Khai Lin Huang and Associate Professor Steven Tong are thanked for providing this report. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151>.][See Also:2013---Japanese encephalitis - China (03): (HK) ex Thailand 20130905.1925722].................................................mpp/sh/ty/ec/sh"
