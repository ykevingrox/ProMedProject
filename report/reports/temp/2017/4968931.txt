The document explains that of the tamaulipecos patients of this year [2017], 5472 are men and 6412 are women.Conjunctivitis has as symptoms blurred vision, eye pain, irritation and sandy sensation in the eyes, tearing, itching and redness of eyes, and sensitivity to light. The disease can be transmitted by bacteria and viruses. In addition, there is the allergic conjunctivitis, which occurs when the conjunctiva becomes inflamed due to reaction to pollen, dandruff, mold or other substances that cause allergy.If you have symptoms, you should go to your doctor to receive proper treatment and avoid self-medication.[Byline: Ricardo Brussolo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Conjunctivitis, also known as pinkeye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the thin clear tissue that lies over the white part of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelid <http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-health-conjunctivitis#1>.The most common causes of conjunctivitis are viruses, bacteria or allergens. It can also be caused by chemicals, contact lens wear (especially wearing lenses overnight), foreign bodies in the eye (like a loose eyelash) indoor and outdoor air pollution caused, for example, by chemical vapors, fumes, smoke, or dust, and by fungi <https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/about/causes.html>. It can be difficult to determine the exact cause of conjunctivitis because some symptoms may be the same no matter the cause.Viral conjunctivitis is caused by infection of the eye(s) with a viral pathogen. It is highly contagious and may be caused by a number of different viruses, such as adenoviruses. Sometimes viral conjunctivitis can result in large outbreaks such as the one mentioned above, but it is largely dependent on the virus.In contrast to viral eye infections, bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by certain bacteria including _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus pneumonia_, _Haemophilus_ species, or, less commonly, _Chlamydia trachomatis_. It is also very contagious, and is often the leading cause of daycare or school absenteeism among children as it is more common in kids than in adults.Clinically, viral conjunctivitis causes a watery discharge, while the discharge from bacterial conjunctivitis contains pus. An eye swab can also determine the cause of the infection.The report above does not specify any suspected causes, or clinical spectrum of the cases, but the high number of cases indicates that infectious etiology is more likely. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/511>.]
