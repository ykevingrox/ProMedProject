EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited][re: ProMED-mail Foodborne illness - Ukraine: (LV) smoked fish, RFI 20170926.5342314]----------------------------------------------------------------------This information is from my colleagues from Lviv who [treated] some patients:1. Source of infection: hot smoked mackerel.2. All the diseased bought this fish in one market, from one manufacturer.3. The manufacturer did not have a license. He took frozen mackerel, defrosted it and smoked it in his garage.4. According to preliminary data, _Salmonella_ was isolated from a piece of this fish (the species is not specified).5. Most patients have typical symptoms of intestinal infection: vomiting, diarrhea, fever. None of the patients have eye or neurological disorders, which could be evidence of botulism.Conclusion: for the data, this is a case of foodborne illness (salmonellosis?) associated with fish.The fish may have been contaminated during storage or during cooking (a violation of technology)There are currently no data on botulism.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for the updated information. _Salmonella_ has apparently been isolated from the smoked fish but no information is yet reported regarding clinical isolates. As noted, since salmonellae are not normal flora in fish, the contamination is most likely to have occurred after harvesting. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9359>.]
