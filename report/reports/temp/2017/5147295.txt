Corpus Christi Caller-Times [edited<http://www.caller.com/story/news/local/2017/06/29/vibrio-victim-hospitalized/440375001/>Reports of an Ingleside teacher infected with _Vibrio vulnificus_ while wade fishing near Rockport indicate the man is being treated at a Corpus Christi hospital. Other than this information, San Patricio County Health Director Dr. James Mobley said he only can confirm there is a pending case of _Vibrio_ and that it involves a serious infection. ""It's bad,"" he said.A science teacher has contracted the infection earlier this week and was being treated at Corpus Christi Medical Center-Doctors Regional Hospital, according to hospital officials._Vibrio vulnificus_, often referred to as a flesh-eating bacterium, is naturally occurring in warm coastal waters around the world and is present in the Gulf of Mexico year-round. Levels of the microorganism are highest during warmer months. So far in 2017, reported cases of _Vibrio_ infections total 59, according to Christine Mann, with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. Of those cases, 25 percent of the infections were blood borne from an open wound, 22 percent came from consuming raw shellfish and 44 percent are from an unknown or unreported cause, Mann said._Vibrio_ cannot penetrate healthy skin. But if this insidious microbe enters the bloodstream through a break in the skin, the infection can spread rapidly and result in amputation or death. Immediate treatment is the most effective cure. The worst cases and nearly all deaths from _Vibrio_ usually involve high-risk patients who are elderly or with liver problems, diabetes, hepatitis, gastric disorders, cancer or steroid dependency; but not always. Alcoholism and a compromised immune system also are high risk factors.[Byline: David Sikes]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245>.]
