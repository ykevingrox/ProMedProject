Rajkot chief district health officer (CDHO) Dr V H Pathak said that the man had come to the Rajkot civil hospital on [Fri 21 Jul 2017] from Shivrajpur village of Jasdan with high fever. .""His samples were sent for testing for diseases including CCHF virus."" Pathak said that the test results, which arrived on [Tue 25 Jul 2017] evening, stated that he was positive for CCHF virus. This is 1st case of the dreaded CCHF this year [2017] in Rajkot. Last year [2016] also, CCHF case was reported from Jasdan taluka of the district.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by a tick-borne virus _Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_ (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/>). Wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats are the hosts of the CCHF virus. Animals get infected by the bite of infected ticks, primarily ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_. Humans are infected by tick bites or through contact with blood or tissues of infected animals during and immediately after slaughtering. Human-to-human infection occurs when there is close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of an infected person. Hospital-acquired infections occur through use of inadequately sterilized medical equipment, contaminated medical supplies, and reuse of needles.The incubation period is usually 1-3 days (maximum 9 days) following a tick bite and 5-6 days (maximum 13 days) for human-to-human infection. Clinical features include sudden onset of fever, myalgia (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sore throat may also be present followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. Sleepiness, depression, lassitude, and hepatomegaly may ensue after 2-4 days. Tachycardia, lymphadenopathy, and signs of hemorrhage also appear. Severe illness leads to rapid deterioration of kidney function, sudden liver or pulmonary failure after the 5th day of the illness. CCHF has around 30 percent mortality. There is no specific treatment for CCHF. General supportive care for the symptoms is the main management. There is currently no vaccine available for human or animals. Measures to reduce the risk of tick-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission will help in prevention and control of CCHF.The 1st cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were reported in Gujarat state of India in January 2011, resulting in 3 deaths in confirmed and suspected cases of CCHF, which included 2 health care workers (<http://www.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/topics/cchf/en/>). - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/302>.]
