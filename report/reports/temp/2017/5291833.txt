Eagle Country [edited]<http://eaglecountryonline.com/local-article/human-case-of-mosquito-virus-found-in-ripley-co/>A human case of a mosquito-borne illness has been confirmed in Ripley County.A person in Ripley County has tested positive for California serogroup virus, the Indiana State Department of Health reports. That category of viruses can include LaCrosse virus, California encephalitis, keystone virus, Jamestown Canyon virus, snowshoe hare virus, and trivattatus.It is the 1st such case found in either humans or mosquitoes this year [2017].People infected with California serogroup viruses may have no apparent symptoms. Some people have symptoms of illness that may range from mild fever to encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, according to the health department. In rare cases, the illnesses can cause long-term disability or death.The recommendations for reducing the likelihood of contracting a California serogroup virus are much the same as avoiding West Nile virus. Use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants when outdoors, and prevent standing water as mosquito breeding grounds on your property.[Byline: Mike Perleberg]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Of the California serogroup viruses mentioned above, La Crosse or Jamestown Canyon seem to be the most likely in Indiana. The age of the infected person is not mentioned. Most cases of La Crosse encephalitis involve preschool age children. Jamestown Canyon virus can cause encephalitis in adults. Both are transmitted by _Ochleratatus (Aedes)_ mosquitoes but of different species. Both viruses can circulate in the same area at the same time.Interestingly, the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito, also known as an Asian tiger mosquito, has been trapped recently in Madison County, Indiana. Although the mosquito vector of La Crosse virus is refractory to infection by Jamestown Canyon virus and vice versa, _Aedes albopictus_, however, is susceptible to both viruses and can transmit them. Moreover, all possible reassorted viruses can result when a mosquito has dual infection with both viruses.The state of Indiana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20885>, and a map showing Indiana counties can be found at <http://geology.com/county-map/indiana.shtml>. - Mod.TY]
