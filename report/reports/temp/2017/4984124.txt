Unsafe Foods [edited]<http://www.unsafefoods.com/2017/04/19/concerning-e-coli-outbreak-strikes-cave-city-sharp-county-arkansas/>A community in Sharp County, Arkansas is grappling with a possible outbreak of _E. coli_ from a mystery source after a child has died and another battles for his life at a local children's Hospital. The Spring River Chronicle reports that the child has undergone surgery and dialysis and appears to be recovering as of [Tue 18 Apr 2017]. The child's aunt informed the media that the child was released from the Intensive Care Unit on [Sat 15 Apr 2017]. The Cave City, AK toddler who recently died reportedly had the same type of infection. Local health departments have not yet confirmed whether the 2 cases are linked and have not issued any statements regarding a potential source, the type of E. coli involved, or the parameters of an investigation.The local media reported on its Facebook page, that there are reports of another child, a teenager, with an _E. coli_ diagnosis. That would make 3 children in the community severely sick without any answers about what caused their illnesses.What Kind of _E. coli_ Could Cause This?The media reported that the child fell ill last week [week of 9 Apr 2017] and was rushed to the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. Arkansas Department of Health and the Sharp County Health Unit have not yet issued statements concerning the potential outbreak. The exact strain of _E. coli_ involved in these cases can only be speculated at this time.Although the media have not reported the child's symptoms, it appears from the treatment reported that the child developed a rare, but very severe complication of _E. coli_ infections - hemolytic uremic syndrome. Hemolytic syndrome is a severe complication of the most dangerous forms of _E. coli_ - Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_(EHEC)]. The CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] report on their website state that:""The most commonly identified EHEC infections in North America are _E. coli_ O157:H7 (often shortened to _E. coli_ O157 or even just O157). When you hear news reports about outbreaks of _E. coli_ infections, they are usually talking about E. coli O157.""However, there is other non-O157 EHEC as well, including O26, O111, O121, O45, and O145. In the past, these strains were difficult to find, as there was little research done on them. According to a recent study by L. H. Gould, this is shifting because ""Non-O157 EHEC infections are being recognized with greater frequency because of changing laboratory practices.""The Concerns of Children with _E. coli_ InfectionsIt is widely known that _E. coli_ can infect anyone, regardless of age, health status, or location. However, children are one of the most susceptible groups to _E. coli_ infection with severe symptoms and complications. In instances such as this potential outbreak, where an EHEC pathogen is the likely culprit and children are involved, the prevalence for severe complications is a real concern: According to the CDC, ""Around 5-10 percent of those who are diagnosed with _E. coli_ O157 infection develop a potentially life-threatening complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).""The infection in a child can start relatively mildly, usually with some nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In most _E. coli_ infections, the victim will also suffer from severe watery diarrhea, which may progress to become bloody. Some children may also exhibit a low-grade fever. As symptoms become worse, the early onset of HUS is usually seen through its own group of additional symptoms. These can include: decreased urination, pallor (an unhealthy pale appearance to the skin), fatigue and irritability, confusion, seizures, high blood pressure, unexplained bruising, bleeding from the nose and/or mouth, and edema (swelling of the hands, feet, face, or entire body). The Mayo Clinic recommends that families seek emergency medical care at any sign of some of these symptoms.HUS is not the only concerning complication of an EHEC infection. EHEC can also potentially cause central nervous systems issues (including brain swelling and/or stroke), intestinal issues (like colitis), and hypertension (high blood pressure).Could My Children Become Infected?The scary answer is, yes. There has not yet been an identified source, and _E. coli_ can be in a variety of placed. _E. coli_, which is typically found in the intestinal tract of animals, has been traced to swimming pools, beaches, petting zoos, and various food products. Some of the food products involved in recent _E. coli_ outbreaks include: soy nut butter, beef, raw milk, and flour, to name a few.What Caused The _E. coli_ Outbreak?EHEC infections typically come from eating food that has been contaminated with the bacteria. Undercooked meat, especially hamburger, is one of the major sources of EHEC infections. Raw milk and raw milk produce, like soft cheeses, are also concerning vehicles of this illness. Thorough cooking of food and drinking pasteurized milk are recommended methods to reduce the likelihood of infection. Petting zoos, beaches, and swimming pools have also been the source of EHEC infections.The good news is that EHEC infections are preventable. Good hygiene practices, like hand washing, and cooking food to their optimum cooking temperatures are only a few ways you can help reduce the likelihood of infection. If you have a child and you reside in or around Cave City, Sharp County, Arkansas, and your child is exhibiting symptoms of EHEC infection, urgent medical care is highly recommended. You child's pediatrician or local emergency room can diagnose an infection through a routine stool test. It is important that you request a stool test, and inform your doctor of your concerns that your child may have an EHEC infection. Urgent medical care is crucial to reduce the risk of the development of HUS and other potentially severe long term complications.Unsafe Foods will continue to monitor this potential outbreak and make reports.[Byline: Candess Zona-Mendola]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED would like more information regarding this potential cluster of cases which may be due to EHEC.The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.A number of studies have studied Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).References:1.
