Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(13): pii=30496. doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.13.30496; <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22751>]----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------Since first identified in 2013, the H7N9 virus has caused several waves of human infections in China, with a current wave including a number of patients with very severe disease. Jiangsu is one of the most impacted provinces, whereby as of 31 Jan 2017, the number of human infections (n = 109) in the ongoing 5th H7N9 wave has exceeded the sum of those in the 4 preceding ones. 10 of 13 cities in Jiangsu have been affected, and clustered infections as well as one co-infection with seasonal influenza have been observed. With a median age of 58 years and 74.3 percent (81/109) of patients being male, the characteristics of cases are similar to those in previous waves, however patients with H7N9 seem to have an accelerated disease progression. Preliminary case fatality remains above 30 percent. No significant viral mutations have been found in key functional loci. Environmental H7N9 detection rate and number of days with high risk ambient temperatures were both significantly elevated during the month of December 2016 when most human infections were reported. A number of municipal governments in Jiangsu have implemented live poultry market closures to impede viral transmission to humans. A detectable decline in human infections has been observed in these municipalities and the entire province since January 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] ShandongDate: Sun 2 Apr 2017 19:11 PM CSTSource: FIC (Flu Information Centre/Flu in China) [edited]<http://www.flu.org.cn/en/news_detail?action=ql&uid=&pd=&newsId=19207>A 58-year-old male was confirmed to be a human case of H7N9 AIV [avian influenza virus infection] in Linyi city of Shandong province on [1 Apr 2017], according to the HFPC [Health and Family Planning Commission] of Shandong province.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] WHO updates - 3,5 Apr 2017Date: Mon 3 and Wed 5 Apr 2017Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/03-april-2017-ah7n9-china/en/> and<http://www.who.int/csr/don/05-april-2017-ah7n9-china/en/>Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - China----------------------------------------------------------[The information below is a compilation of the WHO updates of 3 and 5 Apr 2017. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]Between 24 and 31 Mar 2017] the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 35 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in mainland China.Details of the cases--------------------Onset dates ranged from 6 to 24 Mar 2017. Of these 35 cases, 10 were female. The age range among the cases is 37 to 86 years old. The cases were reported from Anhui (1), Fujian (3) Guangxi (8), Guizhou (3), Henan (1), Hubei (2), Hunan (10), Jiangsu (3), Jiangxi (1), and Zhejiang (3)At the time of notification, there were 5 deaths, and 30 cases were diagnosed as either pneumonia (6) or severe pneumonia (24). 32 cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market. One case is still under investigation. No clusters were reported.To date, a total of 1364 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.Public health response----------------------Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures including:- continuing to strengthen control measures with a focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.- assessing and analysing the avian influenza A(H7N9) epidemic trend to guide control measures in the provinces;- requiring all provinces to stay vigilant and to fully implement control and preventive measures;- increasing attention and guidance to certain central and western provinces that are reporting more cases to strengthen control and prevention.- conducting public risk communication and information publicity to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.- strengthening trace-back investigations and etiology surveillance to define the scope of virus pollution and mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.WHO risk assessment-------------------The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the 5th epidemic wave (that is, onset since 1 Oct 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.WHO advice----------WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Hunan: ban on poultry tradingDate: Mon 3 Apr 2017Source: The News International, Reuters report [edited]<https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/196119-China-reports-six-new-bird-flu-cases-one-death>China reported 6 new cases of H7N9 bird flu including one death in Hunan after live poultry markets in the province were shuttered last month [March 2017]. The infections were reported in the last week of March by the provincial center for disease control and prevention, according to a report by Xinhua news agency on [Sun 2 Apr 2017].A total ban on live poultry trading in the provincial capital of Changsha has been in effect since [17 Mar 2017] and will continue for another 5 days, the agency said. In March authorities reported an outbreak of the virus in the province originating from a farm with about 29,760 infected birds. Over 170,000 birds were culled as a result.The number of human infections this season has surged to the highest level since 2009. At least 162 deaths have been reported since October. Health authorities said that cold and wet weather in Hunan played a role in the recent spread of the virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Details of the 6 new cases reported from Hunan can be seen at <http://www.flu.org.cn/en/news_detail?action=ql&uid=&pd=&newsId=19210>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ][Continued surveillance, early detection, and management of detected cases using proper infection control practices are the key. - Mod.UBAMaps of China can be seen at <http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
