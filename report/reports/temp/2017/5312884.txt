CDC, _Campylobacter_ (Campylobacteriosis), Outbreaks [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/index.html>Multistate outbreak of human _Campylobacter_ infections linked to pet store puppies----------------------------------------------------------------------39 cases, 7 states, 9 hospitalizations, 0 deathsThe Ohio Department of Health, several other states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of human _Campylobacter_ infections linked to puppies sold through Petland, a national pet store chain.The outbreak includes 39 people with laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter_ infections or symptoms consistent with _Campylobacter_ infection who live in 7 states (Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin) and were exposed to puppies sold through Petland stores.- 12 are Petland employees from 4 states.- 27 either recently purchased a puppy at Petland, visited a Petland, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through Petland before illness began.Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that puppies sold through Petland stores are a likely source of this outbreak. Petland is cooperating with public health and animal health officials to address this outbreak._Campylobacter_ can spread through contact with dog poop (feces). It usually does not spread from one person to another.This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates as more information becomes available.Initial announcement - 11 Sep 2017----------------------------------The Ohio Department of Health, several other states, CDC, and USDA-APHIS are investigating a multistate outbreak of human _Campylobacter_ infections linked to puppies sold through Petland stores. Investigators are looking for the source of infections in people and puppies so they can recommend how to stop the outbreak and prevent more illnesses in order to protect human and animal health.As of 11 Sep 2017, the outbreak includes 39 cases in 7 states (Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). A list of the number of cases by state can be found on the Case Count Map page at <https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-9-17/map.html>.Illnesses began on dates ranging from 15 Sep 2016 through 12 Aug 2017. The most recent illness was reported on 1 Sep 2017.Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 64 years, with a median age of 22 years; 28 (72 percent) are female; and 9 (23 percent) report being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.Epidemiologic and laboratory findings have linked the outbreak to contact with puppies sold through Petland stores. Among the 39 ill people, 12 are Petland employees from 4 states, and 27 either recently purchased a puppy at Petland, visited a Petland, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through Petland before illness began.Whole genome sequencing showed samples of _Campylobacter_ isolated from the stool of puppies sold through Petland in Florida were closely related to _Campylobacter_ isolated from the stool of an ill person in Ohio. Additional laboratory results from people and dogs are pending.Regardless of where they are from, any puppies and dogs may carry _Campylobacter_ germs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Puppies should be active, alert, and have shiny coats. It is advisable to take your new puppy, regardless of where you obtain the animal, to a veterinarian within a few days and certainly within the week you acquire the puppy, or any new animals for a thorough check.If your puppy is ill, take it to your veterinarian. Those in contact with ill animals should be careful to wash hands thoroughly with soap, especially after cleaning up after animal._Campylobacter_ can also be a human health hazard. Immunologically compromised people, persons on chemotherapy, pregnant women, very young children, and perhaps the very elderly may be more susceptible. Symptoms in people may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sometimes bloody, and fever. If you believe you are experiencing symptoms of campylobacteriosis, please contact your physician. - Mod.TG][The following, regarding dogs as a source of campylobacteriosis, was extracted from Iannino F, Di Donato G, Ruggieri E, et al: _Campylobacter_ infections, a significant issue of veterinary urban hygiene: dog-related risk factors. Vet Ital 2017; 53: 111-120 with the reference citations removed:""Dogs have been identified as asymptomatic carriers of _Campylobacter_ species and their role as a source of infection for humans has been demonstrated. It has been reported that approximately 6 percent of human campylobacteriosis cases are due to contact with pets.The role of _Campylobacter_ as an enteric pathogen in dogs is unclear. Some studies found no significant relationship between diarrhea and _Campylobacter_ spp. infection, suggesting that the organism is a commensal. At the same time, other studies report an association between infection and clinical signs, particularly in younger dogs. Lesions described are characteristic but not pathognomonic. The colon may be congested and edematous, mild to severe hemorrhagic colitis and edematous mesenteric lymph nodes may be present. Cases of perinatal death associated with _C. jejuni_ infection of fetus-placental organs are reported.Dogs carry a wide range of _Campylobacter_ species. Some studies report _C. jejuni_ as the most common species, although others indicate _C. upsaliensis_ as predominant. Simultaneous presence of multiple species with various pathogenicity characteristics can also occur. Koene and colleagues describe multiple _Campylobacter_ species in 26 percent of the positive-testing stools.All consulted studies show that dogs should be regarded as potential sources of exposure for humans. The prevalence of dogs carrying _Campylobacter_ spp. varies widely, depending on the sampled population, on the design of the study, and on the detection method. The main factors affecting prevalence, and recorded in literature, are: environment, age, presence of diarrhea or enteric disease, high-density housing (such as kennels), contact with other animals, walking outdoors, and season."" - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
