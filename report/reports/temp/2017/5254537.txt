North Dakota Department of Health [edited]<https://health.nd.gov/media/1806/2017-08-15-h3n2v_final.pdf>The North Dakota Department of Health (NDDoH) reports a confirmed case of variant influenza A H3N2v in a child with exposure to pigs. Influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs are called variant influenza when the virus is found in people.Variant influenza viruses are different from typical circulating human influenza A viruses. Most cases of variant influenza occur during summer months in people who raise pigs, or who had contact with pigs at agricultural events like fairs. Influenza viruses do not typically move readily between people and pigs, so variant influenza cases are rare.Symptoms of variant influenza are similar to those of seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches and lack of appetite. People seeing a health care provider for a respiratory illness should let their provider know if they have had recent exposure to pigs. Providers should alert the NDDoH if they suspect variant influenza. ""This is the 1st time a North Dakota resident has tested positive for variant influenza,"" said Jill Baber, an epidemiologist with the NDDoH. ""The child visited the North Dakota State Fair in Minot and had direct contact with pigs. The child was hospitalized, but has since been released and is recovering."" A 2nd case associated with the State Fair, in a non-North Dakota resident has also been identified.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the available data from CDC , most infections with variant viruses have occurred in children (persons 18 or younger) and most cases have reported direct or indirect exposure to swine prior to onset of illness. Limited transmission from close contact with an infected person has been observed in some investigations of human infections with variant viruses, but sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.According to the last update on CDC webpage [<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/variant-cases-us.htm>], there have been 390 total confirmed cases of A/H3N2v to date.On [Fri 18 Aug 2017] a variant case in Pennsylvania was reported in FluView. As of this time, that case has been characterized as an influenza A (H3) variant (H3v) virus. Further analysis is being performed at CDC to characterize the neuraminidase protein of this virus. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/236>.]
