Focus Taiwan [edited]<http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201704120016.aspx>A flight attendant for EVA Airways was confirmed [Wed 5 Apr 2017] as being infected with measles, and is known to have had contact with 170 people during the incubation period, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).CDC deputy director-general Philip Lo said the patient, in her 20s, served in the elite class of EVA Flight B62 that departed from Vienna for Bangkok from last Wednesday to [Thu 6 Apr 2017], and then in the elite class of Flight BR212 that departed from Thailand for Taiwan last [Fri 7 Apr 2017]. During the incubation period, the patient had visited France, Singapore, Beijing and Hangzhou in China, and Bangkok, Lo said.CDC has identified the 170 contacts, including her family members, passengers and colleagues on the same flights, as well as health care personnel and patients that she came into contact with when she sought medical attention on [Mon 10 Apr 2017].Measures are being taken to monitor if the infection is spreading or not, Lo said, urging passengers on those flights to conduct self-health management for 18 days. The health monitoring is recommended until April 24 [2017] for those who took the flight last Wednesday and Thursday (5--6 Apr 2017), CDC said.EVA Air said other flight attendants on the same flights as the patient have also been asked to conduct self-health management. None of them has developed any symptoms so far, the company said.According to CDC data, the flight attendant developed a fever and oral herpes last [Sat 8 Apr 2017], and a rash over her body the next day. On [Mon 10 Apr 2017], she sought medical attention at a hospital, which then collected specimens from her for laboratory testing and requested that she conduct home quarantine. On [Wed 12 Apr 2017], the patient was confirmed to have been infected with measles, making her the 5th case this year [2017].All 5 cases were imported and determined to have been contracted in China, Indonesia, Europe and Thailand, respectively, CDC said, noting that the number of cases is the highest for April over the past 3 years.CDC has issued a measles travel notice categorized as ""watch"" for 11 countries -- China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Kazakhstan, Romania, Italy, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The agency advised people planning to travel to those countries to get inoculated beforehand.[byline: Chen Ting-wei and Elizabeth Hsu]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] USA (Minnesota)Date: Wed 12 Apr 2017 06:20PM CDTSource: Fox [edited]<http://www.fox9.com/news/248225233-story>Up to 2 cases of measles in Minnesota may not sound like much to worry about, but there's a big question mark in this investigation: What is the source? Without knowing that, it's hard to know how many more cases could develop. While 2 children are being treated, public health workers are on the phone notifying anyone who may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease.""Then it's a lot more boots on the ground kind of work to identify who might have been exposed, but that's the work of public health,"" said Kris Ehresmann of the Infectious Disease division of the Minnesota Department of Health. There is a connection between the 2 infected children, but neither child has traveled outside the country. This means that investigators don't know the source, so the search is on, with workers trying to prevent any kind of mass outbreak.""While many people develop measles and it's moderate to severe, there are individuals who are hospitalized who can develop severe pneumonia,"" said Ehresmann. ""We do see deaths from measles.""In Minnesota, 94 per cent of kindergartners have had the MMR vaccine, but it's those who have not had it that are at the greatest risk. The classic symptom is a rash, but the very 1st symptoms are actually cough, runny nose and watery eyes - symptoms easily mistaken for a cold or allergy. You are infectious for 4 days with these seemingly minor symptoms. Between that and not knowing the source of these latest 2 cases, there is cause for concern. ""So I think it's important for people to realize that we have 2 cases now, we do expect that we will likely see more cases of measles, and that will not be surprising to us,"" Ehresmann said.Measles was declared eliminated in the US back in 2000, which means the cases that we do have are brought in from other countries. Right now, Europe is having a major measles outbreak, so traveling there unvaccinated could be risky.[byline: Karen Scullin]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] USA (Minnesota, Hennepin County)Date: Thu 13 Apr 2017 10:49PMSource: Star Tribune [edited]<http://www.startribune.com/three-measles-cases-confirmed-in-hennepin-county/419425734/>Minnesota health officials are investigating 3 cases of measles in Hennepin County in an effort to identify the source of the infections and determine if others have been exposed. So far investigators have confirmed measles in 3 toddlers in Hennepin County, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Like most new cases in the US, the infected children were not vaccinated against the disease.Local and state public health departments ""are following up on other potential cases associated with the confirmed illnesses,"" the department said [Thu 13 Apr 2017] afternoon.Measles was declared to be officially eradicated in the US in 2000, but international travelers who have been exposed in foreign countries can spark new infections here when they come in contact with someone who doesn't have immunity. Minnesota sees a small number of cases each year -- in the past 4 years there were just 2 cases annually. But in 2011, a small outbreak resulted in 26 cases. All were imported or were linked to foreign travel.[byline: Glenn Howatt]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>
