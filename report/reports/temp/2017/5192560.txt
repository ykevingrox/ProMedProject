Geelong Advertiser [edited]<http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/city-hall/geelong-saleyards-dozens-of-workers-test-positive-for-q-fever/news-story/d5dd0f88a679e0a487c2eba1e908d313>Dozens of council workers at the historic Geelong Saleyards have tested positive to the disease Q fever, prompting the Australian Services Union to demand a ""please explain"".The City of Greater Geelong has revealed 25 Geelong Saleyards workers had shown positive results for the presence of Q fever antibodies, out of 42 tested for the condition.Despite the positive tests, the council was not aware of any workers receiving an official diagnosis to date. The zoonotic disease is transmitted from animals to humans and can cause fever, chills, headaches and muscle pain, and in rare cases long-term liver and heart problems.The Australian Services Union has hit out at the council, claiming about 50 workers had tested positive to Q fever and that workers were not being vaccinated for the disease. ""We had no idea it was this bad,"" Australian Services Union Victorian Branch secretary Richard Duffy said. ""Over 80 percent of people who have been tested have tested positive, and they've tested over 60 people now.""There are a variety of symptoms, some people are off work, but they're continuing to test people. The more we look into it the worse it gets."" Mr Duffy said the union was concerned by workers' claims they had not been immunised against Q fever, despite the use of vaccines being considered best practice for those working with animals. ""It turns out that nobody has been immunised against it or vaccinated against it,"" he said. ""We are seeking an urgent meeting with council to find out why.""The bacterium that causes the Q fever can remain in the environment for a long time, is airborne and can survive disinfectants and harsh conditions. Acting city services director Peter Godfrey said the council had been testing and vaccinating staff employed at the saleyards for ""a number of years"", and played down the positive tests. ""It is possible for a person to test positive to Q fever antibodies without ever having shown symptoms of the infection, and many years after exposure to the bacteria,"" Mr Godfrey said. ""All City employees have been informed of the risks associated with exposure to Q fever at staff meetings and through an organisation-wide safety alert.""A safety sign at the Geelong Saleyards, installed during works prior to reopening of the site in February 2017, states that Q fever vaccination is recommended for all persons attending the site."" However the Geelong Advertiser could not find the sign when it visited the saleyards yesterday [Tue 18 Jul 2017] and was later informed that the sign, which was inside the saleyards, was not ""Q fever specific"". There is no mention of Q fever or recommended vaccinations on the council's Saleyards web page, which includes advice, frequently asked questions and an Occupational Health and Safety report. A sheep and poultry sale at the Geelong Saleyards is still scheduled to go ahead on [Mon 24 Jul 2017].A report into the local livestock industry by analyst Mercado, commissioned by CoGG this year [2017], found issues raised by stakeholders including ""concern for cross-contamination of airborne diseases"". Geelong Saleyards Users Group head Ian Kelly said the results weren't surprising, and that the workers could have been exposed to the disease previously.The bacterium that causes the Q fever can remain in the environment for a long time, is airborne and can survive disinfectants and harsh conditions.Farmers, abattoir workers and shearers are at the highest risk of developing the disease.Q fever is caused by a microorganism that is mainly carried by goats, sheep and cattle. It can also be carried by kangaroos, wallabies, camels, rodents, cats, dogs and birds. The bacteria can survive many disinfectants and harsh conditions. It can remain in the environment for long periods of time, which means dust, hay and other small particles may carry the bacteria. It is airborne so can be contracted by breathing in dust from infected premises and properties. Contact with the urine or faeces of infected animals and/or contaminated wool or hides can also transmit the disease. The highest risk of transmission is through contact with the birth products of infected animals.Flu-like symptoms including fever, headaches, chills and muscle pains. Only 50 percent of people who contract Q fever develop symptoms. In rare cases, long-term heart and liver problems can result. Acute cases usually require antibiotics.

For a map showing the location of Geelong in relation to Melbourne, see <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Geelong+Saleyards,+North+Geelong+VIC+3215,+Australia>.The Geelong Saleyards, established in 1869 by the Geelong Town Corporation, is a venue for farmers from across the region to buy and sell sheep, cattle and poultry (<https://www.geelongaustralia.com.au/saleyards/default.aspx>). A truck wash also operates at the Saleyards, to clean out trucks between loads, reducing the possible spread of disease.The Saleyards was subject to a study in 2016 because of location, safety and financial concerns (<http://www.geelongaustralia.com.au/common/public/documents/8d3e8703357bd3e-Geelong%20Saleyards%20Feasibility%20Study%20-%20Final%20Report%20for%20Consultation%20(3).pdf>). Although once located in an outlying area without neighboring urban uses, the Saleyards are now completely surrounded by urban development and is within close proximity to the Geelong city center.Serum antibodies to _Coxiella burnetii_, the cause of Q fever, remain detectable for years, or even for life. In the U.S., 3.1 percent of the general adult U.S. population has been found to have detectable antibodies to _C. burnetii_ (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm>) and the seroprevalence in Queensland, Australia has been found to be about 5 percent in rural, as well as metropolitan (Brisbane) settings (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21499708>). Because of persistence of a positive serology, a confirmed diagnosis of acute Q fever requires a demonstration of a 4-fold rise in phase II IgG by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) between serum samples from the acute and convalescent phases taken 3-6 weeks apart (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm>). A single positive convalescent serum sample (IgG phase II greater than or equal to 1:128) in a patient who has been ill greater than 1 week indicates a probable acute infection. Serum PCR for Q fever is positive for _C. burnetii_ in almost all patients with early acute Q fever, i.e., during the 1st 2 weeks of symptoms, before the antibody response. Chronic Q Fever (i.e., endocarditis) is diagnosed by a phase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1:800).Because early doxycycline treatment (within the 1st 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a symptomatic patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm>). Treatment is not indicated for people with only positive serologic titers (although it might be considered in persons at high risk for development of chronic Q fever - see <https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm>).In Australia, the organism is found in livestock, including goats, cattle, sheep, other farm and domestic animals, companion animals (dogs and cats) and in some wild animals (including kangaroos and bandicoots). People most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries and shearers, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants or farms.In Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (<https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/288>.]
