Polio Global Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Poliovirus Weekly UpdateAs of: 14-Jun-2017, World Health OrganizationNew wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 6Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 6Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5Headlines- Global health leaders are meeting this week at the Rotary International Convention in Atlanta, USA, and reaffirmed their commitment to eradicating polio by pledging US$1.2 billion to end the disease.- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan - one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was isolated from a healthy household contact of an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case. See country-specific sections below for more details.Afghanistan- One new wild poliovirus type 1(WPV1) case was reported in the past week with onset of paralysis, [16 Apr 2017] from Nawzad district, Hilmand. The virus was isolated from a healthy household contact of this case. This brings the total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 to 4 and is the most recent case in the country.- With most of Afghanistan polio-free, efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen operations, in close coordination with Pakistan, to address remaining low-level transmission in the common reservoir area of the Quetta-Kandahar corridor.- Afghanistan is carrying out a programme review focusing on the implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan and making necessary adjustments for the second half of 2017.- Polio eradication teams from East and South East Afghanistan and neighbouring FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan met in Kabul on [24 - 25 May 2017] to review the current coordination mechanisms and agree on additional measures to further improve implementation in the WPV common reservoirs. Core teams from the National Emergency Operation Centres Afghanistan and Pakistan also met to discuss next steps on further improving the vaccination strategies for high risk mobile populations.Pakistan- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 2, and for 2016 remains 20. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [13 Feb 2017], from Diamir district, Gilgit Baltistan.- The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan.- The National Polio Management Team is meeting on [8 - 9 Jun 2017] to review implementation of the National Emergency Action Plan during the low transmission season, and to agree on essential adjustments to the plan for the second half of 2017.Nigeria- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country.- The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighbouring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger.- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.Lake Chad Basin- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region. Central Africa- No new cases were reported in the past week. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is affected by 2 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), in Haut Lomami province (2 cases, with onset of paralysis on [8 Mar 2017 and 20 Feb 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [2 May 2017]).- Outbreak response plans are currently being finalised, with supplementary immunization activities using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.- DR Congo is also affected by an Ebola outbreak, in Bas Uele province in the north of the country. Coordination among both outbreak response teams will be necessary and teams are already working on this.Syrian Arab Republic- In Syria, no new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. Total number of cVDPV2 cases remains 2 for 2017, both from Mayadeen district of Dier-Ez-Zor governorate, with onset of paralysis of [5 Mar 2017 and 6 May 2017]. The virus strain was also confirmed from a healthy contacts, collected on [25 Apr 2017].- No case of WPV1 has been reported in Syria since [21 Jan 2014].- Outbreak response plans are being finalized, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Although access to Deir-Ez-Zor is compromised due to insecurity, the Governorate has been partially reached by several vaccination campaigns against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases since the beginning of 2016. Most recently, 2 campaigns have been conducted in March and April 2017 using the bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV). However, only limited coverage was possible through these campaigns.Officially reported wild poliovirus cases as of 13 Jun 2017Total global cases in 2017: 6 (compared with 17 for the same period in 2016)Total in endemic countries in 2017: 6 (compared with 17 for the same period in 2016)Total in non-endemic countries in 2017: 0 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016)- Afghanistan: 4 cases in 2017 (compared with 6 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 16 Apr2017- Pakistan: 2 cases in 2017 (compared with 11 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 13 Feb 2017- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 21 Aug 2016- Total global cases in 2016: 37- Total in endemic countries: 37- Total in non-endemic countries: 0Officially reported cVDPV cases as of 13 Jun 2017Total global cases in 2017: 6 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016)- Syrian Arab Republic: 2 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 6 May 2017- Democratic Republic of the Congo: 4 cases in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 18 Apr 2017- Pakistan: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 17 Dec 2016- Nigeria: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 0 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 28 Oct 2016- Lao People's Democratic Republic: 0 case in 2017 (compared with 3 for the same period in 2016), onset of paralysis of most recent case: 11 Jan 2016- Total global cases in 2016: 5- Total in endemic countries: 2- Total in non-endemic countries: 3--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The good news is that we are almost halfway through this calendar year (2017) and there have only been 6 confirmed cases of polio due to infection with the WPV1 - with all 6 cases reported from 2 endemic countries - Afghanistan (4 cases) and Pakistan (2 cases). The bad news is that there continue to be environmental samples in Pakistan with WPV1 isolates - most likely due to asymptomatic infections, but a sign that the virus continues to circulate in the country.The good news from Nigeria, (the 3rd remaining endemic country) is that there have been no further WPV1 associated polio cases identified since late August 2016. A cVDPV2 was identified in Nigeria in October 2016. I have been unable to find information on possible environmental sampling ongoing in Nigeria to see if there is evidence of continued circulation of both the WPV1 and the cVDPV2.A map showing the locations of confirmed WPV and cVDPV cases can be found at: <http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Afghanistan can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/137>. - Mod.MPP]
