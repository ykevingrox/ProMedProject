The New Times [edited]<http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2017-04-14/210661/>An outbreak of cholera/acute watery diarrhea (AWD) in Somalia's semi-autonomous regions of Somaliland and Puntland has killed over 85 people, a global charity said [on Wed 12 Apr 2017].The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said 28 people were killed in the last 10 days and 167 others hospitalized in Somaliland alone. In neighboring Puntland, more than 1600 cases of cholera/AWD with 57 deaths have been recorded since January [2017], the charity said in a statement. Julie Hall, IFRC director of health, said during the 2011 famine in Somalia, tens of thousands of people suffering from hunger died from preventable and treatable diseases like diarrhea. ""What often stands between hunger and death is disease. We must move quickly to stop the spread of disease and provide those affected with treatment. Diseases haunt those who are hungry; we can fight this,"" said Hall.The charity said the outbreak has overwhelmed remote communities in the drought-ravaged region. More than 411 cases of cholera/AWD have been reported in Somaliland since the beginning of April [2017]. The vulnerable children and adults, already struggling to cope with malnutrition and food insecurity caused in large part by the failure of 2016's 2 rainy seasons, were struck down by the deadly disease after drinking contaminated water.--communicated by:ProMED-EAFR from HealthMap Alerts<promed-@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - SomaliaDate: Wed 12 Apr 2017Source: Terra [machine trans. edited]<https://saude.terra.com.br/cruz-vermelha-alerta-sobre-suto-de-colera-em-duas-regioes-da-somalia,5dbb565f44be72ca099dfe4bb996998ewoep5h8l.html>An outbreak of cholera and acute diarrhea in autonomous regions Somaliland and Puntland caused a number of deaths and hospitalizations, warned the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) on 12 Apr 2017.Since the beginning of April [2017], more than 411 cases of cholera and acute diarrhea in Somaliland, northern Somalia, ""devastated remote communities in the drought-stricken region,"" The IFRC said in a statement. In the last 10 days, 28 people died in Somaland, and 167 had to be hospitalized. In the Taleex region, 160 km from Las Anod, Somalia, 12 people died, while in Buhodle, near the border with Ethiopia, there were 14 deaths.In Puntland, north eastern Somalia, more than 1600 cases of acute cholera and diarrhea and 57 deaths have occurred since January 2017. In Somalia, there are 2 900 000 people in need of assistance, and the UN estimates that 1 000 000 children under the age of 5 will suffer from severe malnutrition this year [2017].--communicated by:ProMED-Port <promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Cholera - SomaliaDate: Thu 13 Apr 2017Source: Reuters [edited]<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-drought-cholera-idUSKBN17F11Z>More than 25 000 people in famine-threatened Somalia have been struck by cholera or acute watery diarrhea, and the deadly epidemic should double by this summer, WHO said on Thu 13 Apr 2017. The United Nations is already racing to avoid a repeat of famine in the drought-hit Horn of Africa nation where more than 250 000 people died of starvation in 2011.Cholera, which is endemic in Somalia, is an acute diarrhoeal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated. Malnourished children under 5 years are especially vulnerable. Already, 25 424 infected people have been identified since the start of the year, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said by email, adding: ""These numbers are projected to increase to 50 000 by summer."" The case fatality rate for the disease, spread by contaminated food or water, is already 2.1 per cent in Somalia, twice the emergency threshold, he said. At least 524 deaths have been recorded.Cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration solution. Severe cases will need rapid treatment with intravenous fluids and antimicrobials, according to WHO.Death rates among Somalis infected with cholera now reach 14.1 per cent in Middle Juba and 5.1 percent in Bakool, UN spokesman Jens Laerke told a news briefing. ""We still have 2.9 million people in level 3 and 4, level 4 being the step just before we declare a famine,"" Laerke said, referring to the UN classification, ""so almost 3 million in those critical and crisis emergency levels.""The centre of the cholera outbreak is Baidoa, David Akopyan, UN Development Programme (UNDP) deputy country director for Somalia, told the briefing by telephone from the capital Mogadishu. 13 of Somalia's 18 regions are affected, he said. Some 500 000 Somalis have been internally displaced, many in search of water, as well as some 3 million pastoralists who have lost 70 percent of their livestock due to drought, he said.[byline: Stephanie Nebehay]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] Cholera - SudanDate: Sun 9 Apr 2017Source: Relief Web [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/cholera-continues-claim-victims-sudan-s-el-gedaref>Another cholera patient died in eastern Sudan's El Gedaref state last week. ""One person died of cholera, and 4 new cases were reported in the area of Shueib in Gireisha locality on Thursday and Friday [6-7 Apr 2017],"" a medical source told Radio Dabanga. He strongly criticised the state's Health Ministry for ""its lack of interest in combating cholera and curbing its spread."" He also noted that the federal Ministry of Health continues to define the disease as watery diarrhea.Reports about the spread of ""watery diarrhea"" in various parts of Sudan increased during the last quarter of 2016. At least 17 people died of the disease in Blue Nile state in September 2016. The Health Ministry reported cases in Blue Nile and Kassala in southern and eastern Sudan and River Nile state in northern Sudan in the same month. The 1st samples of patients were examined for cholera as well. Since then, the deadly disease spread to other localities in eastern, central, and northern Sudan.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[5] Cholera - South SudanDate: Fri 7 Apr 2017Source: Relief Web [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/acaps-briefing-note-south-sudan-cholera-outbreak-mingkaman-awerial-county-lake>671 cholera cases have been reported in Awerial county, Lakes, since June 2016, of which at least 117 are new cases since 6 Mar 2017. Most new cases have been reported in Mingkaman IDP camp. The case fatality rate (CFR) is 1.49 per cent or 10 deaths.A lack of facilities has been reported, further spreading the outbreak. The upcoming rainy season, from May/June [2017] onwards, will also likely further deteriorate the situation and result in an increased number of cholera cases.Neighbouring Yirol East county has also experienced an increase of cholera cases, as reported below. Movement of population between the 2 counties may trigger a wider spread of the outbreak.Given the high density of population in the camp, the lack of facilities, and the recent increase of cholera cases, a wider spread of the cholera outbreak is expected. Floods, a consequence of the upcoming rainy season (May-June to October 2017), will further deteriorate the situation within the camp, with expected new cholera cases.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>*****[6] Diarrhea - EthiopiaDate: Fri 7 Apr 2017Source: Tolerance [edited]<http://www.tolerance.ca/ArticleExt.aspx?ID=348105&L=en>Ethiopia has declared an outbreak of acute watery diarrhea, also known as AWD, in the country's Somali region, where people are already struggling to cope with a persistent drought.Dr Akpaka Kalu, the WHO representative to Ethiopia, told VOA on Fri 7 Apr 2017 that 16 000 cases of AWD had been recorded in the region since January 2017. The total number of deaths is uncertain.Regional president Abdi Mohammed Omar said on Fri 7 Apr 2017 that 19 children had died of AWD in Dollo zone, an area near the southern border with Somalia. This week, residents of a remote village, Qorile, told VOA's Somali service that dozens had died, and more than 700 had received treatment for the illness. Omar said some of the treatment centers set up to address the outbreak were making headway. ""We have managed to control the worst effects of the disease by establishing temporary emergency medical posts in remote villages,"" he said.Federal authorities have deployed 500 nurses and 68 doctors to fight the disease, in addition to 700 trained health officers, he told VOA's Amharic service. In addition, WHO has deployed teams on the ground and set up treatment camps to address the outbreak.Kalu said a UN team regional coordinator, WHO representatives, and a few others would go to the Somali region, also known as the Ogaden, on Sat 8 Apr 2017 to assess the situation. ""From WHO, for example, we have near 40 people on the ground right now. A team went there today [date?] in addition to the team that's been on the ground for some months now,"" he said over the telephone. ""So we are there working, supporting them to bring it under control.""On Mon 3 Apr 2017, a woman who told VOA Somali that she had lost 5 relatives to cholera and that hundreds of people were suffering from the disease, reportedly treated by Ethiopian authorities.It is not reported what is causing the outbreak in Ethiopia. But Kalu said the government was assessing the situation to try to determine the cause. Asked whether it was a cholera outbreak, Kalu said: ""Cholera is a laboratory diagnosis. You have to test the stool to confirm the cause of the acute watery diarrhea [AWD is generally a euphemism for cholera. - Mod.LL]. The government of Ethiopia has declared it acute watery diarrhea. The [assessment] is going on to confirm the causes of acute watery diarrhea, and government is doing that.""[byline: Henok Fente, Salem Solomon & Eskender Frew]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This Voice of America report (<http://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/study-finds-link-between-el-nino-and-cholera-outbreaks/3807601.html>)reports a link between El NiÌ±o and cholera outbreaks in east Africa:Researchers are now reporting a link between the weather event known as El NiÌ±o and an increase in cholera cases in eastern Africa. This means that knowing when there is going to be an El NiÌ±o climate event might improve public health preparedness.El NiÌ±os are a global climate phenomenon that take place every 2 to 7 years. During an El NiÌ±o, the temperature of the ocean's surface, in the eastern Pacific near South America, becomes warmer than usual. The warming begins in late December. The following year, in the fall, sea surface temperatures also warm in the western Pacific, leading to extreme weather events like flooding and droughts. These conditions also support cholera outbreaks.Cholera is an infectious bacterial disease that people usually get from infected water supplies. The water becomes contaminated if human waste containing the bacteria enters the water. About 177 million people live in areas where the cases of cholera increase during El NiÌ±o. However, there has been little evidence of El NiÌ±o's health effect in Africa. The recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in March [2017] found that cholera cases increased in countries in East Africa.""They can lead to surface flooding that washes contamination into drinking water in areas where there's open defecation,"" said epidemiologist Sean Moore who led the study. ""It also can lead to overflowing of sewer systems in urban areas, which again can lead to contamination of drinking water."" Moore is an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore. He says there are about 150 000 cases of cholera a year, mostly in Africa south of the Saharan Desert.Researchers measured changes in the number of cholera cases during El NiÌ±os between the years 2000 and 2014. They found cases increased by almost 50 000 in eastern Africa during El NiÌ±o years. Scientists also saw a small increase in the number of cholera cases in areas hit by drought because of El NiÌ±o. Moore said when water supplies decrease, available drinking water can become contaminated by bacteria in human waste.The study also reported a surprising finding: cholera cases dropped in some parts of Africa. Researchers found there were 30 000 fewer cases reported in southern Africa during El NiÌ±o years compared to non-El NiÌ±o years. The reasons for the drop in cases is not clear at this time, Moore said.El NiÌ±o's can be predicted 6 to 12 months ahead of time, Moore said. That means public health officials can prepare for outbreaks, which usually happen soon after the climate event begins. ""An advanced warning could, even if it doesn't prevent outbreaks, at least prevent the deaths that tend to occur during the early part of an outbreak,"" he said.Using a treatment known as oral rehydration therapy, Moore said the risk of death from cholera drops to one percent. He said there are now low-cost cholera vaccines that could be used to prevent the disease if it is known that an area is going to be hit by an El NiÌ±o. - Mod.LL]
