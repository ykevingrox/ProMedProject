Evening Standard [edited]<https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/japanese-fungus-outbreak-hits-london-hospitals-a3611886.html>The outbreak of a potentially deadly fungus at a major London hospital was blamed on ""low nursing levels,"" the Standard reports.A total of 31 patients were colonised with the so-called ""Japanese fungus"" _Candida auris_ at King's College hospital, in Denmark Hill, after it was passed on from a woman patient admitted from the Royal Brompton, the specialist heart and lung hospital in Chelsea in April 2016.Today [15 Aug 2017] it emerged that more than 200 patients in 20 NHS trusts and private hospitals had been affected, with the intensive care units at the 2 London hospitals among the worst affected.The outbreak at King's lasted a year and only ended in April [2017]. In 6 cases, the fungus entered the bloodstream, causing an infection.Board papers for the hospital's parent NHS trust in March [2017] stated: ""While the trust is implementing infection prevention and control protocols, it was noted that the spread of the pathogen is affected by low nursing levels.""_Candida auris_ was 1st detected in the ear of a patient in Japan in 2009 and has been reported sporadically in England since 2013. The rare fungus, or yeast, lives on the skin or inside the body. Some patients carry it without becoming unwell, but it can cause infections if it gets into surgical wounds or when urinary catheters or drips are inserted.Last year [2016], the US warned that the fungus, which has a high mortality rate and is resistant to infection control measures, was spreading in US health facilities.Public Health England, which this week updated its guidance on dealing with an outbreak, said it appeared to be ""highly transmissible"" between patients, but none of this country's cases had proven fatal (<https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/candida-auris>).Patients who develop an infection are normally isolated, but King's said it had problems identifying it quickly and finding single rooms. Laboratory tests took ""8-9 days.""Across the NHS, 35 patients known to be carrying the fungus have been transferred between hospitals. A pilot scheme testing all patients admitted to intensive care was launched in 5 hospitals last month [July 2017].About a quarter of detections have been clinical infections, including 27 patients who developed bloodstream infections, Public Health England said. It recommends washing patients with chlorohexidine, a disinfectant used before surgery, to treat colonisation.Kings said its critical care units, liver, and cardiac wards were the worst hit. Board papers revealed: ""The 1st case was a patient admitted from the Royal Brompton in April 2016 who was known to be positive on admission and isolated in a side room on the critical care unit and cardiac wards during her hospital stay."" The Brompton, which is believed to have been the worst affected hospital in the country, was unable to say how many patients were affected.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur George A. Robertson[The following was extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Candida auris - USA (04): nosocomial, epidemiology, drug resistance Archive Number: 20170520.5050111:""Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, nosocomial, multidrug resistant pathogen associated with a high mortality. Epidemiologic investigations in the U.S. reported above revealed most cases in each state had exposure to common healthcare facilities or had recently received healthcare in other countries and testing in these facilities identified widespread environmental _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms. ""Genotyping of isolates by whole genome sequencing indicated that isolates were highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia, but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the United States followed by local transmission within healthcare settings. ""Antifungal susceptibility testing at CDC isolates were commonly resistant to fluconazole and many were also resistant to amphotericin B, but isolates were uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin) (3%).""The U.S. CDC recommends that all _Candida_ isolates obtained from a normally sterile site (e.g., bloodstream) and from non-sterile sites, for example, when a patient is failing therapy for suspected _Candida_ infection at that site or during suspected _Candida_ outbreaks or epidemiological investigations, be identified to the species level. The Public Health England (PHE) has similar recommendations (<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/637685/Updated_Candida_auris_Guidance_v2.pdf>).However, commercially available biochemical-based tests used in many U.S. laboratories to identify fungi cannot differentiate _C. auris_ from related species, and _C. auris_ may be misidentified as _Candida haemulonii_ or reported as _Candida_ species. Some matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) devices and molecular methods based on sequencing the D1-D2 region of the 28s rDNA or the Internal Transcribed Region (ITS) of rDNA, which may only be available at reference laboratories, can identify _C. auris_.The CDC and PHE encourages forwarding suspected _C. auris_ specimens to reference laboratories (CDC or state or regional public health laboratories in the U.S. or PHE Mycology Reference Laboratory in the UK) for further characterization. All confirmed isolates of _C. auris_ in the U.S. should be reported to local and state public health officials and to CDC at <candidaauris@cdc.gov> (<https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/candidiasis/recommendations.html>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40>.]
