Microservices [In Spanish, trans. Mod.JG, edited]<http://www.microservices.es/un-veinte-por-cien-de-los-casos-de-legionellosis-en-europa-estan-asociados-con-viajes>A study has been published in Eurosurveillance, which compiled all the data on legionnaires' disease in Europe for the period 2011 to 2015 [1]. This publication is from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The epidemiological surveillance of legionellosis in Europe is managed by the European Legionnaires' disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNET).Between 2011 and 2015, 29 European countries reported 30 532 cases of legionnaires' disease (28 188 confirmed cases, and 2344 probable cases).A total of 4 countries (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain) accounted for 70.3 percent of the total number of cases, but these countries represent half (50 percent) of the European population.The [incidence] rate for legionellosis increased from 0.97 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2011 to 1.30 in 2015.Up to 80 percent of cases occurred in persons more than 50-years-old, and the [case fatality] rate was 9.3 percent; the data has been stable for the last 5 years.Only 0.5% percent of the cases (159) had occurred in persons less than 20-years-old.In nearly 20 percent of the cases (19.9 percent, 5357), the infection was associated with travel and with staying outside home during the usual incubation period.The cases associated with healthcare facilities were 1973, representing 7.3 percent of the total number.Nearly 10 percent of the cases (9.9 percent) were associated with an outbreak or to a cluster, and the remaining 90.1 percent were isolated cases.The causative microorganism was _Legionella pneumophila_ in 96.2 percent of the cases, and the serogroup 1 was the most frequently identified, accounting for 82.9 percent of all.[1.

Between 2011 and 2015, 29 countries reported 30 532 LD cases to ECDC (28 188 (92.3 percent) confirmed and 2344 (7.7 percent) probable). Four countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) accounted for 70.3 percent of all reported cases, although their combined populations represented only 49.9 percent of the study population. The age-standardized rate of all cases increased from 0.97 cases/100 000 population in 2011 to 1.30 cases/100 000 population in 2015, corresponding to an annual average increase of 0.09 cases/100 000 population (95 percent CI 0.02-0.14; 0.02). Demographics and infection setting remained unchanged with ca 70 percent of cases being community-acquired and 80 percent occurring in people aged 50 years and older. Clinical outcome was known for 23 164 cases, of whom 2161 (9.3 percent) died. The overall case fatality ratio decreased steadily from 10.5 percent in 2011 to 8.1 percent in 2015, probably reflecting improved reporting completeness. Five countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, and Norway) had increasing age-standardised LD notification rates over the 2011-15 period, but there was no increase in notification rates in countries where the 2011 rate was below 0.5/100 000 population."" - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010>.]
