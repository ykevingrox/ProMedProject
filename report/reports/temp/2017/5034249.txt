[The campaign has been focused on vaccination of the populations where the cases have occurred. - Mod.TY]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Although the number of yellow fever cases continues to increase a bit, the outbreak appears to be declining. Fortunately, there are still no instances documented of _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission, although that risk will continue as long as the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is occurring.Individuals planning on traveling to the affected areas in Brazil, or other countries where YF is endemic, should seek vaccination as soon as possible because there is a predicted vaccine shortage starting in mid - to late summer, this year (2017) in the USA.A 12 May 2017 report indicated that between 27 Apr - 4 May 2017, Brazil has reported 14 additional confirmed cases in the states of Esp√å rito Santo (9) and Minas Gerais (5), and has discarded 164 suspected cases.Maps of Brazil can be accessed at <http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6>.
