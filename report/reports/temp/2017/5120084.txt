Focus Taiwan New Chanel, Central News Agency (CNA) report [edited]<http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201706190018.aspx>A woman from the southern Taiwan county of Pingtung, has been confirmed as having contracted Japanese encephalitis, making her the 4th person to be infected with the mosquito-borne disease in Taiwan this year [2017], the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on [Mon 19 Jun 2017].The 53-year-old patient sought medical treatment at a local hospital on [26 May 2017], after developing a fever, fainting, and symptoms of consciousness disturbance, said CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang.Because the symptoms persisted, the woman was transferred to another hospital for further treatment, Chuang added, noting that the case was then reported to the local health authority as suspected Japanese encephalitis and specimens submitted for laboratory testing.The diagnosis was confirmed on [Sun 18 Jun 2017].Chuang said that after conducting an epidemiological investigation, the CDC found the patient had not recently traveled overseas, nor been vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis. Instead, she spent most of her time at home.However, it was also noted that there is a pigeon and poultry farm approximately 2 km from the patient's residence, he said, adding that currently none of the family members with whom she cohabits have experienced any symptoms.Measures have been taken to prevent the further spread of the disease, including installing mosquito lamps around the residence of the patient and the places she frequents in an attempt to eliminate vector mosquitoes, according to the CDC.So far this year [2017], 4 cases of Japanese encephalitis have been confirmed in the country, including 2 in Kaohsiung and 1 in Tainan, CDC data show.Last year [2016], a total of 23 confirmed cases were recorded around Taiwan, fewer than the 30 cases in 2015, but more than 18 in 2014 and 16 in 2013, the data indicate.In addition, CDC data suggest that transmission of Japanese encephalitis in Taiwan mainly occurs annually between May and October and usually peaks between June and July. The agency notes that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease.As the primary vector, the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito, is known to breed in paddy fields, ponds, and irrigation canals. People are advised to avoid visiting those places at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.People suffering from Japanese encephalitis can experience serious psychological or neurological symptoms with a mortality rate as high as 20-30 percent, according to the CDC.[Byline: Chang Ming-hsuan, Elizabeth Hsu]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[As noted in the comment in the previous post, the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus transmission season in Taiwan has begun. JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individual above had not been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.Maps of Taiwan can be seen at <http://www.tmf.org.tw/index.php/maps-taiwan> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3962>. - Mod.TY]
