The victims, among them school children, were rushed to Muriranja District Hospital on [Wed 19 Jul 2017] after they developed symptoms associated with anthrax and food poisoning. 2 victims were admitted and referred to Kiria-ini Mission Hospital for further treatment. The victims included pupils from Gathaithi Upper and Maria-ini primary schools in Murarandia ward.The man who allegedly sold the uninspected meat disappeared after learning that his neighbours had fallen sick. The hospital medical superintendent, Dr Kairo Kimende, said 2 victims were admitted for further treatment and observation after they complained of severe abdominal pains.[Byline: Boniface Gitandi]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Kenya can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/kck73tk> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/61958>. Murang'a is just north east of Nairobi between Nyeri and Kiambu counties in central Kenya (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muranga_County>).This is the 2nd human outbreak in this area north of Nairobi. Clearly this region is in need of a proactive livestock anthrax control and surveillance programme. Vaccinating cattle against anthrax is far cheaper and more cost effective than the hospitalization costs of resulting human cases in the absence of animal vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]
