The health status of the patient is serious but stable and requires an oxygen mask,"" indicated the authority.This coming [Mon 20 Feb 2017] an environmental investigation will be initiated in order to determine the focus of infection and the people had contact with the patient, who will be transported in coming hours to the Las Condes Clinic in Santiago.The Health Authority acknowledged that these figures are worrisome, now that of the 6 infected individuals, 2 have died; the number that have occurred so far this season is the same as the total in all of 2016.In addition, preventive measures were reiterated and [the need] to be able to recognize the symptoms in order to go quickly to a [health] assistance unit and to initiate the corresponding treatment.[Published by Leonardo Casas; information from Danilo OrmeÌ±o]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the Los Lagos region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/28098>. - Mod.TY]******[2] Argentina (Buenos Aires province)Date: Thu 16 Feb 2017 10:00 ARTSource: MDZ [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.mdzol.com/nota/719424-la-mujer-fallecida-por-hantavirus-no-se-contagio-en-mendoza/>The Argentina Ministry of Health analyzed the possibility that the woman from Mendoza [province] who died due to [a] hantavirus [infection] in Buenos Aires contracted the infection in the province. They came to the definite conclusion and discarded [the possibility] that the woman contracted the disease in Mendoza [province]. She died at the beginning of February [2017] a result of the disease, which is transmitted by mice.The investigators reached this conclusion after analyzing the type of virus that the woman contracted and the incubation period of the disease. In this sense, they explained that the woman was in Buenos Aires for 2 months and the incubation period of the disease is between 15 and 35 days.""According to the data from our laboratory, which coincides with the published literature, the incubation period of HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] is estimated between 15-35 days,"" as explained in the report to which MDZ had access.""According to the epidemiological data provided, the patient was a resident of Mendoza province but for 2 months before onset of her symptoms was living in Sauce Grande, Monte Hermoso, in the province of Buenos Aires. In view of the data reported, Mendoza province must be discarded as the locality of infection,"" concluded the Molecular Biology Service of the Carlos Malbran Institute, where the studies were carried out. Given this, they established the site of infection must have been, ""the area of her residence in Monte Hermoso or surroundings, being sites of greater risk of infection.""The 36-year-old woman had moved from Mendoza to Monte Hermoso together with her family. She died 2 months later of [a] hantavirus [infection], a disease that has mice as vectors, in this Buenos Aires locality. From that time, an investigation began to determine whether she acquired the infection in Buenos Aires or in Mendoza.The report of the Ministry of Health also explained that the pathogenic genotype of the virus matched with and corresponds to the ""Buenos Aires"" type.[A copy of the Ministry of Health ""Report on the characterization of the genotype of Hantavirus"" (in Spanish), indicating that the S segment of the virus was analyzed, appears at the end of this report. Of the 3 subtypes of Andes lineage virus, Lechiguanas and Plata were discarded and Buenos Aires was matched.]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the case. For a change, this report indicates which virus was involved. The rodent host of this virus has not been determined.Maps of Argentina can be seen at <http://www.zonu.com/argentina_maps/Argentina_Regions_Map_2.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58007>. - Mod.TY]******[3] USA (Pennsylvania state): Seoul virus, pet ratDate: Thu 16 Feb 2017Source: The Sentinel [edited]<http://cumberlink.com/news/local/pet-rat-in-pa-confirmed-to-have-seoul-virus/article_28de82ab-82c4-58c9-80de-fae982b33399.html>The [Pennsylvania] state Department of Health [Thu 16 Feb 2017] confirmed that one pet rat in a Pennsylvania home-based breeding facility tested positive for the Seoul virus, which has infected humans in other areas of the country and across the world.The department said the infected Pennsylvania rat was purchased from a Tennessee breeding facility, which was confirmed to have rats infected with the virus. The remaining rats in the Pennsylvania facility were euthanized to prevent further spread of the disease.A type of hantavirus, Seoul virus is carried and spread by rodents, specifically the brown and Norway rat, the department said. People can become infected with the virus after coming into contact with the urine, droppings or saliva of infected rodents.No human infections of the Seoul virus have been confirmed in Pennsylvania at this time, the department said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate there are 13 human infections in the country from the worldwide outbreak. ""We are working very closely with the CDC to monitor any Seoul virus activity and prevent further exposure,"" Health Secretary Karen Murphy said. ""If you have pet rats you feel could be infected, or if you or your loved ones have been in contact with pet rats and have any symptoms of Seoul virus, you should contact the department at 1-877-PA-HEALTH.While this virus is spread only through infected rats, the health and safety of all Pennsylvanians is our priority.""Humans infected with the virus often have relatively mild symptoms or none at all. Symptoms include fever, headache, back and abdominal pain, chills, nausea, blurred vision, flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, and rash. In rare cases, infections can also lead to a type of acute renal disease called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The symptoms include low blood pressure, acute shock and acute kidney failure.There is no effective treatment for Seoul virus infections.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is another example of how Seoul virus can be transported via shipment of pet or laboratory rats, in this instance from a commercial breeding facility in Tennessee to a home breeding unit in Pennsylvania.Dr Jan Clement provided a good overview of Seoul virus around the world (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141028.2907225). Most reports are of Seoul virus in wild rats. However, the virus has also been isolated from laboratory and pet rats.An image of the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) can be accessed at <http://www.batconsultancy.co.uk/comrat.htm> and of a black rat (_Rattus rattus_) at <https://aepma.com.au/PestDetail/96/Black%20Rat>.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the USA showing the location of Pennsylvania and Tennessee can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/240>. - Mod.TY]
