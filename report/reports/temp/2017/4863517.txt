Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), necrotizing fasciitis, and puerperal fever or sepsis caused by GAS are notifiable in Belgium, but the local laboratories are not obliged to submit the isolates to the NRC.Since December 2016, 72 _S. pyogenes_ strains were obtained from 4 cases of STSS, 6 cases of fasciitis, 3 cases of meningitis, and 59 cases of sepsis received at the NRC. Eleven patients with invasive streptococcal infection died in the period of 3 months (December 2016 to February 2017), including 3 children younger than 3 years, compared with 17 (in the whole year 2013), 14 (2014), 19 (2015) and 29 (2016).In the NRC, we performed _emm_ typing and our preliminary results show that the increase is not due to the spread of a new _emm_ type or subtype. The _emm_ types circulating in that period (December 2016 to 13 Feb 2017) were _emm_1 (22.5 percent), _emm_3 (17.5 percent), _emm_89 (11.3 percent), and _emm_4 (10 percent). Compared to the previous years, there is no big shift. We received the strains from all regions in Belgium, and as far as we know, there is no known epidemiological link.--Communicated by:Erlangga Yusuf,Katherine Loens,Hilde Jansens,Herman GoossensAntwerp University HospitalNational Reference Center of BelgiumBelgium<Erlangga.Yusuf@uza.be>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Yusuf and colleagues for their report of the receipt by the National Reference Center (NRC) of Belgium of larger number of group A streptococcal (GAS) isolates that have caused invasive GAS infections in the period December 2016 to 13 Feb 2017 than in previous years. Local laboratories are not required to submit isolates to the NRC, so that the recent increase in the number of isolates submitted may be the result of a change in reporting behavior. However, the relative frequencies of _emm_ types are said to have remained stable.According to the CDC, approximately 10 000 - 15 000 cases of invasive GAS disease occur annually in the United States, associated with a 10-13 percent mortality rate (<https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html>).The capsular M surface protein of GAS is a major determinant of virulence. Sequencing the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes the M protein has replaced serologic methods for typing GAS. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/99>.][See Also:2016 ----Streptococcus, group A, invasive - USA: (NH) IDU, heroin, RFI 20161103.46050102008 ----Streptococcus, group A, emm-59, fatal - Canada: (ON) 20081011.32192005 ----Streptococcus, group A, invasive - USA (AZ): spread to HCW 20050308.06922002 ----Streptococcus group A, invasive - USA (FL) 20021203.5953Streptococcus, group A, invasive - Canada (BC) 20020115.32672000---- Streptococcus group A, invasive - USA (Ohio) 20000307.0310].................................................ml/ec/jh"
