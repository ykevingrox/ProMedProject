Springer YP et al. Two Outbreaks of Trichinellosis Linked to Consumption of Walrus Meat -- Alaska. MMWR 2017;66(26): 692-6. [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6626a3.htm?s_cid=mm6626a3_e>During July 2016-May 2017, 2 outbreaks of trichinellosis (5 cases each) associated with consumption of raw or undercooked walrus meat occurred in Alaska. Walrus meat has been implicated in half of all trichinellosis cases reported in Alaska since 1975, yet the frequency of walrus-associated trichinellosis in the state has declined in recent years for unknown reasons. The 2 recent outbreaks were the 1st associated with consumption of walrus meat since 2002 and the 1st multiple-case outbreaks since 1992.Wild game consumption should be considered when evaluating suspected trichinellosis cases. Related public health messaging should be culturally sensitive to traditional methods of food handling and preparation.Corresponding author: Louisa Castrodale, Section of Epidemiology, Alaska Division of Public Health; 2Epidemic Intelligence Service, CDCLouisa.castrodale@alaska.govReferences1.

Outbreaks has also been reported from Greenland (Moller LN et al. Outbreak of trichinellosis associated with consumption of game meat in West Greenland. Vet Parasitol. 2005;132:131-6). Seals are a common part of the food in the arctic and seals can be infected with _Trichinella nativa_ (Kapel CM et al. Experimental Trichinella infection in seals.
