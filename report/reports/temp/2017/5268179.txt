CBC News [edited]<http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/mosquito-responsible-for-majority-of-zika-infections-found-in-canada-for-first-time-1.4257135>An adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the species responsible for the majority of human Zika virus cases, has been found in Canada for the 1st time. Evidence shows mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika virus may have [a] colony in Ontario.Staff from the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit recently found the insect in a trap, a discovery health officials believe signals the species is becoming established in southern Ontario. ""It was just in such good shape, we are absolutely 100 per cent sure of what species it is,"" said Fiona Hunter, from Brock University, who heads up the lab that tested Windsor's mosquitoes. ""It didn't just blow in from the (United) States.""Last week [week ending 20 Aug 2017], the health unit revealed 2 _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, had also been found in the area. ""Once they establish themselves here it would be more difficult to control and maybe we'll see some diseases we haven't seen before,"" said Dr Wajid Ahmed, the region's acting medical officer of health, at the time.Having the Asian tiger [mosquito] show up in Canada was a bit of a surprise, considering it wasn't expected to migrate north for at least another decade, Hunter explained. But the odds of it arriving is still higher than the latest species. ""The Asian tiger mosquito is known to exist farther north in the (United) States ... but _Aedes aegypti_ is supposed to be sub-tropical [and tropical - Mod.TY], so what on earth is it doing here?""All aedes mosquitoes found in Windsor-Essex so far have tested negative for both the Zika and West Nile virus. Given there are no active cases of the diseases, there's less cause for alarm, according to Hunter. ""I think it's alarming -- for the country -- that our climate is changing,"" she said. ""In the last decade we've added another 10 mosquito species to our endemic list ... so we know something is going on.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although finding _Aedes aegypti_ in southern Canada is a surprise, one should remember that this tropical and sub-tropical species became seasonally established along the east coast of the USA and was responsible for yellow fever outbreaks in northern cities such as Philadelphia more than 200 years ago. However, it will not become established in Canada for the same reason it has not become established in the north central and north east states of the USA.However, _Aedes albopictus_ distribution is another matter. This species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin, 3 of which border Ontario across the Great Lakes . Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. A University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out that viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states and it seems unlikely that they will in Ontario either. However, continued surveillance for both is prudent. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>.]
