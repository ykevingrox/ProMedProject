Investigation and active case search ongoing in affected States with coordination of response activities by the NCDC with support from partners.1.5.1. National Lassa Fever Working Group meeting and weekly National Surveillance and Outbreak Response meeting on-going at NCDC to keep abreast of the current Lassa fever situation in the country.1.5.2. Response materials for VHFs prepositioned across the country by NCDC at the beginning of the dry season1.5.3. New VHF guidelines have been developed by the NCDC (Interim National Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Preparedness guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures for Lassa fever management)1.5.4. Ongoing reclassification of reported Lassa fever cases1.5.5. Ongoing review of the variables for case-based surveillance for VHF1.5.6. VHF case-based forms completed by affected States are being entered into the new VHF management system. This system allows for the creation of a VHF database for the country.1.5.7. NCDC team sent to Edo State to support Lassa fever data harmonization and updating of VHF case-based management database1.5.8. Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment/isolation centers across the States with Ribavirin and necessary supportive management also instituted1.5.9. Onsite support was earlier provided to Ogun, Nasarawa, Taraba, Ondo and Borno States by the NCDC and partners1.5.10. Offsite support provided by NCDC/partners in all affected States1.5.11. States are enjoined to intensify surveillance and promote Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in health facilities.Table of cases as of 16 Jun 2017Cases during week 23: 3 cases, deaths 0Cumulative weeks 1- 23: 301, deaths 49[Cases by state not given in thei Epidemiological Report]--Communicated by:Olutayo Olajide BabalobiLecturer and Consultant Epizootiologist(One Health, Participatory Epizootiology and Veterinary ICT Research Group)Department of Veterinary Public Health and Preventive MedicineFaculty of Veterinary MedicineUniversity of IbadanIbadan, Nigeria<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>[During week 23, there were just 3 new suspected cases. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.Images of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at <http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877>.Once again, Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi is thanked for sending in the above Epidemiological Report.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>.]
