EpiCentro [in Italian, trans machine and Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.epicentro.iss.it/problemi/Chikungunya/FocolaioCalabria2017.asp>Martina Del Manso, Marco Di Luca, Francesco Severini, Daniela Boccolini, Claudia Fortuna, Patrizio Pezzotti, Maria Elena Remoli, Flavia Riccardo, Caterina Rizzo, Luciano Toma, Giulietta Venturi, Giovanni. A focus of chikungunya [virus infection] in Calabria (2017).After the local chikungunya [fever] cases reported in Lazio, a new outbreak has been identified in Calabria. Everything started from 4 cases reported between 19 - 25 Sep 2017 - one in Lazio and 3 in Emilia-Romagna - involving people resident in these regions who had developed indicative symptoms of infection last August [2017] acquired while they were in Guardavalle Marina (CZ). These cases were positive by laboratory tests.On 24 Sep [2017], a team of the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Superior Health Institute (ISS), consisting of entomologists and epidemiologists, went to Guardavalle Marina to investigate the epidemic focus, collect samples from people to confirm the infection, monitor the vector _Aedes albopictus_ (tiger mosquito) and provide support for mosquito control of the affected areas. Through the retrospective epidemiological survey, in the period August-September 2017, 55 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) of chikungunya fever were reported by general practitioners (Mmg) and private practice pediatricians (PLs) in the Guardavalle area (Figure 1 [showing the epidemic curve]).All cases report high fever, joint pain (often disabling) frequently accompanied by skin rash. For 6 suspected cases, laboratory diagnosis has been made, and the cases now have been confirmed. Epidemiological and microbiological assessments are underway to confirm the diagnosis in [other] suspected cases and to assess whether this outbreak is related to that observed in Lazio.Around the areas of residence and domicile of the cases, vector monitoring activities were performed and mosquito larvae and adult specimens of _Ae. albopictus_ were taken. Agreements have also been made to carry out monitoring activities with ovitraps on the Guardavalle Marina area and mapping the larval foci in the area. For captured mosquitoes, tests are ongoing to verify the presence of the virus.From the preliminary information collected, it seems that there are no other municipalities of interest at present. However, the Region has sent an alert to all Mgg, Pls, First Aid and Local Medical Guard posts to alert them to the diagnosis and for reporting of patients presenting with clinical symptoms that may suggest chikungunya [fever] disease.On 29 Sep [2017], the National Blood Center (CNS) announced the suspension of the collection of blood donations from donors in the Guardavalle City Council municipality and to all those who stayed for a few hours in this area during the period considered.--Communicated by:Remigio RussoProfessional Journalist<remigiorusso@tin.it>[This report identifies an additional focus of chikungunya virus infection in Italy, this one in the south of the country. Surveillance is being increased in this focus in order to detect additional cases and vector control measures are being implemented. The comment in the previous post indicated that transmission of chikungunya virus appears to be ongoing, as the confirmed and suspected case count increased to 183. New cases will likely continue to occur as long as warm weather lasts. The European Early Warning Response System is in place and is important for notifying neighboring countries to be on the alert for cases.Remigio Russo is thanked for sending in this report to ProMED-mail.Maps of Italy showing the regions mentioned can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_admin_06.jpg> and a HealthMap/Promed-mail map of Italy at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63107>. - Mod.TY]
