Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/09/new-klebsiella-strains-worst-case-scenario-experts-say>Infectious disease experts are calling the emergence of hypervirulent, multidrug-resistant and highly transmissible strains of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ described in a recent paper by Chinese scientists an alarming and worrisome development that could be a sign of things to come.The paper, published last week in the Lancet Infectious Diseases [1,2], described a ventilator-associated pneumonia outbreak among 5 patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) at a hospital in Hangzhou, China. The 5 patients, who had suffered severe trauma from car accidents and other incidents, developed pneumonia after undergoing multiple surgeries, did not respond to any antibiotic treatment, and died over the course of several weeks from severe lung infection, multi-organ failure, or septic shock.Further investigation of the cases revealed that the pneumonia had been caused by strains of _K. pneumoniae_ bacteria that are a common cause of infection in Asia but unlike any the investigators had previously seen in healthcare settings, harboring both antibiotic resistance genes and hypervirulence genes, a combination of _K. pneumoniae_ that causes severe, quick-developing, and deadly infections and is nearly impossible to treat with currently available drugs.The authors of the paper called these new strains, which they also found in a small percentage of _K. pneumoniae_ samples from other Chinese hospitals, a ""real superbug"" that is an imminent threat to public health. The authors of an accompanying commentary called the findings ""an alarming evolutionary event."" And experts who've spoken with CIDRAP News about the study share these concerns.""The fatal outbreak of a hypervirulent and hyper-resistant strain of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in a Chinese ICU represents a worst-case scenario in which both resistance elements and virulence factors appeared in the same strain of bacteria,"" Amesh Adalja, MD, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said. ""The situation highlights the dire threat of antibiotic resistance and is a harbinger of the future if current trends continue.""Ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by drug-resistant bacteria is fairly common in healthcare facilities, especially among patients with severely compromised immune systems. And such infections can frequently be deadly, with mortality rates as high as 50%. But Sheng Chen, PhD, lead author of the study and a microbiologist at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said that the pneumonia in these 5 patients was different. ""We felt that the pneumonia in these patients was more severe than typical pneumonia infections,"" he said.Chen and his colleagues identified the _K. pneumoniae_ bacteria that were the underlying cause of the infections as belonging to sequence type (ST) 11, a lineage that's responsible for 60% of _K. pneumoniae_ infections in Asia and is known to harbor genes that confer resistance to carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics. And they all appear to have emerged and spread from a single clone found in an index patient, who was admitted to the ICU in February 2016.Molecular analysis of the _K. pneumoniae_ samples from the 5 patients showed that they contained several antibiotic resistance genes, and laboratory tests confirmed what doctors had reported: that the bacteria were also extremely virulent, a trait not typically associated with ST11 strains.That's because, as further genomic analysis revealed, the bacteria were carrying virulence genes associated with hypervirulent strains of _K. pneumoniae_, which have emerged globally in recent years but are less common than ST11 and other _K. pneumoniae_ strains that cause healthcare-associated infections (often referred to as ""classical"" _K. pneumoniae_ strains). The genes were found on plasmids, which are small, highly mobile pieces of DNA that can be shared among bacteria.""In this case, it looks like the virulence factors went from the hypervirulent strains into an extensively drug-resistant strain,"" said Thomas Russo, MD, an infectious disease expert at the University of Buffalo's Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. ""This is exactly what we were concerned about and that we thought would have a high likelihood of coming to fruition.""Russo, whose research focuses on gram-negative bacteria, has become familiar with hypervirulent _K. pneumoniae_ strains in recent years, co-authoring several studies. What's different and scary about the hypervirulent strains of the bacterium, he explained, is that they tend to cause disease in the community among otherwise healthy people. In addition, they can spread very quickly to anywhere in the body from the initial site of infection, which is ""extraordinarily unusual"" for gram-negative bacteria like _Klebsiella_, he said.Russo has been concerned about the potential merging of these two types of _K. pneumoniae_ because of horizontal gene transfer, the process through which bacteria acquire plasmid-mediated resistance and virulence genes. The question he has is whether the ST11 _K. pneumoniae_ strains described in the Chinese study have acquired all the genes on the virulence plasmid and become fully hypervirulent.In addition, he worries about fully hypervirulent strains acquiring resistance mutations, a development that could give rise to extremely drug-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ infections in relatively healthy people.""You can imagine the genetic material could go in either direction, with the hypervirulent strains acquiring plasmids that contain the resistance genes,"" he said.To date, hypervirulent _K. pneumoniae_ strains have not appeared to be resistant to antibiotics. And in general, Adalja added, most infectious disease experts believe that highly antibiotic resistant bacteria tend to be less virulent because there is usually a fitness cost associated with resistance mutations. That's one of the noteworthy developments highlighted by the Lancet paper. ""The Chinese cases highlight that this is not necessarily the case and this combination of traits can exist, and when it does, it is harrowing,"" Adalja said.To get a better sense of whether the _K. pneumoniae_ strains that infected the patients were in other hospitals, Chen and his colleagues noted in their Lancet paper that they conducted a retrospective analysis of 387 clinical ST11, carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ isolates from hospitals in 25 Chinese provinces and municipalities. They found that only 11 (3%) also carried the virulence plasmid. Five of those patients died, and 6 were discharged with critical illnesses.While the overall prevalence of hypervirulent, drug-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ in China appears to be low, Chen said, what he and his colleagues are worried about is that it will likely increase in Chinese hospitals, presenting clinicians with more severe infections that don't respond to the current arsenal of antibiotics.But with few new antibiotics in the pipeline, physicians will be forced to keep using what they have, which will only hasten the further emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, said David van Duin, MD, PhD, an antimicrobial resistance researcher at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. ""Emergence of combined increased virulence and resistance will force doctors to treat patients even more broadly upfront with last-line antibiotics, thus inducing additional resistance,"" he said.And if the rapid global spread of the resistance gene MCR-1 is any example, these types of infections won't be limited to China. The plasmid-mediated gene, which confers resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin, was identified in _Escherichia coli_ bacteria in China in 2015 and, since then, has been detected in more than 30 countries. Other antibiotic resistance genes have demonstrated similar ability to spread rapidly via horizontal gene transfer. The genes and plasmids, and the bacteria that carry them, know no boundaries. ""Multidrug-resistant organisms in one part of the world are a threat to patients everywhere,"" van Duin said.[Byline: Chris Dall][1. Gu D, Dong N, Zheng Z, et al.

However, a distinctive syndrome caused by _K. pneumoniae_ was 1st seen in Taiwanese patients in the 1980's (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7613255?dopt=Abstract>). Cases have since been reported worldwide.The syndrome is characterized by life-threatening community-acquired _K. pneumoniae_ infection in relatively healthy hosts that includes liver abscess and bacteremia complicated by the ability of the responsible _K. pneumoniae_ to spread hematogenously to the lungs, brain, meninges, eyes, prostate, bones, joints, and psoas (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732457/>). Approximately half of the reported patients had diabetes mellitus, with the remainder displaying no apparent underlying diseases. The _K. pneumoniae_ strains were susceptible to many antibiotics, but mortality rates were as high as 10% for liver abscess and 30-40% for those with metastatic meningitis.Colonies of the strains causing this illness were noted to be unusually mucoviscous with a positive ""string test,"" defined as the formation of a mucoviscous string of over 5 mm in length when using a bacteriology inoculation loop to touch and stretch a colony grown overnight on an blood agar plate at 35 C [95 F] (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685062/>). The strains were called hypervirulent _K. pneumoniae_ or hvKP, and their capsular polysaccharide serotypes were found to be either K1 or K2. Whole genome sequencing indicated that the hypervirulent K1 isolates belonged to clonal complex 23 (CC23) that grouped into a distinct monophyletic clade, with global spread by multiple international transmissions (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199326>). The hvKP carried siderophores, which confer the ability to more efficiently acquire iron in iron poor environments. A large virulence plasmid, which encodes the siderophores and a regulator of the mucoid phenotype, was detected in all hvKP clonal lineages (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199326>). The latest development noted in the above report is the acquisition of the virulence plasmid by multidrug resistant hospital-associated ST11 _K. pneumoniae_._Klebsiella_ have been known to develop multiple antimicrobial drug resistance, commonly due to production of beta-lactamases that destroy the class of beta-lactam antibiotics known as carbapenems, as well as all other beta-lactam antibiotics. These carbapenemases are referred to as KPCs, that is, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases. Some multidrug resistant strains have also been found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The genes that encode KPCs and ESBLs are plasmid-mediated, which readily facilitates horizontal gene transfer between bacteria. The genes that encode these beta-lactamases are often linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics. The principal reservoir for these organisms is the gastrointestinal tract, and spread occurs from there on the contaminated hands of healthcare workers and environment.Hangzhou, with a population of 9 million in 2015, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou>). Zhejiang is an eastern coastal province of China, bordered by Jiangsu province and Shanghai municipality to the north and Fujian province to the south (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/352>.]
