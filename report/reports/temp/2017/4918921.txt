Qatar Ministry of Public Health<https://www.moph.gov.qa/news/moph-announces-new-mers-cov-case?backArt=326>MOPH announced a new Corona case--------------------------------The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has announced that a new Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) case has been confirmed in a 62 years old resident in Qatar, marking the 1st MERS-CoV case to be confirmed in the country this year [2017] and bringing the cumulative number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases since 2012 to 19 cases, among whom, 7 have died.The patient, with history of comorbid conditions, had fever, night sweating, and abdominal pain several days ago and was seen at Hamad General Hospital where he tested positive for MERS-CoV. The patient is currently in stable condition and receives the necessary medical care in the isolation ward according to the national protocol of the infection prevention and control. The preliminary investigations inform that there was neither a history of contact with a suspected case nor a travel during the recent couple of weeks. Once the case has been confirmed, the rapid response team of the Health Protection and Communicable disease Control department at the MOPH have started a field investigation to identify the possible source of the infection and to verify whether any of the patient contacts has suspected symptoms according to the WHO standard case definition, all traced contacts will be monitored over a period of 2 weeks.The Ministry of Public Health advices citizens and residents who have chronic diseases to wash hands with soap and water thoroughly. MOPH proclaimed that Health Protection & CDC Hotlines 66740948 & 66740951 are accessible 24/7 to respond to any notification or enquiry related to infectious diseases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the absence of a history of travel or direct contact with camels in the 2 weeks preceding onset of illness, questions that arise are whether there was contact with other individuals who may have been infected but not diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection. We await further information from the Qatar MOPH on results of their investigation. This case may well be a window into the ""primary cases"" with no known history of high risk exposure that have been reported elsewhere.As stated above, there have been 18 previous cases of MERS-CoV infected individuals including 7 deaths reported by Qatar, and 2 additional cases reported from Europe in individuals possibly infected in Qatar, including the 2nd recognized case of MERS-CoV internationally treated in the UK (see Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (03): UK HPA, WHO, Qatar 20120923.1305982).The HealthMap/ProMED map of Qatar can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/130>. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia, 4 cases, 12-21 Mar 2017 - Saudi MOHDate: Wed 22 Mar 2017Source: Saudi MOH 12-21 Mar 2017 [edited]<http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx?PageIndex=1>As of 14:00 [2:00 PM] yesterday [Tue 21 Mar 2017], there have been a total of:1577 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including656 deaths [reported case fatality rate 41.6 per cent],907 recoveries, and14 currently active cases.[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website.
