During the month of May [2017], there were 3 healthcare workers from Riyadh also found to be asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected individuals.In addition, there is a hospital visitor in Jeddah who was identified as a symptomatic individual with laboratory confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV. Presumably with documented contact with the case reported on 25 May 2017. To the best of my knowledge, this is the 1st case confirmed in a hospital visitor identified on the Saudi MOH website. The other reported contact cases were in either healthcare workers or household contacts.Maps showing the locations of these newly confirmed infected individuals can be found at the source URL.
