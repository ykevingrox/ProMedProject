BBC News [edited]<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-38563188>A man has died, and 14 others have tested positive for a respiratory virus at a cancer centre in Glasgow. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) said the man who died at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre had already been giving cause for concern. Visitors with colds and flu-like symptoms have been asked to stay away from the Beatson to prevent the spread of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Four of the patients have been discharged. Ten patients remain in 2 wards, but they are not said to be giving any cause for concern. In December 2015, 3 patients at the same centre died after contracting the virus.In-patients at the Beatson are ""particularly susceptible to viruses,"" prompting the NHS to ask that any visitors who have experienced cold or flu-like symptoms avoid visiting friends and family until at least 48 hours after the end of symptoms. Visitors who do not have cold or flu symptoms have been asked to observe temporary visiting times of 14:00-16:00 and 18:00-20:00. Dr Teresa Inkster, consultant microbiologist and infection control doctor at NHSGGC, said: ""If you have any cold or flu-like symptoms, please do not visit loved ones in the Beatson until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have cleared up. ""All visitors are being urged to remember the importance of hand hygiene when entering and leaving hospital premises."" Dr Inkster also expressed her sympathies for the family of the patient who died.Wards with patients showing symptoms will not be admitting new patients as a precautionary measure, and the wards are being closely monitored with strict infection control measures in place.RSV is a viral illness that normally resembles a cold and is self-limiting. It is particularly prevalent at this time of year and is common in the community. It is more common in young children but can occur in people of all ages. It is spread by tiny droplets and sneezing or by touching surfaces with the virus on it.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection commonly causes a mild, cold-like illness, bronchitis and croup with low grade fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, sneezing, cough, and wheezing. Otherwise healthy infants and children are most commonly involved, having been exposed to RSV outside the home, in day-care centers or schools. They are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days, when they can then transmit the virus via respiratory secretions to other members of the family. However, very young infants and children with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus for up to 4 weeks. Environmental surfaces such as a doorknob contaminated by respiratory secretion can also transmit infection. RSV can survive on these surfaces for many hours.RSV may also cause lower respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia in 25% to 40% of infected infants and young children (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14615709>). RSV bronchopulmonary infections in hospitalized children can be associated with super-infection in the lower airways with bacteria, commonly due to _Haemophilus influenzae_ and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20700753>). Symptomatic RSV infections in adults are generally less severe than in children. Most people infected with RSV will recover in 1-2 weeks. Reinfection with RSV occurs at all ages; recurrent infections are more likely to be limited to the upper respiratory tract and be less severe.More severe illness can occur in premature infants and adults with chronic lung, heart disease or immunosuppression and adults 65 years of age or older, which may require hospitalization for oxygen therapy, intubation, and/or mechanical ventilation (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa043951>).Rapid diagnostic assays that detect antigen in respiratory secretions and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are now commercially available. The highly sensitive RT-PCR assays are particularly useful in older children and adults who may have low viral loads in their respiratory specimens.Bronchodilators are frequently administered via inhalation in an attempt to treat the bronchospasm in those with bronchiolitis. Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent in vitro, is licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the aerosolized treatment of children with severe RSV disease.There is no vaccine available to prevent RSV infection. Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to prevent severe RSV illness in high-risk infants and young children. It is given in monthly intramuscular injections during the RSV season, which generally occurs during fall, winter and spring in most locations in the United States and other areas with similar climates. However, it is not useful to treat existing RSV infection.The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre is a specialised care center for non-surgical treatment of cancer in Glasgow, Scotland (<http://www.beatson.scot.nhs.uk/content/default.asp?page=s40>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/280>.]
