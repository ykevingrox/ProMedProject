The young children caught the infection, which is believed to be spread by contact with bandicoot droppings, after playing at Warriewood Valley Rocket Park, in Casuarina Dr.Northern Sydney Local Health District director of public health Dr Michael Staff said he hoped to have contained the outbreak by advising the council to close the park quickly. ""We hope that the closure of the park will prevent further cases,"" he said. A sand sample taken from the playground was tested after 2 confirmed _Salmonella_ Java cases were reported to the public health unit. The 2 cases were children who became unwell in April 2017. One was reported to the health unit in late April 2017 and the other in early May 2017.They were unwell with fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Both have since made a full recovery without requiring hospital treatment. Apparently, the children played in the playground in the week prior to becoming unwell. Dr Staff said he believed they contracted the illness through ingesting contaminated sand. However, he suspected that the bacteria had been brought to the sandpit by infected children who were already sick, rather than bandicoot droppings in the sandpit. ""Once the bug is in the sand it can grow,"" he said.Part of the playground was closed last week [week 15 to 21 May 217] and now the whole playground is shut, with signs erected warning of the infection and barriers in place. A spokesperson from Northern Beaches Council said the sand would have to be removed and they were unsure whether to replace it.Dr Staff said the most important advice for parents of young children was to stop them putting their hands in their mouths when they're playing outside and to wash their hands after they have been outside. The Northern Sydney Local Health District said there are some simple steps people can take to reduce the risk of children coming into contact with bandicoot droppings including fence proofing and regularly maintaining your backyard.For further advice go to <environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/bandicoots.htm>.[Byline: Julie Cross]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Previous ProMED postings about such cases have implicated the strain of _Salmonella_ in past cases and here as the L (+) tartrate + variant of _S._ Paratyphi B that is sometimes referred to as _S._ Java. The classical _S._ Paratyphi B has the tartrate negative phenotype and is generally invasive causing an enteric fever-like illness similar to typhoid fever. Although the tartrate positive variant can be invasive, it generally is less invasive and is associated with diarrhea.The citation of the paper, published in the July 2012 issue is:Staff M, Musto J, Hogg G, Janssen M and Rose K: Salmonellosis outbreak traced to playground sand, Australia, 2007-2009.

It is the largest member of its genus, which also includes the eastern barred bandicoot and the desert bandicoot. The long-nosed bandicoot is much less colourful than its relatives, being primarily a brown color. It is distributed along the eastern coast of Australia from Cairns in Queensland to Naringal in southwestern Victoria. It is a nocturnal, solitary predator of invertebrates and tubers. The bandicoot (<http://australian-animals.net/bandi.htm>) has 2 features which place it apart from other marsupials (mammals that carry their young in pouches):1) Having many incisor teeth, as do all insect and flesh eating marsupials2) Their 2nd and 3rd toes are grown together (like the kangaroo).Bandicoots hop around like kangaroos on their larger hind legs though they are much smaller ranging from 6 inches to 22 inches in length. Depending on the species their fur can be orange, greyish, or brown or striped.A picture of the animal can be found at: <http://wildlife-australia.com/lbandicoot.htm>. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/284>.]
