AllAfrica, The Herald report [edited]<http://allafrica.com/stories/201709060179.html>The country has contained an anthrax outbreak that killed one person and infected 56 in April this year [2017], when villagers in Binga [Matabeleland North] ate meat from infected dead hippos. According to the Ministry of Health and Child Care, no new cases of anthrax have been reported since June [2017]. ""The Ministry of Health and Child Care weekly disease surveillance report revealed that no new suspected cases of anthrax were reported during the week ending 20 Aug 2017,"" reads the report.""The cumulative figures for anthrax are 57 cases and one death."" Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals.Anthrax-infected hippos started dying from [27 Mar 2017] and some people ate meat from their carcasses after they were found dead in Binga's Mlibizi area.Chief Saba of Binga had urged the Government to help urgently contain the anthrax outbreak which killed one person and 16 hippos in his area. He said many people including his family ate meat from the dead hippos.[Byline: Thandeka Moyo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There is no mention of further wildlife deaths so I think we can presume that Mr Moyo's claim of containment refers only to the human cases. Interestingly, the previous report (11 May 2017 Anthrax - Zimbabwe (06): (MN) human, wildlife 20170511.5028820) referred to 2 human deaths, 21 hippos dying (not 16), plus 2 young crocodiles. The absence of any comments on the specifics of wildlife losses probably comes about from reliance being placed on the update report from the Ministry of Health and Child Care.Maps of Zimbabwe can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/zimbabwe.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2956>.For a description of Matabeleland North on the western border of Zimbabwe with Zambia, go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matabeleland_North_Province>.
