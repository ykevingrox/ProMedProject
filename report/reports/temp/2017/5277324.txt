The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is advising tourists to go to hospital if they develop a high fever or generalized rash after returning to Japan.Although the World Health Organization verified that Japan has eliminated infections of endemic measles strains in 2015, group infections originating from people who contracted the disease abroad are spreading in the country. As of [6 Aug 2017], the number of patients reached 169 this year in Japan, already eclipsing the figure in the previous year.About 4100 patients in Italy and around 6500 patients in Romania have already been confirmed as of August [2017] compared with about 860 and 2000, respectively, throughout 2016, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Symptoms of the highly contagious disease include runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and rash. The virus is spread through coughing and sneezing and can cause complications such as pneumonia and can even result in death in one in 1000 patients, according to the ministry. The ministry recommends people traveling overseas to check their vaccination records and take an additional shot if they have only been vaccinated once.The disease was prevalent about a decade ago in Japan with the number of patients soaring to over 10 000 in 2008 but the country was later considered as free from infections of the virus.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Japan can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/156>. - Mod.LK]******[2] Australia (Perth, Western Australia): ex ItalyDate: Fri 25 Aug 2017 5:36 PM AESTSource: News.com.au, Australian Associated Press (AAP) report [edited]<http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/fourth-case-of-measles-at-perth-school/news-story/ece041f55111645e10f70046d92479dd>A 4th child has been diagnosed with measles at Perth Waldorf School [Western Australia], more than a week after the health department gave an on-site vaccine to students. A Health Department spokeswoman confirmed the latest case, which came 3 weeks after the highly contagious disease was first detected in an unvaccinated year 10 student who had returned from Italy.Revelations that about half the school's 400 students were unvaccinated against the disease led the Health Department to offer a voluntary, free on-site vaccine to students, but it is unknown how many took up the offer.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Australia can be seen at <http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gi> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62426>. - Mod.LK]******Europe---[3] Germany (Berlin): 2014-15Date: Thu 24 Aug 2017Source: Eurosurveillance edition 2017; 22(34) [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22861>ref: Werber D, Hoffmann A, Santibanez S, et al. Large measles outbreak introduced by asylum seekers and spread among the insufficiently vaccinated resident population, Berlin, October 2014 to August 2015. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(34): pii=30599----------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract--------The largest measles outbreak in Berlin since 2001 occurred from October 2014 to August 2015. Overall, 1344 cases were ascertained, 86 per cent (with available information) unvaccinated, including 146 (12 per cent) asylum seekers. Median age was 17 years (interquartile range: 4-29 years), 26 per cent were hospitalised and a 1 year old child died. Measles virus genotyping uniformly revealed the variant 'D8-Rostov-Don' and descendants. The virus was likely introduced by and initially spread among asylum seekers before affecting Berlin's resident population. Among Berlin residents, the highest incidence was in children younger than 2 years, yet most cases (52 per cent) were adults. Post-exposure vaccinations in homes for asylum seekers, not always conducted, occurred later (median: 7.5 days) than the recommended 72 hours after onset of the 1st case and reached only half of potential contacts. Asylum seekers should not only have non-discriminatory, equitable access to vaccination, they also need to be offered measles vaccination in a timely fashion, that is, immediately upon arrival in the receiving country. Supplementary immunisation activities targeting the resident population, particularly adults, are urgently needed in Berlin.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Germany can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5857>. - Mod.LK]******[4] RomaniaDate: Fri 25 August 2017Source: Romania Insider [edited]<https://www.romania-insider.com/measles-kills-iraqi-refugee/>The ongoing measles outbreak keeps making victims in Romania. A 10 month old girl, who was a refugee from Iraq, became the 33rd person to die of the infection, reports local Digi24. The girl arrived in Romania on [7 Jul 2017] with her family, and the doctors diagnosed her with measles in August. They also discovered that the child was suffering from malnutrition and severe psychomotor retardation.The measles outbreak is still a major problem in Romania, with more than 8900 cases reported across the country until [25 Aug 2017], including 33 deaths, according to data from the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). Most deaths were registered in Timis (9), Dolj (7), and Arad (6) counties.Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on WHO's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children pose the highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.The Romanian Government adopted earlier this month [August 2017] a draft bill on the organization and financing of population vaccination [<https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-draft-bill-vaccination/>]. The project was sent to the Parliament for approval and could come into force in January 2018.[byline: Irina Marica]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Measles tends to be more severe in children who are malnourished, especially children who are also vitamin A deficient. And complications are commoner and more serious in malnourished children. Because of complications such as diarrhoea, measles may lead to failure to thrive. Infection with measles virus may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get infected. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition.Maps of Romania can be found at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Mod.LK]******Measles immunity gaps---[5] Role of demographicsDate: Sat 26 Aug 2017Source: News-Medical/Life Sciences [edited]<https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170826/New-study-highlights-role-played-by-demographics-in-the-spread-of-measles.aspx>Even if the incidence of measles infection has decreased by at least 90 per cent worldwide since the introduction of the vaccine, measles is still one of the major causes of death in children among vaccine-preventable diseases. Regular measles epidemics are reported in developing countries and recurrent episodic outbreaks occur in the developed world.A new study by Bocconi University and Bruno Kessler Foundation analyzing 9 countries (Australia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [see reference below], highlights the role played by demographics in the spread of measles and concludes that future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunization rates, while immunization campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults are required in low fertility countries.Using a transmission model calibrated on historical serological data the authors estimate that the susceptible proportion of the population (that is, unprotected against the infection) varies from about 3 per cent in the UK to more than 12.5 per cent in Ethiopia, with astonishing differences in its age composition, due to different vaccination strategies and divergent demographic trends. While the percentage of over-15 among susceptible individuals in Ethiopia and Kenya is, respectively, 28 per cent and 43 per cent, adolescents and young adults represent 74 per cent of unprotected individuals in South Korea, 66 per cent in Italy and 53 per cent in the US, with considerable immunity gaps in individuals aged 30-40 years.""Every effort to increase the vaccination coverage rate among children is praiseworthy"", says Alessia Melegaro, a Bocconi professor and principal investigator of DECIDE, the ERC [European Research Council]-funded project which produced the article, ""but in some developed countries it's the lack of coverage among adolescents and adults that poses a serious threat to the goal of eliminating measles.""""Measles incidence could increase, in the next decades, in Italy, Australia, and Singapore and Ethiopia is at high risk of future large epidemics"", says Stefano Merler from Bruno Kessler Foundation, ""and this is particularly worrying considering that individuals get infected later in life when the disease is more severe. The median age at infection for 2015 was estimated to be 5-10 years in the UK, Ireland, and Ethiopia; 10-15 years in the USA, Australia, Singapore, and Kenya; and older than 20 years in Italy and South Korea"".The proposed model shows that the introduction of the measles vaccine, which occurred at different times in the 9 countries, has considerably reduced the disease burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a measure expressed as the number of years lost because of illness, disability, or early death. Every vaccine dose averts 2 or 3 weeks of DALYs in the developed world and around 20 weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia. Which translates into 2-mln years [2 million DALYs] since the vaccine introduction in the UK, 13-mln [13 million DALYs] in the US, and 36-mln [36 million DALYs] in Ethiopia.""Vaccination has undoubtedly achieved incredible results in terms of public health. In particular,"" continues Prof Melegaro ""our analysis showed that routine 1st dose vaccine administration has been responsible for more than 90 per cent of the overall number of vaccine-immunized individuals in most countries. In Ethiopia and Kenya, catch-up and follow-up campaigns substantially mitigated the effect of suboptimum routine vaccine coverage, generating 25-45 per cent of the immunized fraction of the population. Tailoring immunization campaigns to achieve measles eradication goals is essential and currently, for some countries, this means considering also the role of unprotected adolescents and young adults.""--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Reference----------Trentini F, Poletti P, Merler S, Melegaro A.
