Bay Of Plenty Times [edited]<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&objectid=11923656>Health authorities say 3 people have been diagnosed with mumps in Tauranga this month [September 2017]. However, there were concerns more people might unwittingly be carrying and passing on the virus.Toi Te Ora Public Health Organisation chief medical officer Neil de Wet said mumps could have serious health complications including swelling of the brain, loss of hearing, and potential infertility in young men, but these were rare.Dr de Wet said there had been an increase in mumps cases in New Zealand in the past year, but most of these were in Auckland [see next post]. Up until last week, there had been 3 confirmed cases in the Bay of Plenty District Health Board area.""In the past, our immunisation rates have been very low, so people who are now in those 2 age groups -- 10-19 and 20-29 -- historically had low immunisation rates. It's not surprising that we are seeing most cases in these age groups.""The Auckland Regional Public Health Service had been notified of 300 cases of mumps from 1 Jan-4 Sep this year [2017].Dr de Wet said because of the high mumps numbers nationally, it was hard to establish Auckland links to the local cases.""We do have mumps in our community, and people can be asymptomatic, especially younger children. They might not be symptomatic, so not every case will be diagnosed,"" Dr de Wet.Mumps symptoms include headaches, a general feeling of unwellness and swelling of the jaw area.""For most people, this is an unpleasant illness that will get better on its own after about a week.""Mumps can be spread from person to person throughout the air by coughing and sneezing. The MMR vaccine, which is part of routine childhood vaccines, prevents mumps as well as measles and rubella.Anyone who feels they might be sick or at risk is encouraged to phone their family doctor to arrange an appointment at a time unlikely to infect anyone else, Dr de Wet said.The last mumps epidemic in New Zealand was in 1994, with 188 hospitalisations. 20-30 cases of mumps were still notified each year; about half are in children under 10 years of age.Auckland medical officer of health Dr Josephine Herman said mumps was now at large in the local community, ""and the only way we can stop this spreading further is to achieve high levels of MMR vaccination in the population.""[Byline: Kiri Gillespie]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail of New Zealand can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164>.]******[2] New Zealand (Auckland)Date: Mon 25 Sep 2017Source: Stuff [edited]<https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/97197173/the-mumps-outbreak-continues-to-spread-at-a-rapid-rate-through-the-auckland-region>The mumps outbreak continues to spread at a rapid rate through the Auckland region, a sign of low vaccination rates, as the city deals with the most serious outbreak in more than 20 years.More than 440 cases have been reported in the region so far this year [2017], with about 5 per cent of those cases needing hospitalisation.Health authorities say the outbreak began in West Auckland and has now spread to south Auckland and across the region.The last similar outbreak of mumps was in 1994 when there were between 200-300 cases reported. Since then, only handfuls of cases were reported each year, many from overseas.Auckland Regional Public Health Service [ARPHS] medical officer of health Josephine Herman said she had seen mumps-related meningitis and testes inflammation.The most common complication of the current outbreak had been orchitis, which is inflammation of the testicles.The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries, and permanent deafness. It can also lead to infertility.The primary sign of mumps is swollen salivary glands that cause the cheeks to puff out; the term ""mumps"" is an old expression for lumps or bumps within the cheeks.Other symptoms include headache, muscle aches and pain while chewing or swallowing.ARPHS is warning that a large number of 10-29 year olds are not only at risk of mumps but also of measles and rubella due to some parents rejecting the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.The service said the ""lost generation"" of unprotected young people was partly due to the MMR controversy in the late 1990s, something which has been thoroughly discredited.Everyone needed to urgently check that they had had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine and to get immunised if they needed to, Herman said.[Byline: Shabnam Dastgheib]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Hawai'iDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017Source: The Garden Island [edited]<http://thegardenisland.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/largest-outbreak-in-years/article_35c8ed0e-4b4a-54be-8c8f-fb0a77855a12.html>It's been 40 years since the number of mumps cases has reached current levels in Hawaii, according to the state epidemiologist, Sarah Park.The Department of Health reported on Thu [21 Sep 2017] 384 confirmed cases of mumps for 2017, with 32 confirmed cases on Kauai, 334 on Oahu, 17 on Hawaii Island and one on Maui.The disease has been confirmed in adults and children, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, according to DOH.Park said she hasn't seen those kinds of numbers since the 1970s. It's not specifically associated with schools, and it's throughout the islands.""This is a community and statewide outbreak,"" said DOH spokeswoman Janice Okubo. ""Any cases in schools are only an indication of disease activity associated with that particular community.""In the past 9 years, Wilcox Medical Center has seen only 4 mumps cases, according to Faith Campbell, marketing manager for Wilcox Health. That's compared to the 30 confirmed on the island in just 2017.""We have definitely seen an increase this year [2017] in patients with mumps-related symptoms,"" she said.The most common symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, tiredness, and swollen glands in front of the ears or jaw on one or both sides. Mumps is best known for the puffy checks and swollen jaw that it causes, which is the result of these swollen glands, according to Wilcox Health.Some people who get mumps can have very mild or no symptoms, while others may feel sick but will not have swollen glands.""That is why it is important to consult your health care provider if you are experiencing any of these symptoms and stay at home to avoid spreading the disease to others,"" Campbell said.Mumps prevention comes in the form of a vaccine given in 2 doses. The 1st is generally administered at 12-15 months, and the 2nd is administered at 4-6 years old. DOH urges those who have had only one dose of the MMR vaccine to make an appointment to get the booster.[Byline: Jessica Else]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the US state of Hawai'i can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/214>.]******[4] Alaska (Anchorage)Date: Sat 23 Sep 2017Source: Alaska Dispatch News [edited]<https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/health/2017/09/22/13-confirmed-mumps-cases-in-anchorage-outbreak/>""We're currently experiencing a mumps outbreak in Anchorage, and right now, we have 13 confirmed cases,"" said Joe McLaughlin, state epidemiologist and chief of the section of epidemiology with the Department of Health and Social Services.It's the 1st outbreak in Alaska in decades. The last one was in 1995 in Kodiak, when 10 people were infected, according to the state.In the past 5 years, there have only been 3 cases reported, and all were from people who contracted the illness out of state, McLaughlin said.The current outbreak cases range from ages 14-58. About 60 percent have been among Anchorage's Pacific Islander population. And roughly half of the cases were in people who had received mumps vaccinations.""It's really important to note that if people were not vaccinated, our case counts would be much, much higher than they are,"" McLaughlin said.Mumps vaccinations, which come in 2 doses, are 88 percent effective in preventing the illness.[Byline: Laurel Andrews] --Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Because of the notable increase in mumps outbreaks globally, the panel of experts on vaccinations, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, has set up a working group to investigate the use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine in response to outbreaks and will recommend to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changes to mumps vaccination policy if the decision is made that this is scientifically justified.Suggested reading. Cardemil Cv et al. Effectiveness of a Third Dose of MMR Vaccine for Mumps Outbreak Control. N Engl J Med 2017; 377:947-956 7 Sep 2017 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1703309.Background. The effect of a 3rd dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in stemming a mumps outbreak is unknown. During an outbreak among vaccinated students at the University of Iowa, health officials implemented a widespread MMR vaccine campaign. We evaluated the effectiveness of a 3rd dose for outbreak control and assessed for waning immunity.Conclusions. Students who had received a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine had a lower risk of mumps than did those who had received 2 doses, after adjustment for the number of years since the 2nd dose. Students who had received a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine 13 years or more before the outbreak had an increased risk of mumps. These findings suggest that the campaign to administer a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine improved mumps outbreak control and that waning immunity probably contributed to propagation of the outbreak. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the US state of Alaska can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206>.]
