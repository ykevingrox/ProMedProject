El Heraldo [in Spanish trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.diarioelheraldo.cl/noticia/confirman-caso-de-virus-hanta-en-el-maule>The Public Health Institute (ISP) confirmed positive samples from a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] that affected a 23 year old worker from HualaÌ±Ì© [CuricÌ  Province, Maule Region] and who had been infected with this dangerous disease while he was working on a small farm in the Barandica area.The confirmation of the diagnosis was received by the Maule Regional Ministerial Health Secretary, Rafael Santander. ""The patient had all the protective [treatment] measures awaiting the confirmation of a positive diagnosis, and now presents practically no symptoms, has no fever, and has been sent to the hospital in HualaÌ±Ì©, where his treatment continues,"" said the health authority.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail posted 3 previous cases in the Maule region in 2016. The report above provides no specific details on the circumstances under which the man might have acquired his hantavirus infection. He may have been exposed to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment.Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57414>. - Mod.TY]
