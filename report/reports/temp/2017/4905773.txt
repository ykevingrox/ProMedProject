West Info [edited]<http://www.west-info.eu/hepatitis-a-outbreak-across-europe/>Since February 2016, 287 confirmed hepatitis A cases infected with distinct strains of sub-genotype IA virus have been reported by 13 EU countries; including 179 between June 2016 and February 2017, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).Most cases are reported among adult men who have sex with men (MSM), with only 9 women affected. An epidemic also involved Italy, where 69 cases were reported between August 2016 and February 2017 in 9 regions. Even in this country most cases were reported among men (87 percent) and especially among MSM (68 percent).Risk communication and vaccination are the 2 most effective ways to combat this problem, according to the Italian National Health Institute (ISS), which has recently released some useful indications about the matter.[Byline: Roberta Lunghini]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al: Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at <http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract>), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from ACIP are:Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:- men who have sex with men;- people who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs;- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11767>.]
