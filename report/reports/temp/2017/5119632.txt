It has affected 313 persons, mostly children, and claimed 10 lives in Odisha till the end of May this year [2017].While 3 deaths have been reported from Khurda district and 2 from Balasore, one each has died in Kendrapara, Jajpur, Nayagarh, Puri and Sambalpur.As per the statistics available from the directorate of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), no deaths have been reported from Japanese encephalitis (JE); though 313 AES cases have been diagnosed so far, 2 have been found to be JE positive.Odisha is, in fact, the 4th state -- after Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam -- which has recorded the maximum number of deaths due to AES. Uttar Pradesh has registered the highest number, 56 deaths, followed by 49 in WB and 32 in Assam. Though Tamil Nadu has registered the highest at 401 cases, no deaths have been reported in the southern state this year [2017].Joint Director of Health Services (NVBDCP) Dr MM Pradhan said AES is a growing concern in the country, as it is a clinical neurologic manifestation caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins.""Management of AES including JE is essentially symptomatic. It is important to identify early warning signs and refer patients to health facilities for treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Health workers have been educated for 1st line management of such cases at the grassroots level,"" he said.There are many AES-causing viruses for which neither vaccines nor medicines are available. In many cases, people affected with AES suffer from brain aspiration [meaning unclear - Mod.JH] and edema, which develop as a result of an inflammatory reaction in brain. It is difficult to survive if such cases are not treated early.The Health Department has alerted people to remain cautious, as early detection and treatment are 2 possible methods to put a check on AES. ""Since there is no particular medicine for the disease, we are adopting symptomatic treatment. Awareness activities have also been increased and health workers deployed at the periphery to spread awareness,"" Dr Pradhan said.After the spurt in AES and JE cases last year [2016], 10 sentinel laboratories were set up in the state for immediate diagnosis of blood samples. These laboratories have been provided with JE kits supplied by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology.The Health authorities have also planned to train all treating paediatric specialists to deal with encephalitis cases. They will be imparted training at AIIMS next month [June 2017].Last year [2016], out of 1096 AES cases, 115 persons died of AES, and 42 children died of JE. Most of the cases were reported from Malkangiri district. Along with Malkangiri, mass vaccination was carried out in Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Jajpur districts in campaign mode. The state government has written to the Centre for Vaccination in the rest of the 13 districts that have reported AES cases in the past.[Byline: Hemant Kumar Rout]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The JE virus transmission season is beginning in northeastern India. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis mentioned above and in other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology.AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus ( _O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.Maps of India can be accessed at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and for Odisha state at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/315>. - Mod.TY]
