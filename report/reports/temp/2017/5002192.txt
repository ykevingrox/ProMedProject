These isolated cases occurred in 1987, 1998, 2002 and 2009.""--Mark Bosson BVSc MVS [Epidemiology-Hons1]Technical Veterinarian - Production AnimalTechnical Department | Virbac New Zealand Ltd<mark.bosson@virbac.co.nz>******[2]Date: Fri 28 Apr 2017From: John Holmes <jd.holmes@otago.ac.nz> [edited]The above posting on ProMED-mail is history -- it was reported 100 years ago and quoted in the ""Hundred Years ago - from our archives"" section of Otago Daily Times. The details about opening the local hospital give an interesting insight into parochialism, which was common 100 years ago.Please could you give an urgent clarification to point out the New Zealand does not have diphtheria -- our latest immunisation coverage data show that 93.2 percent of children turning 5 years of age between 1 Jan and 31 Dec 2016 were fully immunised (4 doses of DTaP).--Dr John HolmesHonorary Clinical Session Lecturer, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago<jd.holmes@otago.ac.nz>[I appreciate Mark Bosson's and John Holmes' promptly pointing out that this article describes an event that occurred 100 years ago. Mark Bosson also reported that diphtheria has occurred very infrequently in New Zealand since 1979 (4 confirmed cases) and Dr Holmes reported that DTaP immunization coverage in children in 2016 is 93.2 percent.Others who also pointed out the error includeSuzanne McEvoy (<Suzanne.McEvoy@health.wa.gov.au>),Niklas Edner (<Niklas.Edner@unilabs.com>),James A Dickinson (<dickinsj@ucalgary.ca>), andMichael McShan (<William-Mcshan@ouhsc.edu>)We thank our readers for bringing this error to our attention and sincerely apologize to the readership for this error. - Mod.ML][See Also:Diphtheria - New Zealand: (OT) 20170427.4999847].................................................ml/mj/dk"
