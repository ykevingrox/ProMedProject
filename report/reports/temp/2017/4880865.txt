Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/toronto-mumps-outbreak-rises-18-54425/>In a follow-up on the mumps outbreak in Toronto, city health officials report 4 additional cases since the outbreak was 1st reported approximately one week ago.Currently, there have been 18 confirmed cases of mumps in Toronto in 2017 as of 1 Mar 2017, according to Toronto Public Health.The outbreak is primarily affecting young adults, 18 to 35 years of age. Earlier reports on the investigation note that many of these cases have frequented bars in the west downtown core of Toronto.The mumps virus is found in saliva and respiratory droplets. It is spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and coming into contact with a person's saliva by sharing drinks or utensils, food or water bottles, or by kissing. A major factor contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team or living in a dormitory with a person who has the mumps.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[As of 4 Mar 2017, another 5 cases of mumps have been confirmed in Toronto, bringing the total to 22 this year (2017) in Toronto.

Dr. Jennifer Russell said 2 cases of mumps have been confirmed in New Brunswick, along with an outbreak of whooping cough.""Certainly, right now is the time to get checked to see if your vaccines are up to date for yourself and for your children,"" Russell said.Three more mumps cases have been confirmed in Edmonton; Alberta's total has risen to 21.Russell said it's ""concerning"" to have mumps in the province. According to the New Brunswick Department of Health's Routine Immunization Schedule, adults born after 1970 should have a 2nd booster vaccine to ensure they are protected.""When we have a disease that has a vaccine that allows you to prevent it, we want people to get those vaccines because it's really, really important, not just for their own health or for their children's health, but also for the health of the people around them who either can't get immunized, or maybe the immunization didn't quite work as well for them,"" Russell said.She said that the more people who get vaccinated, the safer everyone is in New Brunswick.""I'm not able to disclose any demographic information at this time, but just to say that we do have 2 cases right now, and they are connected; there was some contact,"" Russell said.Complications from mumps can include meningitis, swollen testicles, and permanent deafness.Russell said there are no current cases of measles in New Brunswick but said it's something that can appear occasionally in the province.New Brunswickers are encouraged to check with their health care provider or contact public health offices for more information on whether they need to update their vaccinations.Dr. Russell said there is a current pertussis outbreak, more commonly known as whooping cough, in the Fredericton region.She told Global News that the regional medical officer of health will be sending out a note to health care providers.Russell said there is a whooping cough vaccination given to children, but noted adults also require a booster shot. She said there can be complications from whooping cough that could result in death.[Byline: Adrienne South]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a serious disease that can cause babies to stop breathing. It is a vaccine-preventable disease that without vaccination is a very contagious disease that is most serious for babies. People with whooping cough usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others. Parents, older siblings, or other caregivers can give whooping cough to babies without even knowing they have the disease.Young babies can get pneumonia (lung infection), and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.Babies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick. Babies get protection from whooping cough vaccines in 3 important ways:- Through the Mother when she gets the whooping cough vaccine in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.- By being surrounded with family members and caregivers who are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccine.- By getting all doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to CDC's recommended schedule [excerpted and edited from CDC].A map of Canada showing the location of New Brunswick province can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/269>.

This vaccination clinic is specifically for members of Southeast's Greek community, who health officials say have the greatest known risk factors and where the confirmed mumps cases are most concentrated.Students who are not members of a fraternity or sorority can get a 3rd MMR dose by visiting the Campus Health Clinic. ... Students who are not part of the Greek community have a lower risk of contracting mumps based upon currently confirmed and suspected cases.The reports at Southeast come on the heels of a mumps outbreak on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia reported this past fall [2016]. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, 350 confirmed and probable cases of mumps have been reported as of 23 Feb 2017.According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the majority of cases continue to be reported among university students; 14 other colleges and universities across the State of Missouri have reported confirmed or suspected cases of mumps since August 2016.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There has been an increasing number of reports of mumps cases on campuses in the US because of the lifestyle of students and their age, which reflects time since a 2nd vaccination with MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses. More than 5000 cases of mumps were reported last year, 2016, in the United States, of which 19 outbreaks occurred on college campuses. This is the most in a decade. But importantly, even with infection with the mumps virus, those who have been vaccinated have fewer severe complications. A 3rd vaccine dose is being considered as a preventative measure. There is some evidence that this additional dose may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. - Mod.LK]******[5] Comment in response to RFI in ProMED-mail posts Mumps update (05) & (06)Date: Sun 5 Mar 2017From: Kamran Kadkhoda <kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com> [edited][Dr. Kadkhoda is responding to the RFI concerning the high incidence of mumps in previously vaccinated individuals, particularly young adults. From his response below, there clearly are a number of avenues to pursue to more fully understand the problem. ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kadkhoda for his response. - Mod.LK]:The best explanation so far is secondary vaccine failure/waning immunity: during the 1st decade or so after the vaccine, which uses genotype A strains, there's adequate cross-neutralization across different mumps genotypes, but after neutralization, capacity against non-A genotypes such as G wanes, then people may come down with clinical mumps. It'll be intriguing to see whether sub-neutralizing anti-mumps antibody levels help a new infection establish itself through antibody-dependent enhancement. It is also known that some HLA haplotypes play a role even in primary vaccine failure. All in all, significant pathogen inoculum should be another important factor on top of those mentioned above.--Kamran Kadkhoda, Ph.D., D(ABMM), D(ABMLI)Assistant Professor - Clinical MicrobiologistCadham Provincial Public Health LaboratoryAdjunct Professor - Department of ImmunologyUniversity of ManitobaInvestigator at Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba (CHRIM)<kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com>
