She [had been] treated as a typhoid fever locally without clinical improvement.Clinically she had conjunctival injection with laboratory finding of transaminitis and thrombocytopenia. There was no history of travel. Serology for leptospirosis, dengue, [brucellosis] and malaria were negative without growth in blood culture. IgM Elisa for scrub typhus [was] positive. She started with doxycycline and fever is responding.This case might be the 1st reported case from Nepal in 2017. Scrub typhus surged in Nepal following [the] earthquake in 2015. It might be in part [due to the] availability of diagnostic laboratory facilities and people staying in the temporary shelter infested by rodents. Treatment with simply available antibiotics [is] quite effective; however, delay in diagnosis and proper management can be fatal in scrub typhus.--Dr Anup Bastola, MD, MCTM,Consultant Tropical Medicine PhysicianSukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital,Teku, KathmanduNepal<docanup11@gmail.com>[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Bastola for this submission.There have been prior reports on scrub typhus cases in Nepal earlier this year (see prior ProMED-mail posts, Scrub typhus - Nepal (02): (RO) 20170217.4846555 and Scrub typhus - Nepal: winter season 20170111.4757908).Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of a 6-legged chigger, the larval form of the trombiculid family of 8-legged mites. Chiggers are most active during warmer summer months (<https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2000/06/got-chiggers-it-figures>). Chiggers live in shaded grassy areas and tend to be more abundant during rainy spells because they need a high-level of humidity in order to survive. During the heat of the afternoon or during long dry spells, they may retreat toward the moist soil. Once chiggers have fed on humans, they drop off of their host and transform into nymphs, which then develop into adult mites that feed on plant material and are harmless to humans.Bara District, with a population (2011) of 687 708 residents is located in south central Nepal; its climate is mainly lower tropical (below 300 meters or 1000 ft.)
