GNN Liberia [edited]<http://gnnliberia.com/2017/05/01/scaring-two-contacts-greenville-victims-confirmed-dead-monrovia/>Health authorities have reported 2 deaths in Monrovia from the strange disease that hit Greenville in Sinoe County last week.The communication director of the Ministry of Health, Mr Sorbor George, told local radio on Monday [1 May 2017] that one of the dead persons was among 60 persons who went to Greenville, Sinoe County from Monrovia to attend a funeral where the victims of the strange disease are said to have contracted it.According to George, the 2nd victim to die from the disease in Monrovia is the fiancÌ© [likely to be fiancÌ©e. - Mod.SH] of the man who died from the disease following his return from Greenville. He said the deaths of the 2 bring the toll from the disease to 12, and the total number of persons who have contracted the illness to 21. George stressed that 10 of the deaths occurred in Greenville, while the other 2 happened in the capital Monrovia. He said the health ministry has launched a massive search for all 60 Monrovia residents who attended the funeral in Greenville in order to place them in isolation for observation.He reiterated that initial tests have proved that the deaths are not Ebola-related, and that Lassa fever tests have also proved that the deaths are not related to Lassa fever. Meanwhile, George has reiterated his call on all Liberians, no matter where they live, to alert heath authorities or report to health centers relatives who show symptoms of vomiting, stomach ache and diarrhea. He also reminded Liberians to continue to abide by measures like handwashing and reporting sick and dead relatives to health ministry authorities in communities to prevent the spread of diseases.George told journalists that blood samples of victims of the disease have been sent to Atlanta, Georgia (United States) for testing, while Liberian health authorities have appealed to the World Health Organization (WHO) to help in conducting an investigation into the causes of the deaths.[byline: Cholo Brooks]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The total death toll has now increased by one to 12 since the last report. This report raises an important question: is this disease transmissible? Apparently, a man who was exposed in Greenville passed the etiological agent to his fiancÌ©e. Although not explicitly stated, the report implies that the fiancÌ©e had not traveled outside of Monrovia, and that the exposure, therefore, must have been via the man who had been in Greenville. It will be interesting to see whether other secondary cases appear.Maps of Liberia can be accessed at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/liberia/li2r765a/liberia_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41137>. - Mod.TYMany thanks to the several correspondents who sent us this report subsequently. - Mod.SHA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54>.]
