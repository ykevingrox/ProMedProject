Enterovirus Infections: Global Status, 2017. 139 pages, 67 graphs, 2534 references. Gideon e-books, <https://www.gideononline.com/ebooks/disease/enterovirus-infections-global-status/>.--Steve BergerTel Aviv Medical Center<steve@gideononline.com>[ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for this very informative figure.It is assumed the data include all enteroviruses that cause HFMD, including polio virus, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. It would be interesting to see a breakdown by virus to determine whether one is most responsible for the significant increase in case numbers observed. The risk factors that might explain the current increase are likely demographic and spatial as well as environmental (particularly weather). Intermixing of asymptomatically infected children in schools might also contribute to the spread of HFMD. - Mod.LKHealthMaps:Thailand: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/151>Ban Tak, Tak, Thailand: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63089>][See Also:Hand, foot & mouth disease update (08): Thailand (BT) 20170904.5294390Hand, foot & mouth disease update (07) - Mexico 20170704.5150139Hand, foot & mouth disease update (06): Thailand 20170701.5144249Hand, foot, & mouth disease update (05): Thailand (SK) 20170623.5125187Hand, foot & mouth disease update (04): Australia (VI) 20170520.5050110Hand, foot & mouth disease update (03): Pakistan (PB), comment 20170316.4905767Hand, foot & mouth disease update (02): Thailand, Viet Nam 20170303.4875744Hand, foot & mouth disease update (01): Southeast Asia, UK, USA, Domin.
