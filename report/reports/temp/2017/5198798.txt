One India [edited]<http://www.oneindia.com/india/21-people-fall-ill-after-consuming-tea-in-ups-mirzapur-2502901.html>Around 21 people fell ill on [Sun 23 Jul 2017], after consuming tea at a tea stall in Uttar Pradesh's Mirzapur district. However, following the incident, the victims were referred to Varanasi Trauma Centre. Suspecting a case of food poisoning, police have collected food samples that will be sent for examination. It may be recalled that around 27 people had fallen ill after consuming contaminated tea last week [week of 17 Jul 2017]. The locals had gathered at a tea stall on the Shaktinagar-Varanasi road on the occasion of Guru Purnima to have tea. ""Soon, most of those who had consumed the tea started vomiting. They were immediately rushed to Ahraura primary health centre. One of them has been referred to Varanasi for treatment,"" District Magistrate Vimal Kumar Dubey said. By evening, all of them were discharged from the health centre.[Byline: Madhuri Adnal]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The incubation period is not stated specifically here but appears to be quite short.A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than 1 hour) suggests that the etiology was heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes include a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc, vomiting, and diarrhea for tin, and blue or green vomitus for copper. - Mod.LLMaps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/17737>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
