Detroit Free Press [edited]<http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/04/18/livingston-measles-brighton-restaurant/100606832/>Livingston County Health Department officials are warning [residents] they may have been exposed to measles.The warning follows a confirmed case of measles in a Livingston County resident. It affects anyone who was at [specific locations listed in URL above]. ""This is not a matter of food safety or restaurant sanitation,"" Chelsea Moxlow, health promotion coordinator said in a press release [Mon 17 Apr 2017]. ""The individual with measles was a customer of the restaurant while contagious.""""Both facilities are working with LCHD to help notify employees and members of the public about the potential exposure to measles,"" she added.Measles is ""highly infectious disease,"" Livingston County Medical Director Dr Don Lawrenchuk said. ""You don't even have to be in the same room with someone to get the infection,"" he said. ""There have been cases where someone sick with measles was in a doctor waiting room and someone sat in the same waiting room that was never vaccinated and came down with the disease by breathing the same air from 2 hours before.""The Livingston County resident was exposed to the measles while traveling on the same airplane as an unrelated child who was not vaccinated and returning from a country where many measles cases were reported. Health officials did not say which country.Anyone who was at the restaurants or the Brighton hospital during the given times is asked to monitor themselves for 21 days - or until [Tue 25 Apr2017] - for rash with fever or other symptoms consistent with measles, which is a highly-contagious, airborne disease. The illness starts with a runny nose, red eyes, cough, fever and sore throat and tiny white spots may appear in the mouth. A raised, red rash appears on the 3rd - 5th day of illness and it typically starts on the face and spreads down the body.Health officials said having 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine at least 28 days apart is ""fully protective."" Having one dose of MMR vaccine is about 93 percent protective.The 1st dose is routinely given to children after their 1st birthday. Vaccination is not necessary if an individual has a prior history of measles illness.[Byline: Lisa Roose-Church]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>A Healthmap of the United States may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>******[2] NebraskaDate: Tue 18 Apr 2017Source: The North Platte Telegraph [edited]<http://www.nptelegraph.com/news/local_news/additional-cases-of-measles-suspected-in-the-area/article_5eb5e840-2474-11e7-bbfd-8301753d0cd3.html>As health officials investigate 3 more suspected measles cases in the region, the North Platte Public Schools announced that non-immunized students will be barred from classes and school activities for the next week [week of 23 April 2017].""Students that have a weakened immune system and those who not fully immunized are at the highest risk of contracting measles,"" said Stuart Simpson, executive director of finance, facilities and operations, in a recorded call that went out to parents on [Tue 18 Apr 2017].""Due to state regulations, the North Platte Public School District will be excluding non-immunized students from school and school related activities through [Thu 27 Apr 2017].""The West Central District Health Department confirmed one case of measles over the weekend and said that 3 patients are going through additional tests after coming down with ""measles-like symptoms.""According to the statement issued by the department on [Tue 18 Apr 2017], individuals who visited the locations [listed in the report at the URL above] during the specified time frames may have been exposed to the virus.[Byline: Kamie Stephen]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******Europe[3] Portugal, LisbonDate: Wed 19 Apr 2017 18:54:10Source: Xinhua [edited]<http://www.abc.es/sociedad/abci-sarampion-cobra-lisboa-victima-mortal-joven-17-anos-201704191755_noticia.html>English: <http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-04/19/c_136220950.htm>A 17-year old girl died in Lisbon's Dona Estefania hospital on [Wed 19 Apr 2017] in the early morning after contracting measles amid an outbreak. She had been admitted to the intensive care unit during the weekend with pneumonia, after contracting measles.It is the 1st known death amid an outbreak in Portugal. The Portuguese authorities said earlier this week [week of 16 April 2017] that they had already been notified of 23 cases of measles since the beginning of the year [2017], with 11 cases confirmed and 12 being investigated.The country's director general for health on [Mon 17 Apr 2017] called on parents to vaccinate their children ""without hesitation."" Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, which affects mostly children. The disease is continuing to spend across Europe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The WHO has warned of a ""potential to cause large outbreaks wherever immunization coverage has dropped below the necessary threshold of 95 percent.""The countries with largest measles outbreaks are Romania and Italy, with Romania seeing 3400 cases and 17 deaths since January 2016 and Italy facing a rise in the 1st weeks of 2017 with 238 cases.--Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>ProMED-ESP article title translations - Apr 20--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[4] ItalyDate: Thu 20 Apr 2017Source: News 4 JAX [edited]<http://www.news4jax.com/health/measles-outbreak-surging-in-italy-as-officials-urge-confidence-in-vaccines>An outbreak of measles is spreading across Italy, with more than 1600 cases of the disease reported in 2017, across 19 of the country's 21 regions.The number of cases seen so far this year [2017] is already higher than the total number of cases seen during all of 2016, according to the European Centers for Disease Control.The outbreak adds to concern among European health officials who have been monitoring an ongoing outbreak in Romania, where almost 4800 cases have been reported since the start of 2016. The country has also seen 21 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.""Italy is one of 2 main countries affected across the (European) region at the moment,"" said Dr Robb Butler, Program Manager of the Vaccine-preventable Diseases and Immunization Program of the WHO Regional Office for Europe.The United Stated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now issued recommendations for anyone traveling to Italy to ensure they are vaccinated against measles. Recommendations for travel to Romania have been in place since 2016.The Americas were declared measles-free in 2016, something the European region of WHO is still working towards.Almost 40 percent of cases in Italy were admitted into hospital and the median age of those affected was 27 years, according to the country's Ministry of Health.The European Center for Disease Control state most cases were in patients older than 15 years of age, meaning babies and young children are not the ones becoming infected but instead people who failed to be vaccinated as children.""Italy has had suboptimal coverage for many years now,"" said Butler, adding that vaccine coverage for measles has fallen every year since 2012. The country saw a large outbreak in 2014, when 4350 people were infected.Of the 1603 cases reported this year [2017], as of 16 April, 88 percent are known to be unvaccinated.More than 95 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated for the measles virus not to persist within a population, known as the herd immunity threshold. In 2015, WHO data shows coverage in Italy at 83 percent for those who received a 2nd dose of a measles vaccine. Some regions within Italy are as low as 70 percent, said Butler.Butler believes the fall in confidence towards vaccines is fueled by both a rise in the anti-vaccine movement across Europe as well as complacency towards the disease, with some not receiving vaccinations due to lack of concern about the risk of contracting measles.""Parents are under the impression measles cases have been consigned to history,"" he said. ""Until they see an outbreak.""But he is more worried about the increasing refusal of the vaccine by people fearing adverse effects, which stems as far back as the MMR scare ignited by a now discredited and retracted paper published by UK scientist Andrew Wakefield. ""We have seen vaccine refusal increasing,"" said Butler.""Our advice is clear: everyone should be vaccinated,"" he said.While negative attitudes are also playing a role in Romania's ongoing epidemic, experts add the country's health system, and its inability to reach everyone in the population has an equally crucial part to play in the outbreak. ""Vaccines are in good supply ... but a large percentage of the population is hard to reach,"" said Butler. Officials in Romania, however, are currently reporting temporary supply issues for measles containing vaccines which have slightly stalled their response.There are 630 000 registered Roma in Romania and many more unregistered that are under-served by the system and need particular attention, said Butler.""There's a convergence of these different concerns,"" said Heidi Larson, Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. ""But the main issue is safety anxieties.""In 2016, Larson led a study exploring the state of vaccine confidence across 67 countries worldwide in which people were asked 4 simple questions: whether vaccines were important, safe, effective and compatible with their religious beliefs.""(Italy) was the 2nd worst in the world, 2nd only to France,"" in terms of negativity towards vaccines, said Larson.Approximately 20 percent of those surveyed in Italy (20.6 percent) and Romania (19.8 percent) disagreed with the statement that vaccines were safe. In France, more than 40 percent disagreed, while the global average was 13 percent, said Larson. France has also experienced a measles outbreak this year [2017].""Measles is the 1st thing you will see after non-vaccination, said Larson. ""Because it's so highly infectious.""Larson fears that anti-vaxxers in positions of power will further aid these outbreaks by increasing uncertainty and anxiety among populations and feels that those in support of vaccines now need to be more vocal, like their opposition.""We shouldn't ignore it,"" she said, adding that health professionals and public health officials should have conversations with people and not be dismissive of their concerns.Dr Andrea Ammon, European Centers for Disease Control acting director, said: ""It is worrying to see the accumulation of unvaccinated individuals and as a consequence outbreaks of measles in several European countries, particularly considering the availability of a highly effective and safevaccine against the disease.""Health officials within Italian and Romanian departments of health as well as the WHO and European Centers for Disease Control are working to control the current outbreaks.""Opportunities for the identification of unvaccinated individuals and catch-up vaccination need to be reinforced,"" said Ammon. ""Closing immunization gaps in adolescents and adults who did not receive vaccination in the past, as well as strengthening routine childhood immunization programs, are vital to prevent future outbreaks and ensure adequate levels of protection.""In Romania, large-scale vaccination campaigns are underway to reach those who remain unvaccinated. ""These are driving people towards immunization sites,"" said Butler.In Italy, national vaccination campaigns are not underway but there is national support to increase investment and communication of the importance of getting vaccinated to protect populations. ""They need to reach underperforming regions,"" said Butler.While confident that the increased investment and campaigns in Romania are a step in the right direction to control that country's outbreak, Butler admits controlling the epidemic in Italy is a ""tough job.""""We are in a very vulnerable place,"" added Larson, believing officials must not drop the ball on public confidence. ""If we resist and say this is still fringe, we risk losing.""[Byline: Meera Senthilingam]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A Healthmap of Europe may be found at <http://bit.ly/2l8108P>]******Asia[5] India, Uttar PradeshDate: Thu 20 Apr 2017 01:07 ISTSource: Business Standard [edited]<http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/3-children-die-of-measles-in-up-village-117042000042_1.html>Measles claimed the lives of 3 children in Nairainpur Bhatan village under Kerakat district Uttar Pradesh. northern IndiaCases of measles have been reported from the village and additional medical teams have been rushed there, CMO Ravindra Kumar said.There were some cases of measles and the locals were getting treatment from nearby doctors but 3 children ages 3,3, and 1 died one after the other, the CMO said.Up to 4 others aged between 2 and 5 years were being treated at the Kerakat Community Health Center and all necessary precautions were being taken, he said.A vaccine-preventable disease, measles is caused by a virus from the paramyxovirus family and spreads through air and direct contact.
