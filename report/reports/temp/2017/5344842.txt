L'Express Madagascar [in French, trans. Corr.SB, edited]<http://www.lexpressmada.com/blog/actualites/epidemie-de-peste-quinze-deces-sur-pres-de-cent-malades-suspects/>Nearly 2 months after the onset of the 1st case of plague in this plague season, the listed victims have nearly reached 100. A total of 93 suspected plague patients have been registered between [1 Aug 2017] and [25 Sep 2017] and 5 of them have died, according to the latest report from the Ministry of Public Health, announced at the meeting of daily meeting Ambohidahy yesterday, [Tue 26 Sep 2017].As many as 17 districts are now affected by the epidemic, particularly those of the central highlands. These are, among others, Antananarivo city, Avaradrano, Atsimondrano, Andramasina, Ankazobe, Moramanga, Ankazobe, Ambohidratrimo, Tsiroanomandidy, Miarinarivo, Faratsiho, of Arivonimamo and Maevatanana. The disease is widespread in areas that do not usually have the plague, such as VohÌ©mar and Toamasina, where imported cases were reported at the beginning of September [2017]. It was a person, infected with plague from Ankazobe, who traveled aboard a bush taxi to Toamasina, in late August [2017], which caused the epidemic of pneumonic plague in Toamasina and Antananarivo to VohÌ©mar city. Cases of bubonic plague are reported in other districts.In Antananarivo, 4 patients, suspected of pulmonary plague, are still receiving treatment at the anti-plague hospital in Ambohimiandra (CHAPA), as of [Tue 26 Sep 2017]. Two others have returned home, cured and without risk of infection. The Minister of Health, Professor Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo, says that the epidemic is under control, but new cases appear almost every day, However, there was the death of a girl in Soavimasoandro on [Sun 24 Sep 2017], following a pulmonary suspicion, and there were also patients admitted to CHAPA, last week. Following this, the figure has almost doubled in a few days. Last week, there were still 60 cases confirmed by the Institute Pasteur of Madagascar (IPM).It is only at the beginning of the plague season right now. It may last through April [2018]. Until then, this epidemic may infect hundreds, if serious measures are not taken. Everyone has to make his own, especially in terms of sanitation, to prevent the rise of rats at the village level. Plague is a disease of rats that is transmitted accidentally to man. Pneumonic plague presents with sudden high fever, fatigue, and a blood-streaked cough. The appearance of painful (lymphatic) glands is a distinctive symptom of bubonic plague. If treated on time, the disease presents no danger.[Byline: Miangaly Ralitera]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alertspromed@promedmail.org[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans. It is worrisome that some cases have spread to the east side of the island where plague is not often seen.The last WHO statistics on global plague infections was published in 2016 with data 2010-2015; Bertherata E: Plague around the world, 2010-2015.
