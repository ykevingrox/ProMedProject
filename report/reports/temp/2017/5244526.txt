India [edited]<http://www.india.com/news/agencies/japanese-encephalitis-kills-seven-in-manipur-2392297/>In the past few weeks, 7 persons have died in Manipur due to Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne disease, said T. Kamini, a biologist at the state unit of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme on Thursday [10 Aug 2017]. He said that 83 others are currently undergoing treatment in hospitals.Stressing that steps have been taken to control the outbreak of disease, he said that people have also been advised to sleep inside mosquito nets and take other precautions.There is no facility to test blood samples in Manipur, and so they are sent outside the state.Doctors attending to such patients say that the outbreak is usually high in the rural and hill areas and that some foreigners coming from Myanmar are believed to have carried the disease [JE virus-infected people do not spread the infection, because their viremias are not high enough to infect vector _Culex_ mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on viremic birds or pigs. - Mod.TY].Health Minister L. Jayentakumar said: ""There are reports of outbreaks of these diseases. Doctors and paramedics have been rushed to the affected areas. There is no shortage of medicines to cope with the situation.""Some doctors who refused to go to the interior areas had been suspended, and so they are sent outside the state.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Manipur state was reported on 1 Aug 2017 (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (MN) Bangladesh (RP) 20170801.5216309). That outbreak was reported in the Churachandpur district in southwestern Manipur state, an isolated area difficult to access. It is not clear whether the above report is of cases in that same district or a different one. Nor is it clear whether these cases are laboratory confirmed as JE. Manipur state is within the JE virus endemic area of northeastern India. No mention of non-JE acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is made, suggesting that all of these Manipur cases are JE virus infections.Maps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/311>. - Mod.TY]
