The cases were recorded in the Dadaab Refugee Camp in Garissa County affecting children under 5, who were part of a group of new arrivals from Somalia. The vaccination status of these children and many others who are fleeing conflict and drought in the region is unknown. This has put the health of those in the camp and the host community at risk.Dadaab currently hosts over 250 000 refugees from Somalia and other countries neighbouring Kenya. A total of 12 cases of measles have been reported to date with no deaths recorded. The main risk factor for the outbreak is the new incoming refugees from Somalia. Kenya has recorded a high immunization coverage due to the highly successful national measles and rubella immunization campaign carried out in May 2016, which reached over 20 million children. A risk analysis undertaken by the Kenya Ministry of Health in late April [2017] shows a high routine vaccination coverage of 95 percent in the refugee camp.To respond to the current outbreak, UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Health and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in carrying out an integrated measles vaccination campaign in the camp that also included the Malezi Bora interventions such as deworming, vitamin A supplementation, screening and treatment referrals for cases of malnutrition, and other medical conditions. The campaign targeted all children aged 6-59 months in the camp and new arrivals aged 5-14 years.The immunization campaign concluded on 23 May [2017] was carried out in Hagadera, Ifo, Ifo 2, and Dagahaley camps that are part of the larger Dadaab refugee compound. A total of 61 755 children aged 6-59 months and 184, aged 5-14 years, were successfully vaccinated. In addition to mobilizing resources for this important exercise, UNICEF provided extensive technical support including quality assurance in the transportation and administering of the vaccines, and the provision of advocacy, communication and social mobilization assistance to the Ministry of Health and UNHCR.The Representative of UNICEF in Kenya, Werner Schultink, says, ""We are working hand-in-hand with the Government and other partners to ensure that the measles outbreak is contained and that all children are immunized against the disease. The consequences of measles are very severe and children can die from it. That is why we are now making arrangements to extend the vaccination campaign to the host community, to ensure that all children at risk are covered as a matter of urgency.""An integrated measles mop-up vaccination campaign targeting host community counties neighbouring Dadaab is expected to begin in the coming weeks of June 2017. This will take place in 3 sub-counties in Garissa and 2 in Wajir County. The strategy during the activity will be to immunize all children aged 6-59 months against measles and all under ones to receive all their scheduled vaccinations, to improve the general routine immunization coverage in the host community.UNICEF is working with the Government, UNHCR, WHO, and other partners to continue strengthening the immunization of children in Dadaab, the host community and those coming from Somalia, as well as to establish a coordination mechanism to support effective response to the measles outbreak.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Kenya can be seen at <http://tinyurl.com/kck73tk> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3536>. - Mod.LK]******[2] South Africa (Western Cape)Date: Mon 12 Jun 2017 20:22 SASTSource: SABC News [edited]<http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/f258bf00417c48dc865d872c6b8b577e/W-Cape-Health-department-urges-children-to-vaccinate-for-measles-20170612>The Western Cape [South Africa] Health Department has urged all parents to take their children for a measles vaccination irrespective of their immunisation status.

Department spokesperson Jo-Anne Otto, says parents need to ensure that their children are protected.""What this is, is just a booster shot again. In the February and March [2017] outbreak not all less than 5 year olds went for the vaccination. It was mostly those kids who were at risk, who were living close to the area the outbreak happened.

Cases have been reported from all the country's 41 counties, or judetes.In addition, health officials put the measles death toll at 30. The most deaths have been reported in Timis (8), Dolj (6), and Arad (5).Some previous and ongoing measles outbreaks in other EU/EEA countries have been epidemiologically linked to the current outbreak in Romania.Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected people. Symptoms generally appear in two stages.In the 1st stage, which lasts 2-4 days, the individual may have a runny nose, cough, and a slight fever. Eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light while the fever gradually rises each day, often peaking as high as 103-105 deg F [39.4-40.6 deg C] F. Small bluish white spots surrounded by a reddish area may also appear on the inside of the mouth.The 2nd stage begins on the 3rd to 7th day and consists of a red blotchy rash lasting 5-6 days. The rash usually begins on the face and then spreads downward and outward, reaching the hands and feet. The rash fades in the same order that it appeared, from head to extremities. A person can spread measles from 4 days before the onset of rash through 4 days after the rash begins. Although measles is usually considered a childhood disease, it can be contracted at any age.The single best way to prevent measles is to be vaccinated. Individuals should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine to be protected.[Byline: Robert Herriman]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Romania can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Mod.LK]******Asia---[7] Bhutan, Maldives: elimination, WHODate: Tue 13 Jun 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, WHO report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/bhutan/bhutan-maldives-eliminate-measles>Bhutan, Maldives eliminate measles----------------------------------Bhutan and Maldives have eliminated measles, a highly infectious disease that is a major childhood killer globally. The 2 countries have become the 1st in WHO South-East Asia Region to be verified for having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission, ahead of the 2020 regional target.""Bhutan and Maldives have demonstrated how a highly contagious virus like measles can be eliminated. WHO commends them for this momentous public health achievement,"" Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director of WHO South-East Asia, said, announcing the findings and conclusions of the WHO South-East Asia Regional Verification Commission for Measles Elimination and Rubella control.The Regional Director said, ""The strongest political commitment, alongside the concerted efforts of health workers, officials and partners at all levels, has helped achieve this landmark success, which is a boost to the Region's effort to eliminate measles and control rubella.""Bhutan and Maldives launched their Expanded Program on Immunization in 1979 and 1976 respectively, and since then worked indefatigably to increase access to immunization services.""Both countries achieved and maintained high coverage of measles vaccination, despite geographical challenges. They also established strong laboratory-supported surveillance for measles, and have conducted detailed case investigation and tracking, right up to the very last case,"" Dr Khetrapal Singh said.Maldives has not reported any case of indigenous measles since 2009, and Bhutan since 2012.To fortify their progress, both countries have been carrying out mass vaccination campaigns with measles and rubella vaccine covering high-risk populations.""While endemic measles virus transmission has been interrupted, both Bhutan and Maldives continue to be at risk of measles virus importation. Hence, both countries must continue efforts against measles and rubella and protect high-risk populations to effectively deal with any importations,"" Dr Khetrapal Singh said.Measles elimination and rubella control by 2020 has been one of WHO South-East Asia Region's flagship priority programmes since Dr Khetrapal Singh became Regional Director in February 2014.An estimated 620 000 measles deaths have been averted in 2016 alone following vaccination carried out by Member countries. Nearly 107 million children have been reached with an additional dose of measles vaccine through mass vaccination between 2013 and 2016.All countries have introduced 2 doses of measles containing vaccine and have been making focused efforts and progress against measles and rubella. All countries are conducting case-based surveillance for measles and rubella, and Regional surveillance standards have been revised to meet elimination standards. The measles laboratory network has been expanded from 23 laboratories in 2013 to 39 WHO accredited laboratories in 2016.""To meet the 2020 measles elimination and rubella control goals, all countries need to make greater efforts to increase measles vaccination coverage through childhood immunization programmes, as nearly 4.7 million children remain unvaccinated against measles in the Region annually,"" Dr Khetrapal Singh said.The overarching goal of universal health coverage and the core Sustainable Development Goal theme of leaving no one behind provide new opportunities to further improve immunization programmes, enhance access to new vaccines, and strengthen health systems to sustain the gains made so far, she said.The measles elimination and rubella control strategy in WHO South-East Asia Region is based on four key approaches -- achieving and maintaining at least 95 percent vaccination coverage with 2 doses of measles and rubella vaccine through routine and supplementary immunization; developing and sustaining a sensitive case based surveillance that meets recommended performance indicators; developing and maintaining an accredited measles and rubella laboratory network; and strengthening support and linkages for these strategies.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[At the same time that we see measles cases increasing in incidence in USA and Europe, Bhutan and the Maldives are to be congratulated on achieving measles eradication.Maps of Bhutan can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/bhutan/maps/bhutan-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/154 > and of the Maldives at <http://www.globalcitymap.com/asia/images/maldives-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/143>. - Mod.LK]******USA---[8] MinnesotaDate: Mon 5 Jun 2017Source: Digital Journal [edited]<http://www.digitaljournal.com/life/health/minnesota-measles-cases-jumps-to-73-exposing-over-8-000-to-virus/article/494327>Right now, there are more measles cases in Minnesota than there were in all of the United States in 2016. This was caused by anti-vaxxers spreading a debunked rumor through the state's large Somali-American community that the vaccine causes autism.In early May [2017], Digital Journal reported Minnesota Health Department officials were scrambling to contain a measles outbreak that had mainly affected Somali-American children. At that time, 44 cases of the highly contagious disease had been identified, mostly in Hennepin County.According to The Verge, Kristen Ehresmann, the director of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Prevention, and Control Division at Minnesota's Department of Health said more than 8000 people, mostly in schools and hospitals have been exposed to the virus.Ehresmann pointed out that when fewer people are vaccinated, they put large numbers of the community at risk, particularly those who are too young or sick, adding that ""many of the cases could have been prevented if people had gotten vaccinated.""Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be fatal. Symptoms usually start with a fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. Then a rash develops that usually spreads from the head to the rest of the body. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2 doses of the vaccine are about 97 percent effective in preventing the disease.As Digital Journal noted in May [2017], the upsurge in measles cases was primarily limited to the large Somali-American community -- caused by a concerted effort by anti-vaccine groups showing up at community health meetings and distributing pamphlets claiming the measles vaccine caused autism, an unfounded myth that has been proven to be false.Imams and health officials can work together to stop the outbreak-----------------------------------------------------------------As it turns out, almost half of Somali-American children in Minnesota have not been vaccinated for measles. Adding to concerns -- the holy month of Ramadan has 3 more weeks to go, with numerous gatherings and prayers still to come. Health officials and Muslim religious leaders are facing the challenge of getting through Ramadan without the measles outbreak spreading further.Elham Ashkar, who works on community outreach for Children's Minnesota hospitals and clinics told NPR [National Public Radio] News that ""One of the imams, and I'm paraphrasing, he said, 'If you don't immunize, it's like killing the Muslim children.' I think that's such strong messaging.""Imams, in their position as religious leaders, can spread the word on the dangers of not vaccinating their followers' children. ""They are a person who can take scripture, Islamic principles, and can also relate that back to how people make health decisions,"" said Ashkar.[Byline: Karen Graham]--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>andProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[A similar report in Spanish can be found at <https://www.voanoticias.com/a/mineapolis-minnesota-sarampion-comunidad-somali-estados-unidos/3845931.html>According to <http://tinyurl.com/yaksoabo>, the Minnesota Department of Health now counts the total number of measles cases at 76, of which 64 are in the Somali community. A plan is being put together to reach Somali parents right after Ramadan in July [2017]. Somali health care providers are being recruited, as are parents who have vaccinated their children and other community leaders to talk to parents and their family members. Vaccination with MMR vaccine is extremely important for this community because many Somalis travel to visit relatives in Somalia, and there are widespread measles outbreaks there.The state of Minnesota can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354>.
