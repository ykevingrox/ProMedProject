A case without massive initial proteinuria [the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine] is probably not a HFRS case. In our experience, and particularly that in Finland (the country with the highest HFRS incidence in the world), more than 1/3 cases have presented (but rapidly transient) nephrotic-range proteinuria, meaning more than 3 gr/24 hours protein excretion, or equivalent protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) or albumin/creatinine ration (ACR) in preferably early morning urine samples, if the renal function is compromised.As stated in ProMED-mail archive no. 20131023.2017083: ""In all forms of hantaviral renal participation (including _Andes virus_ (ANDV) and even _Sin Nombre virus_ (SNV)), initial and often heavy proteinuria is far more frequent and outspoken than renal function impairment. Temporary endothelial dysfunction and capillary hyperpermeability resulting in (very) protein-rich fluid loss from the vascular compartment are common to all hantavirus infections (HFRS and HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]), and there is no reason why the renal endothelium should form an exception in American cases. For instance, early proteinuria is present in 100 per cent -- if looked for -- of South American HPS caused by ANDV. ANDV-HPS cases now form the brink of all American HPS cases together. Therefore, it can only be regretted that the WHO, CDC Atlanta, and other official agencies did not simply include proteinuria among their admission criteria for ""HPS"" as the easiest, quickest, and cheapest test for full assessment of this distinctive feature.""Since apparently the old adagio is now finally dismissed, stating that HFRS is absent in the New World (despite the presence of millions of wild -- and pet? -- rats), it is perhaps time to revise the inclusion criteria for hantavirus infections in CDC Atlanta and WHO institutions. Although never exactly defined, the ""renal syndrome"", constituting the salient clinical feature of HFRS, since its official denomination by WHO in 1983, is not only characterised by acute kidney injury (AKI, previously incorrectly denominated as acute renal failure or ARF), but also acute proteinuria, and often microscopic haematuria, all items easy and quick to verify.Transient but definite renal abnormalities cannot longer said to be absent in American HPS cases, if in fact they are too rarely, if ever, examined. It would be interesting to see if acute proteinuria, and acute microscopic haematuria are really absent in North-American HPS cases -- if properly examined for on hospital admission. For the current Illinois and Wisconsin SEOV-induced HFRS cases, such a search would have looked mandatory.--Jan Clement, Veroniek Saegeman, Katrien Lagrou, and Marc Van RanstBelgian Hantavirus Reference CentreLaboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology & Rega Institute for Medical ResearchUniversity of Leuven, U.Z. Gasthuisberg,3000 LeuvenBelgium<jan.clement@uzleuven.be>[Dr Clement and colleagues have again provided timely and helpful comments. One hopes that tests for acute proteinuria and acute microscopic haematuria will be implemented on hospital admission of suspected cases of hantavirus infections in the Americas as Dr Clements and colleagues suggest, to determine the frequency of occurrence in these cases. These low cost, rapid tests are easily implemented.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Illinois and Wisconsin in the Upper Midwest USA can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/216>. - Mod.TY][See Also:Hantavirus - Americas (05): USA (IL,WI) Seoul virus 20170122.47826612014---Hantavirus update - Americas (42): USA (NY) Seoul virus, rat reservoir, comment 20141028.2907225Hantavirus update - Americas (41): USA (NYC) Seoul virus, rat reservoir 20141017.28721562013---Hantavirus update - Americas (39): comment 20131023.2017083Seoul virus - Sweden: pet rat, 1st detection 20130705.1809509].................................................sh/ty/mj/ml"
