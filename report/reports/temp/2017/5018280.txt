Reuters [edited]<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-yemen-security-cholera-idUKKBN1841CU>A cholera outbreak in Yemen killed 25 people this week, the WHO said, as 2 years of war continues to wreak havoc on the impoverished country's health and sanitation system. The deaths from the diarrheal disease which is carried in food and water tainted by human faeces are among 1360 cases that the United Nations agency reported since 27 Apr 2017. Some severe cases can kill within hours unless treated with intravenous fluids and antimicrobials.""(This) is extremely alarming. We are facing a reactivation of the cholera epidemic,"" Nevio Zagaria, the WHO's representative in Yemen, told Reuters. ""The cause is that there is 2 years of war in Yemen. There is a huge impact on the infrastructure, the electricity power is on and off, the water pumping stations are not functioning regularly and this has an impact on the quality of water.""A previous outbreak subsided last winter, Zagaria said, and the country has experienced a total of around 27 000 cases including 130 deaths during the conflict.Yemen's conflict pits the Iran-allied Houthi movement and elements of the military against the Saudi-led military coalition backing the internationally recognised government. Largely stalemated in nationwide battlefronts, the war has plunged millions into poverty, displaced millions of others and killed more than 10 000 people. The UN said a child aged under five dies of preventable causes every 10 minutes in Yemen.[Byline: Noah Browning, Tarek Fahmy]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Cholera - YemenDate: Sun 7 May 2017Source: Medical Xpress [edited]<https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-05-hundreds-cholera-cases-yemen-msf.html>At least 570 suspected cases of cholera have surfaced in war-torn Yemen in the past 3 weeks, sparking fears of a potential epidemic, Doctors Without Borders said [Sun 7 May 2017]. The Shiite Huthi rebels put the number of cases at 1681 in 12 provinces, including in the north and west of the country, according to the Sabanews.net website which cited their health minister, Mohamed bin Hafedh. Healthcare has dramatically deteriorated in Yemen as conflict between the Iran-backed rebels and the Saudi-supported government continues to escalate, leaving hospitals destroyed and millions struggling to find access to food and clean water.The WHO now classifies Yemen as one of the worst humanitarian emergencies in the world alongside Syria, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Iraq. ""We've treated more than 570 cases we suspect may be cholera over the past 3 weeks,"" Doctors Without Borders (MSF) spokesman Ghassan Abou Chaar told AFP [Agence France-Presse].""There are fears that the disease could turn into an epidemic. 2 years into the war, the healthcare system has collapsed, hospitals are destroyed... and government employees' salaries have not been paid,"" Abou Chaar said. He said MSF had seen a marked hike over the past week in suspected cholera cases in 5 provinces across the country.A general strike in the capital Sanaa has also sparked sanitation concerns in the capital, as the streets began to flood with garbage at the weekend [6-7 May 2017].An official with Yemen's health ministry confirmed cholera had reappeared last week in Yemen, with cases reported in 10 provinces across the country.Ministry spokesman Abdelhakim al-Kahlani told AFP 2 cholera-related deaths had been confirmed in Sanaa, 3 in the central Ibb province, and 4 in the western Hodeida province.A cholera and acute watery diarrhea outbreak in 2016 killed 99 people, with 15 658 suspected cases of cholera reported.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Yemen can be seen at <http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Yemen.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[3] Diarrhea - Indonesia (Papua province) fatalitiesDate: Wed 26 Apr 2017 11:40 pm WITSource: The Jakarta Post [edited]<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/04/26/dozens-die-of-diarrhea-in-papuan-villages.html>At least 37 people died in a bout of diarrhea that has struck 4 villages in Awena district in Lanny Jaya regency in Papua since December 2016. 18 people died in Tinggira village, 13 in Eyuni village, 3 who were from Yugimia and 3 residents of Indawa village.There are also 4 people currently being treated in the Tiom regional hospital in Lanny Jaya, the regency secretary Christian Sohilait said on [Wed 26 Apr 2017]. Dirty water consumption was believed to be behind the outbreak.""The water sources in the villages are natural water ponds that had long been used by the villagers. However, the ponds have been contaminated by human and animal waste. The villagers still use it for their household needs without properly boiling the water,"" he said adding that a sample of the water had also been delivered to a laboratory in Jayapura for further research.The Lanny Jaya administration had sent a team of doctors to the 4 villages and distributed medicines. The team would disseminate information about healthy lifestyles, which included distributing pots to locals to promote the boiling of water. The Papuan provincial administration would also prepare reservoirs to channel clean water from wellsprings.[Byline: Nethy Dharma Somba]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[If many of the deaths reported were in adults, the possibility of infection with _V. cholerae_ should be considered. - Mod.LLMaps of Indonesia can be seen at <http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/indonesia_admin_map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/60290>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[4] Diarrhea - Bangladesh-Burma border, refugee childrenDate: Mon 1 May 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, Kaladan Press Network report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/diarrhea-affects-burmese-refugee-camps>Diarrhea, fever and stomach pain are affecting the Rohingya refugee children at Bangladesh-Burma border recently, Zaffar Ullah, a community health worker from the camp said. Many unregistered Rohingya refugee children of Leda (Tal) including registered refugee children of Nayapara camp have been suffering from various diseases since the end of April 2017, Zaffar added.According to refugees, the affected children and elders are being given basic treatment through the IOM [International Organization for Migration] of Leda and Ministry of Health (MOH) of Nayapara official camp. Mostly, refugee children (1 to 7 years) are suffering from these diseases, the refugees added.Dudu Meah, a refugee committee member from Leda camp said, the refugee children and elders are being affected by diarrhea because of scarcity of pure drinking water and the fresh water of dam dried up that is being used by refugees. The Rohingya refugees also have been facing problems from unhygienic conditions at Leda camp, the wastewater drains are jammed, the committee member further said.Similarly, the new arrival Rohingya refugees are suffering from various diseases in Kutupalong makeshift camp, Balukhali camp [Cox's Bazar], and other places who fled to Bangladesh from Burma in military's crackdown in October 2016, Kufayat said from the locality of Kutupalong camp.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of the area can be seen at <http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/refugees-06202012193820.html/Burma-Bangladesh-400.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/33788>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJContaminated water remains the major risk factor for the acquisition of _Vibrio cholerae_. As reported in Africa (currently in the Horn of Africa) periods of flooding and drought increase the risk of outbreaks. As demonstrated in Haiti the introduction of cholera into a country with a destroyed sanitary system and no underlying immunity can cause a major epidemic and likewise in a country such as Yemen besieged by war. In the classical endemic areas such as the Indian subcontinent and other areas in Asia, rainy reasons often accentuate the number of cases. Acute watery diarrhea is often used as an alternative term for cholera, the primary cause of outbreaks of watery diarrhea with fatalities in adults. - Mod.LL]
