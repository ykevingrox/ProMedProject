Gulf News [edited]<http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/oman/congo-fever-kills-three-in-oman-1.1997098>A total of 3 people have died and 6 other treated for Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Oman since the beginning of 2017, the Ministry of Health said. The fever claimed 7 lives in the country last year [2016], according to the Ministry of Health.In 2016, a number of livestock farms were shut down in the North and South Sharqiyah governorates of Oman, to limit the spread of CCHF.Oman's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has taken measures to limit the spread of the virus in farms. According to ministry's new measures only Omani nationals can import livestock for slaughtering purposes. Importing livestock for breeding purposes has been prohibited.Authorities told Gulf News they are monitoring and educating people on how to prevent the spread of the virus. Farmers have been advised to wear gloves and protective clothing while handling livestock.People are also advised to avoid contact with blood or bodily fluids of livestock or humans who show symptoms of the virus. The 1st case of CCHF was reported in Oman in 1996. Those diagnosed with the virus have a 37.5 percent chance of dying and currently there is no vaccine available for the virus.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral human disease with fatality rates up to 30 percent. It is a tick-borne disease described in more than 30 countries in Europe, Asia and Africa [1].The causative agent is the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) that is a member of the genus Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. An additional mode of transmission is direct contact of broken skin or mucous membranes with blood or tissues of infected livestock or CCHF patients [2].Because of the associated high fatality rate, CCHF is considered to be a major public health threat. In addition, the absence of an FDA-approved vaccine, and the potential for human-to-human transmission and nosocomial outbreaks, it is also considered to be a significant public health issue. CCHF is noted to be endemic in the neighboring countries in the Arabian Peninsula for instance, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait [3-4]. CCHF cases were 1st reported in Oman in 1995 [5].The case numbers for 2017 to date mentioned in the above report underline the importance of early diagnosis of suspected patients for proper management and prevention of nosocomial infections.References1.
