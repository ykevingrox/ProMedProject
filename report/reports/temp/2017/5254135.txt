The resident of Escambia county caught the extremely virulent _Vibrio vulnificus_ bacterium, though officials have not said how._V. vulnificus_ is a found in salty, warm water and can enter the body through open wounds or from eating raw or undercooked shellfish.Infections are rare, but often fatal, with around one quarter of those infected dying. Less common, but more deadly, are _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections. These can be fatal about 50 percent of the time, according to the Florida Department of Health. While healthy individuals have little to worry about, those with compromised immune systems and those with kidney or liver disease are 80 times more likely to develop a bloodstream infection.In 2016, 46 people contracted the bacteria in Florida and 10 of them died. In 2015, 45 people contracted the bacteria and 14 of them died. So far in 2017, 14 people have contracted the bacterium, but only one has died.To avoid the infection, the Florida health department warns those with weak immune systems, including those with kidney or liver disease, to be careful around the water and to wear footwear to protect their feet from cuts from shells or rocks on the beach. People with open wounds should stay out of the water and should immediately treat any scratches or cuts they get. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of _V. vulnificus_.""_V. vulnificus_ is often mislabeled as flesh-eating bacteria, but it is very important to note that it is not flesh-eating bacteria,"" said Mara Gambineri, Communications Director with Florida Department of Health. ""_V. vulnificus_ is a naturally occurring bacteria in warm, salty or brackish water, so it is present year round in Florida. ""Florida's beaches and waters are safe to enjoy responsibly if you take proper precautions,"" she said, adding that the bacteria poses no risk to normally healthy people without open wounds or cuts. Good wound care is the best way to prevent a bacterial infection, she advised.""Keep open wounds covered with clean, dry bandages until healed and don't delay first aid of even minor, non-infected wounds like blisters, scrapes or any break in the skin."" She added, ""Raw shellfish can also be contaminated with _V. vulnificus_ so it is important for people to thoroughly cook oysters and other shellfish to avoid getting sick.""The best advice to avoid problems is to not eat raw oysters or raw shellfish, including those that do not open during cooking. ""Boil shucked oysters at least 3 minutes, or fry them in oil at least 10 minutes at 375 deg F [191 deg C],"" advises the department. It's also important to avoid cross contaminating cooked seafood by handling it with utensils or exposing it to juices from raw seafood.[Byline: Matthew Little]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[""Flesh eating disease"", more appropriately called necrotizing fasciitis, can clearly be caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_ although other bacteria including _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus) and mixed bacterial infections can also cause the same limb- and life-threatening infection. Necrotizing fasciitis caused by _V. vulnificus_ primarily occurs in people with underlying diseases but may occur from either direct wound infections or ingestion of undercooked seafood especially oysters.The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5534>.

A report released by the MCHD [Mobile County Health Department] said that the individual was off-shore and not in gulf coastal waters when they received an open wound, while in water containing the bacteria. The species has been identified as _V. parahaemolyticus_.This makes 6 documented cases for 2017 involving Mobile County residents. The 1st case dealt with a Mobile County resident who consumed raw oysters in another state in March 2017. The 2nd incident took place in April 2017, also involving the consumption of raw oysters, but in Mobile County. An investigation confirmed that the oysters in that incident were imported from another state and were not harvested locally. 2 other cases took place during June 2017 and came from wound exposure while in bodies of waters near Dauphin Island, the Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay. The 5th case was reported at the end of July [2017]. Despite intensive research, not enough information was available to pinpoint an exact source for the bacteria, which was identified as _V. cholerae_ non 01, 0139.Of the 1st 4 reports, 2 cases were identified as _V. vulnificus_, while one was _V. parahaemolyticus_ and the other was _V. fluvialis_. According to the Centers of Disease Control & Prevention, about a dozen _Vibrio_ species can cause human illness, known as vibriosis.These bacteria naturally live in certain coastal waters and are present in higher concentrations between May and October when water temperatures are warmer. However, the bacteria can be present throughout the year in some areas. All of the cases involving Mobile County residents have been considered mild, and have not involved the serious bacterial skin infection called necrotizing fasciitis. According to the CDC, most people who get necrotizing fasciitis have other health problems that may lower their body's ability to fight infection.[Byline: Prescotte Stokes III]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Only 2 of these 6 cases were caused by _V. vulnificus_. In general, _V. parahaemolyticus_ and _V. cholerae_ tend to cause gastrointestinal infections but wound infections do occur. The non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ do not produce cholera toxin and do not cause epidemic cholera although in some cases, severe diarrhea may occur. - Mod.LLThe state of Alabama can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8322>.

According to health officials, the 56-year-old, of Jasper County, Texas, experienced a severe infection after consuming the oysters, which were contaminated with a bacterium called _Vibrio_, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports._Vibrio_ is found in coastal waters, especially warmer areas where oysters live. Authorities say the woman's legs and an arm were subsequently amputated in an effort to cure the infection, but it wasn't enough. ""If you get typical food poisoning with vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and you've had raw oysters, you ought to consider this infection,"" said Dr David Winter. ""If you've got those symptoms, you need to get to the emergency room right away and get treated.""Some people only get the food poisoning symptoms with some forms of vibrio gastroenteritis. According to Winter, it's best to eat oysters fried, not raw.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is not stated if the woman had an underlying chronic disease but it is likely that she did and that the organism was _V. vulnificus_.The following is extracted from the ""Bad Bug Book,"" Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at <http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46>:""_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.""Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.""The ""primary septicemia"" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html>).There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. It is not clear that the woman in this post had any well defined risk factors. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave.The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/36784>.
