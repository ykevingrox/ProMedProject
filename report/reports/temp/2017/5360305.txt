Whitecourt Star [edited]<http://www.whitecourtstar.com/2017/10/02/whooping-cough-appearing-in-whitecourt-schools>Multiple cases of whooping cough [pertussis] have been confirmed in Pat Hardy Elementary School, Hilltop High School, and Ecole St Joseph School [in Whitecourt, Alberta]. All 3 schools have notified parents through a letter.""Of course, those students with pertussis are immediately refrained from attending school,"" said Lisa Bakos, communications officer with Northern Gateway Public Schools. She added that regular janitorial duties have been scaled up at Hilltop and Pat Hardy to prevent the spread of the infection. Bakos advised that parents read the letter carefully and that students continue to keep themselves clean. ""Hand washing, of course, is always so important in schools,"" she said.Dr Kathryn Koliaska, a north zone medical officer with Alberta Health Services, said the levels of whooping cough in Alberta fluctuate year to year and that outbreaks in schools are not uncommon. ""There's obviously large groups of kids together in schools,"" Koliaska said.The group most vulnerable to whooping cough is babies, especially during their 1st year of life. Koliaska encouraged parents to immunize their infants and for pregnant women or anyone who spends extended time around newborns to immunize themselves.Whooping cough symptoms include persistent coughing, gagging and vomiting following coughing and spasms of coughing followed by a ""whoop"" sound.However, Koliaska said going to the doctor is the surest way to diagnose whooping cough. ""It's very hard to tell the difference symptom-wise from a common cold,"" Koliaska said. ""Of course, the test takes a couple of days, so it will also be the conversation at your doctor's office.""As of [28 Sep 2017], the north zone has 83 confirmed cases with Alberta having 744 overall.

A spokesperson with Nunavut's Department of Health could not specify the number of cases, but said it was low. The infection is currently confined to Arviat only.Health officials are asking Nunavummiut -- especially the parents of babies and young children -- to take note, given that the infection can spread easily.Adults or children with those symptoms should visit their local health centre right away, health officials said; early diagnosis and treatment of whooping cough are important to making a full recovery.If you've ever considered getting vaccinated against pertussis, now's the time: the GN encourages all Nunavummiut to ask community health care staff about getting a free vaccination. Anyone showing signs of the infections should also stay home from school or the workplace, to prevent the spread of the illness.Nunavut's latest outbreak began in May 2016 in Pond Inlet, when 4 cases of whooping cough were first confirmed. Gradually the infection spread to other community members and other communities in the Baffin region. By the fall of 2016, Nunavut's health department had tracked more than 100 cases of pertussis in 11 communities throughout the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.It wasn't until April 2017 that the health department declared the outbreak over.[Byline: Sarah Rogers]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Nunavut, with a population of almost 36 000 residents, is the northernmost territory of Canada and is Canada's largest in area and the second least populous of its provinces and territories (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut>).

Medical health officer Dr Mark Vooght said he wasn't aware of any cases that resulted in hospitalization, but the illness can be quite serious for young children and those with compromised immune systems. Risks include obstruction of airwaves, sepsis, and serious infection.Vooght said many people only get checked out when they're very sick -- even bed-bound -- and have had whooping cough for a while.

A Tdap booster is suggested for adolescents and adults to protect against whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria. It is recommended that infants receive the DTap immunization at 2, 4 and 6 month. Boosters are recommended at ages 15-18 months and at 4-6 years. Health officials say children should get a single dose of Tdap at 11 to 12 years of age. And they say pregnant women should receive a single dose of Tdap during every pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks.Health officials recommend parents, siblings, and caregivers of infants be immunized against whooping cough with the Tdap vaccine. Families are urged to check with their doctor to see if children are up to date with immunizations.Families without insurance are urged to contact the Department of Public Health and Wellness at 574-6520.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the United States can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.

Riverton Primary principal Cheryl Glendie said she had been in almost daily contact with both the Health Department and the Education Department since the 1st reported case last month [August 2017].""I report every single case to the Health Department every day so that we keep right on top of it,"" she said. Ms Glendie said she had reported the 1st case of whooping cough to SA [South Australia] Health on [7 Aug 2017] with the infection at its worst over a 2-week period.The infection has been sweeping through the school for around a month, but Ms Glendie believed that it was now beginning to wind down. She said that the outbreak had caused quite a disruption to the school. ""It is quite annoying because it has a disruption to the kids' learning programs,"" she said. ""I have certainly spent a lot of time (dealing with the outbreak) and I would rather be dealing with their NAPLAN [National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy] results. ""I would rather be talking about that than whooping cough!""No staff at Riverton Primary have contracted the infection.The virus [pertussis is caused by a bacterium, _Bordetella pertussis_, not a virus] however, has begun to travel into surrounding towns with confirmed cases of Riverton Primary students from Saddleworth and Marrabel contracting whooping cough.Health Minister Jack Snelling urged South Australians to get vaccinated for the infection back in June [2017] as the number of reported cases was rising at an alarming rate. At the time, the state had seen a 50 per cent increase in the number of reported cases compared to 12 months ago as 860 South Australians contracted the disease compared to 571 at the same time last year [2016].
