Archive Number: 20170422.4988082). Laboratory tests have ruled out a hantavirus infection. Fortunately, the individual is now well enough to have been discharged from the hospital.Suspecting a hantavirus infection in this case was not unreasonable, since there have been 9 confirmed cases in the Los Lagos region. Andes hantavirus is endemic in this region, as is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus.Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) can be seen at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg>.Maps of Chile can be seen at <http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7>. - Mod.TY]
