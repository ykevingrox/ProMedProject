A man who claimed to be suffering from the highly contagious Ebola virus caused the evacuation of one of New York City's most populated transportation hubs on Thu [2 Mar 2017]. A section of the Port Authority Bus Station in midtown Manhattan was shut down after a man sitting on a bench said he was showing symptoms of the disease.The man had been sitting in the station for more than 10 hours and had come to New York from Detroit, authorities said.[Byline: Juliana Rose Pignataro][It is a relief he was not infected. - Mod.LK]Research-------28 Feb 2017: Asymptomatic infection and unrecognized Ebola virus disease in Ebola-affected households in Sierra Leone: a cross-sectional study using a new non-invasive assay for antibodies to Ebola virus[Citation. Glynn JR, Bowary H, Johnson S, et al. (28 Feb 2017 EPub). The Lancet Infectious Diseases. <http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30111-1/fulltext>][The frequency of asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus is unclear: previous estimates vary and there is no standard test. Asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus could contribute to population immunity, reducing spread. If people with asymptomatic infection are infectious it could explain re-emergences of Ebola virus disease (EVD) without known contact.[The investigators] validated a new oral fluid anti-glycoprotein IgG capture assay among survivors from Kerry Town Ebola Treatment Center and controls from communities unaffected by EVD in Sierra Leone. [They] then assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies to Ebola virus in a cross-sectional study of household contacts of the survivors. All household members were interviewed. Two reactive tests were required for a positive result, with a 3rd test to resolve any discrepancies....This new highly specific and sensitive assay showed asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus was uncommon despite high exposure. The low prevalence suggests asymptomatic infection contributes little to herd immunity in Ebola, and even if infectious, would account for few transmissions.Conclusion. In conclusion, we have used a non-invasive assay to show that asymptomatic Ebola virus infection occurs, but accounted for only a small proportion of infections, so would have little effect on herd immunity. It is unknown whether those with asymptomatic Ebola virus infection are infectious, or could harbour virus in the long term, like some survivors. In that respect, the low proportion of asymptomatic infections is reassuring because these transmissions would be challenging to prevent. We also identified missed symptomatic cases, some of which were mild. Many questions remain, including why some people escape infection or disease despite high exposure, and whether those asymptomatically infected will have any immunity in future outbreaks.]See Online/Comment Bavari S., Kuhn J.H.

Intriguingly, oral swab-based assays might be used to do new geographically broad serosurveys to confirm or refute previously determined anti-Ebola virus seroprevalences, to identify and study truly asymptomatically infected people, and to better define the ecological niche of Ebola virus.]28 Feb 2017: UAlbany biochemists make breakthrough in Ebola detection<http://www.timesunion.com/tuplus-business/article/UAlbany-biochemists-make-breakthrough-in-Ebola-10967432.php> [At the University at Albany, the assistant chemistry professor has developed a breakthrough process to detect the virus [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] that killed more than 11 000 people in 2014 in West Africa. Using tiny, gold nanoparticles, Mehmet Yigit and UAlbany graduate student Muhit Rana can detect almost instantly whether a patient has the disease, which will then cause a urine or saliva sample to change from purple to red in a matter of minutes. The disease is then confirmed by measuring the amount of light absorbed by the infected sample. The development is cheaper and more efficient than current standards, and could prove crucial for combating Ebola, which can kill an afflicted person within 3 weeks.][The innovative approach these scientists have taken should be fruitful in detection of many other infectious and non-infectious agents. Early detection is key to successful treatment of patients infected with many agents. - Mod.LK]28 Feb 2017: M Waxman et. al.
