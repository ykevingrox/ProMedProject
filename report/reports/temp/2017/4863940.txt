The patient, resident of Pingle county of Guilin city, had history of consuming sick chicken (raised by the patient's own family) before onset of the symptoms. The patient was in critical condition and died afterwards. Guangxi Region has reported 3 human H7N9 AIV cases since 2017.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The case reported from Guangxi had history of ingesting meat from a possibly infected chicken and subsequently got sick. However, as the chicken was one from domestic flock, direct exposure to the infected bird or birds is highly likely to have resulted in transmission.According to available evidence, infected birds can shed a lot of bird flu viruses, for example, in their droppings or their mucus. If someone touches an infected bird or an environment contaminated with virus and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, they may be infected with bird flu virus. There is some evidence that infection may also occur if the flu virus becomes aerosolized in contaminated material, such as when an infected bird flaps its wings. If someone were to breathe in airborne virus, it's possible they could get infected [<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h7n9-faq.htm>]Poultry infected with H7N9 virus do not experience any illness signs or symptoms. H7N9 virus-infected poultry are well-appearing, but transmission to humans can occur. H7N9 virus has been found in birds (poultry) and contaminated environments in China in some of the same areas where human infections have happened. Available evidence suggests that most people have been infected with H7H9 virus after having contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including visiting a live poultry market. Public awareness messages describing high risk practices with domestic poultry can be helpful in this regard. - Mod.UBAA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/355>.]
