Food Safety News [edited]<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/09/raw-milk-cheese-tied-to-listeria-cases-moms-to-be-at-high-risk/#.Wb1OpciGNPY>At least 2 people in Rhode Island have developed infections from _Listeria monocytogenes_, causing public health officials to warn against eating soft cheese referred to as queso fresco.An alert posted Wednesday [13 Sep 2017] by the Rhode Island Department of Health did not include any details about the 2 victims but specifically urged pregnant women to not eat cheese made with unpasteurized milk. Pasteurizing milk kills _Listeria_ and other bacteria that often are present in so-called raw milk.""Queso fresco is a type of soft cheese. Queso fresco, queso blanco, panela, and asadero-style cheeses are only considered safe when they are marked with a professional label stating that they are 'pasteurized' or 'made from pasteurized milk,'"" according to the state warning. ""Homemade queso fresco is sometimes made with unpasteurized, or raw, milk. Unpasteurized milk can cause serious illness.""Pregnant women are significantly more likely than other people to develop serious listeriosis infections when they consume foods or beverages contaminated with even trace amounts of the bacteria. Among pregnant women, the highest rates of [listeriosis] are seen among Hispanic women, according to the Rhode Island health warning. A pregnant woman with listeriosis can pass the infection to her unborn baby. It can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, and impairments in newborns.Anyone who has eaten any soft cheese recently and developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctors about the possible exposure. It can take up to 70 days after exposure to the bacteria for symptoms to develop.Symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In some cases, an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract.In addition to pregnant women, high-risk groups include young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, including cancer patients and transplant recipients.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>[Queso fresco is a soft unaged white cheese that is made by curdling milk and then straining the curds in cheesecloth and pressing. It can be made from either pasteurized or unpasteurized (raw) milk. The US FDA prohibits interstate commerce of fresh, unaged (uncured) cheeses made from unpasteurized milk. These cheeses, however, can be sold within states that permit sales of raw dairy products. Rhode Island is one of the states that do not permit the sale of raw milk (<http://www.realrawmilkfacts.com/raw-milk-regulations/state/rhode-island>). If the queso fresco involved in the Rhode Island outbreak was homemade, the news report above does not say how the households obtained the raw milk in Rhode Island.Because aging/ripening of cheese for at least 60 days is thought to reduce bacterial contamination, the FDA permits interstate commerce of cheese made from raw milk if the cheese is aged (cured) at a temperature of not less than 35 F [1.6 C] for at least 60 days (<http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/02/publishers-platform-60-day-rule-the-facts/#.WMWFxLGZPjA>). However, ageing raw milk cheese for 60 days may not totally ensure safety when _Listeria monocytogenes_ is introduced as a post-processing contaminant (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18724749>). - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/241>.]
