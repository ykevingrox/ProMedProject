We have also reported this to Public Health Wales.""He added: ""Algal blooms of this nature are not uncommon and have been reported at this lake in the past.""In this instance there is nothing to suggest that it poses any significant threat to the wider environment but we will be working with local landowners to see if there are ways to reduce the nutrient input into the lake in the future.""Warnings have been placed around the lake warning people that if certain algae are present, it can cause illness in humans and animals. People have been urged not to swim in the lake, eat fish caught in it, ingest the water or allow pets to swim in the water.[Byline: Owen Evans]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[It seems they are being proactive, posting signs and recommending no swimming, or ingestion of fish or water.Some toxic algae blooms are easily visible, such as a sheen or even in very heavy blooms a thin scum on the top. There are different types of toxic algae, but they all require a certain level of nutrients in the water. Those nutrients may come from run off of gardens, fields, yards or other sources. When the nutrient level in the water drops, the algae start to die. Another is when it rains, it dilutes the nutrients.Facts about cyanobacteria:- the algae occur naturally but can increase rapidly during warmer months;- if the water is cloudy, discolored, or has small globules suspended in it, avoid all contact;- not all cyanobacterial blooms are visible to the naked eye, and toxins can persist after the blooms disappear;- cyanobacterial concentrations can change quickly with changing environmental conditions (such as wind). A health warning is in place; contact with the water should be avoided.The main effects of blue-green algae blooms are deterioration of water quality and production of toxins by some species. Exposure to algal toxins has been linked to fatalities of livestock, wildlife and pets.Toxic algae can cause liver failure, and death. Please head the warning and do not swim or drink the water and do not allow your pets swimming or drinking privileges. - Mod.TGMaps of Wales can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/wales/map/wales-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59800>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
