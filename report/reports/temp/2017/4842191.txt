Apparently, all these cases continue to result from the sylvan (jungle or forest) cycle of transmission without spillover into an urban cycle with transmission by _Aedes aegypti_, which is abundant in cities and towns in Brazil. Fortunately, supplies of vaccine are reported to be adequate for the campaigns that are underway. Continued vaccination in the affected areas and of those at risk should bring this outbreak to an end in people, but the outbreak in monkeys may continue.ProMED-mail subscribers interested in reading the Brazil Ministry of Health update cited in the above report can access it (in Portuguese) at <http://portalarquivos.saude.gov.br/images/pdf/2017/fevereiro/20/COES-FEBRE-AMARELA-INFORME16.pdf>.
