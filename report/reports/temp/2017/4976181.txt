She was first admitted to a local hospital (Dolakha Samudaya Hospital), but did not improve with antibiotics, [and] thus referred to STIDH with [suspected] scrub typhus infection.Serological testing for scrub typhus, dengue, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and typhoid fever were found negative; however, common tick-borne diseases, could not be ascertained due to lack of testing resources.She is being treated with doxycycline and is showing a gradual improvement. On [Sun 16 Apr 2017], she was discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of tick bite fever.Little is known about tick-borne diseases in Nepal, and hence, more research is needed to understand exactly how rural communities in particular, are being affected by tick-borne diseases in Nepal, as happened in this case.--Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research Unit Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital Kathmandu, Nepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Pun for his continued contributions.This patient from Nepal presented with an eschar at the site of a tick bite and a history of high fever, chills, and severe joint and muscle pain following the tick bite. Serology for scrub typhus was negative. From personal communication and a picture submitted by Dr. Pun the tick was a hard-bodied variety.Tick/mite-borne diseases include those caused by: - _Rickettsia_ species: _Rickettsia rickettsii_ (Rocky Mountain spotted fever); _R. parkeri_ (spotted fever); _R. philipii_ (Pacific Coast tick fever); _R. akari_ (rickettsialpox)- _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (scrub typhus)- _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ (ehrlichiosis) - _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (anaplasmosis)- _Borrelia_ species: _Borrelia burgdorferi_, _B. mayonii_, B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_ (Lyme disease); _B. hermsii_, _B. parkeri_, and _B. turicatae_ (relapsing fever)- _Francisella tularensis_ (tularemia) - _Coxiella burnetii_ (Q fever)- _Babesia microti_ (babesiosis) - Various viruses (Colorado tick fever virus, Bourbon virus, Heartland virus, Powassan encephalitis virus).In addition, in the US and Europe, _Borrelia miyamotoi_, transmitted by hard-bodied ticks, causes a relapsing fever-like illness (high fever, chills, marked headache, myalgia and arthralgia with elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26053877>). Central nervous system involvement has been described in 2 immunocompromised patients.Although high fever (such as, 104.5 deg F/40.3 deg C) and eschar is wrong for Lyme borreliosis, eschars are present in some rickettsial spotted fevers (Australian, African, and Mediterranean spotted fevers), Pacific Coast tick fever, rickettsialpox, and _R. parkeri_ relapsing fever (_R. parkeri_ is transmitted by soft-bodied ticks), and some borrelial diseases. For example, a French traveler was reported to have developed on returning home from Ethiopia an eschar and radiculopathy, caused by a _Borrelia_ spp., transmitted by a tick suspected to be hard-bodied  (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776391>).Dolakha, with a population of about 200 000 residents, located in the northern portion of the Central Region, is 1 of the 75 districts of Nepal (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolakha_District>).
