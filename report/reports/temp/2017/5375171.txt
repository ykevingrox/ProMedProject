On 13 Sep [2017], 6 cases of chikungunya [fever] were reported in the capital city of Rome, Lazio.As of [4 Oct 2017], Italy has reported 239 chikungunya cases in the Lazio region (146 confirmed and 93 probable) and 6 confirmed autochthonous cases among 55 reported cases in the city of Guardavalle Marina, Calabria region. Several probable and confirmed cases were reported in other regions of Italy (that is, Emilia-Romagna, Marche) and other EU Member States (France and Germany). All were epidemiologically linked to Anzio, Rome or Guardavalle Marina. This brings the number of reported cases in Italy to 298 cases.The Lazio region has an estimated 5.8 million inhabitants, with 4.3 million in the Metropolitan City of Rome, 125 000 inhabitants in Latina and 55 000 in Anzio. Guardavalle Marina is a town of less than 5 000 inhabitants, 660 km south of Rome.The virus circulating in Anzio, Italy, belongs to the East/Central/South African (ECSA) lineage and shows on a limited analysed amplicon fragment (507 bp, sequence available in GenBank) 100 percent homology with 2 strains from Pakistan and India from 2016. The isolated virus does not carry the E1-A226V mutation which is known to facilitate the transmission by _Aedes albopictus_, as reported in the Indian Ocean in 2005-2006. Sequencing of the strain circulating in Calabria is ongoing.On [11 Aug 2017], France reported through EWRS an outbreak of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the city of Cannet-des-Maures, Var department, southern France. As of [3 Oct 2017], France has reported 17 cases (13 confirmed, 3 probable and one suspected) distributed in 2 clusters: 11 cases in Cannet-des-Maures (8 confirmed, 2 probable and one suspected), with date of onset between 28 Jul and 30 Aug [2017], and 6 cases in Taradeau 5 confirmed and one probable), with date of onset between 26 Aug and 9 Sep [2017]. Cannet-des-Maures and Taradeau are 10 kilometres apart, and the 2 clusters are considered epidemiologically linked. The virus circulating in France is different from the one identified in the Lazio region in Italy. It belongs to an ECSA sub-lineage that includes isolates from the Central African region (such as Gabon, Republic of Congo) and carries an adaptive E1-A226V mutation [29].Conclusions and options for response------------------------------------Italy is currently experiencing 4 clusters of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the cities of Anzio, Latina, and Rome in the Lazio region, and the city of Guardavalle Marina in the Calabria region. Autochthonous transmission of mosquito-borne infections is not unexpected in areas where _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes are established and at a time when environmental conditions are favouring mosquito abundance and activity. This is the 2nd time that Italy is facing an outbreak of autochthonous chikungunya, following an outbreak in the Emilia-Romagna region in 2007 [see Chikungunya - Italy (Emilia Romagna) (08) 20071210.3980]. Within the European Union, apart from Italy, only France reported outbreaks of autochthonous cases in the past, that is, in 2010, 2014 and 2017.Autochthonous chikungunya transmission is estimated to have started in Anzio in early-mid-June 2017 or earlier. Subsequently, autochthonous transmission was detected in Rome and Latina, and more recently in Guardavalle Marina. The likelihood of further spread within Italy is still moderate, with suitable but less favourable conditions for vector activity in the coming weeks. In the areas already affected, it is likely that more cases will be identified in the near future.Environmental conditions for mosquito breeding and activity in Europe are expected to become less favourable in the coming weeks. Therefore, there is only a low likelihood that the virus will be introduced to other EU countries with present and active _A. albopictus_ populations and lead to subsequent local transmission.Early detection of imported chikungunya cases at the start of the season of high mosquito activity is critical to prevent establishment of local transmission if the virus was introduced by a viraemic traveller to an area where _A. albopictus_ is established. This relies on increased awareness among clinicians and travellers returning from areas with chikungunya transmission, combined with adequate laboratory capacity.The detection of an autochthonous case should trigger epidemiological and entomological investigations to assess the potential of onward transmission and guide vector control measures aimed at lowering mosquito population density. Member States should consider reporting all confirmed cases of chikungunya who travelled to Italy in the 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms to the Italian health authorities in order to help identify possible additional transmission foci.In addition to coordinated vector surveillance and vector control activities, community sensitisation around transmission foci is important. It is important to inform people of the need for personal protection measures against mosquito bites and to engage local communities in the elimination of mosquito breeding sites. Personal protective measures to reduce the risk of mosquito bites include the use of mosquito repellent in accordance with the instructions on the product label, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers - especially during the daytime when _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes are most active -- sleeping and resting in screened or air- conditioned rooms, and using mosquito nets for beds.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Transmission of chikungunya virus is ongoing, as the confirmed and suspected and confirmed case count has increased from 183 to 298 cases. New cases will likely continue to occur as long as warm weather lasts. The European Early Warning Response System is in place and is important for notifying neighboring countries to be on the alert for cases.Maps of Italy can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_admin_06.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100>.]
