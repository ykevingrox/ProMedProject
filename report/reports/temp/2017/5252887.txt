Since [16 Mar 2017], 10 cases of invasive GAS infection with genotype emm74 have been reported in this population. 3 cases have died. 2 additional invasive GAS cases with the same sociodemographic profile are awaiting genotype results.Cases include 9 males and 1 female, ranging in age from 35 to 72 years (average 54 years, median 52 years). The majority of cases arose in the south-central area of the city [Montreal]. Information obtained during the investigation indicates that all cases accessed one or several community resources for homeless individuals in the month prior to falling ill, such as shelters or day centres. Clinical presentation of cases consists primarily of soft tissue GAS infections (5/10) and bacteremia without primary infection site identified (3/10). Cases are considered severe because of soft tissue necrosis (2/10), toxic shock (5/10), or death (3/10).In the past 5 years, the GAS genotype emm74 had not been identified in Montreal but was identified in a GAS outbreak in a homeless shelter in Toronto in 2016 (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal 20170406.4952247).The outbreak investigation has led to the implementation of a surveillance system of non-invasive GAS infections in this population. To date, 18 non-invasive GAS cases were reported. Among 11 cases with genotype results, 5 have the genotype emm74 (45 percent). Genotype is pending for the other cases.Homeless populations are at higher risk for GAS infections due to factors including close proximity in shelter settings, limited access to personal hygiene measures, higher rates of infestations (lice, scabies, and bed bugs), and barriers to accessing medical services. Montreal Public Health is collaborating with services for homeless individuals, clinical teams, and community partners to ensure the improvement of health and hygiene measures, the rapid detection of cases, and the clinical management of symptomatic individuals.--NoÌ©mie Savard MDDirection rÌ©gionale de santÌ© publiqueLe Centre intÌ©grÌ© universitaire de santÌ© et de services sociaux (CIUSSS) du Centre-Sud-de-l'Ì le-de-MontrÌ©alMontrÌ©al, QuebecCanada<noemie.savard.ccsmtl@ssss.gouv.qc.ca>[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr NoÌ©mie Savard for this description of an outbreak due to group A streptococci genotype emm74 in homeless people in Quebec.GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (<http://www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html>). Over 200 _emm_ types have been identified.Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), detection of exotoxin-encoding genes, and whole genome sequencing (<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948>, <http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192>, <http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416>, and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911>). Molecular analysis of the isolates aids documenting a common source for an outbreak.An outbreak of invasive GAS disease due genotype emm74 occurred in Toronto recently (see ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal 20170406.4952247). This _emm_ type was detected initially in December 2015 and in temporal association with this outbreak, there has been a substantial increase in invasive GAS infection due to emm74 in the local community. Genotyping by whole genome sequencing established that the Toronto emm74 outbreak strains were highly clonal (ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal 20170406.4952247).It would be important to learn if genotyping by whole genome sequencing has been done on the Quebec outbreak strains to see if they match each other and also if they match the Toronto strains. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/275>.][See Also:Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal 20170406.4952247Streptococcus, group A - Canada: (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, RFI 20170402.49426792014----Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - Canada: (PE) RFI 20140123.22254032012----Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - Canada: (NWT) 20120129.10252252008----Streptococcus, group A, emm-59, fatal - Canada: (ON) 20081011.3219].................................................ml/mj/ml"
