DM Pigott et al. Local, national, and regional viral haemorrhagic fever pandemic potential in Africa: a multistage analysis. The Lancet. 2017. DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32092-5>Background----------Predicting when and where pathogens will emerge is difficult, yet, as shown by the recent Ebola and Zika epidemics, effective and timely responses are key. It is therefore crucial to transition from reactive to proactive responses for these pathogens. To better identify priorities for outbreak mitigation and prevention, we developed a cohesive framework combining disparate methods and data sources, and assessed subnational pandemic potential for 4 viral haemorrhagic fevers in Africa, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever, and Marburg virus disease.Methods-------In this multistage analysis, we quantified 3 stages underlying the potential of widespread viral haemorrhagic fever epidemics. Environmental suitability maps were used to define stage 1, index-case potential, which assesses populations at risk of infection due to spillover from zoonotic hosts or vectors, identifying where index cases could present. Stage 2, outbreak potential, iterates upon an existing framework, the Index for Risk Management, to measure potential for secondary spread in people within specific communities. For stage 3, epidemic potential, we combined local and international scale connectivity assessments with stage 2 to evaluate possible spread of local outbreaks nationally, regionally, and internationally.Findings------We found epidemic potential to vary within Africa, with regions where viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks have previously occurred (e.g., western Africa) and areas currently considered non-endemic (e.g., Cameroon and Ethiopia) both ranking highly. Tracking transitions between stages showed how an index case can escalate into a widespread epidemic in the absence of intervention (e.g., Nigeria and Guinea). Our analysis showed Chad, Somalia, and South Sudan to be highly susceptible to any outbreak at subnational levels.Interpretation--------Our analysis provides a unified assessment of potential epidemic trajectories, with the aim of allowing national and international agencies to pre-emptively evaluate needs and target resources. Within each country, our framework identifies at-risk subnational locations in which to improve surveillance, diagnostic capabilities, and health systems in parallel with the design of policies for optimal responses at each stage. In conjunction with pandemic preparedness activities, assessments such as ours can identify regions where needs and provisions do not align, and thus should be targeted for future strengthening and support.******[2] Vaccines-------------9 Oct 2017 Ebola vaccine trial<https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-10-ebola-vaccine-hailed-success.html>[Experts at St George's, University of London, have reported that an Ebola vaccine is safe for children as well as adults and produces an immune response. The worst Ebola virus disease outbreak in history ended in 2016 after infecting 28 600 people and killing about 11 300 worldwide.The outbreak led to urgent action by medical experts across the world to combat this devastating disease; including the setting up of trials of vaccines to stop the disease taking hold.This global commitment to develop a vaccine against the disease suggested that 8 options, out of a starting pool of 15 candidates, should be evaluated in clinical trials worldwide by the end of 2015.Professor Sanjeev Krishna, of St George's University of London's Institute for Infection and Immunity, said: ""An unprecedented Ebola outbreak showed how it is possible for academics, non-governmental organisations, industry and funders to work effectively together very quickly in times of medical crisis. The results of the trial show how a vaccine could best be used to tackle this terrible disease effectively.We need a system of specialists, medical experts and organisers that maintains vigilance against outbreak diseases like Ebola.We should continue to improve ways to make, evaluate and deliver vaccines when they are needed, often in parts of the world lacking in infrastructure for diagnosing infections and providing treatments.""He explained that considering the persistent replication of the vaccine, which is called rVSV-[delta]GP-ZEBOV, in children and adolescents, further studies investigating lower doses in this population are warranted.The vaccine contains a non-infectious portion of a gene from the Zaire Ebola virus. The St George's researchers worked with colleagues on a vaccine trial in Gabon.In addition, lower vaccine doses should be considered when boosting individuals with pre-existing antibodies to Ebolavirus glycoprotein, a finding that has emerged after the vaccine was tested in a country that has experienced Ebola virus outbreaks in the past.The vaccine was 1 of 2 being examined as a 'candidate' option by the World Health Organisation to identify urgently a vaccine to combat the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa.The clinical trial was led by colleagues at University of Tubingen in Germany, coordinated by Professor Peter Kremsner with their partner institute CERMEL in Lambarene, Gabon.Professor Krishna was among a consortium of experts called VEBCON convened by the WHO in August 2014 in Geneva to discuss solutions and strategies for combatting the EVD crisis. He acted as a scientific advisor to the new studies in Gabon. ...-more][More information: ""Safety and immunogenicity of rVSV[delta]G-ZEBOVGP Ebola vaccine in adults and children in Lambareanea, Gabon: A phase I randomised trial,"" PLOS Medicine (2017) doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002402]11 Oct 2017: Liberia trial finds Ebola vaccines yield year-long immune response<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/10/liberia-trial-finds-ebola-vaccines-yield-year-long-immune-response>[A trial at the end of Liberia's [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] outbreak of 2 candidate vaccines that were furthest along in development at the time showed both posed no major safety concerns and triggered immune responses that lasted at least a year, researchers from a US-Liberian clinical research partnership reported today [11 Oct 2017].Liberia was the 1st of the 3 hard-hit countries to become free of the disease. But in October 2014, the country's health ministry had asked US health officials for investigational tools to help curb the outbreak, which led to the formation of Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL).Scientists launched the trial in February 2015 hoping to do a phase 3 study, but they had to scale back to a phase 2 trial because of a steep fall in disease activity that made it impossible to gauge the effectiveness of the vaccines with a phase 3 trial.The team -- reporting its findings in the New England Journal of Medicine [SB Kennedy et al. Phase 2 Placebo-Controlled Trial of 2 Vaccines to Prevent Ebola in Liberia. The New England Journal of Medicine. <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1614067?query=featured_home>] -- compared an adenovirus-based vaccine (ChAd3) developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and GlaxoSmithKline and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine (VSV-EBOV) developed by researchers in Canada and now licensed by Merck with a placebo saline injection.A ring vaccination trial of VSV-EBOV conducted in Guinea in the spring and summer of 2015 had already shown that VSV-EBOV was highly effective in people who received it soon after exposure. And, when used as part of the same strategy, the vaccine has been shown to tamp down small Ebola flare-ups that occurred at the tail end of West Africa's Ebola outbreak.Good antibody response at 1-year mark------------------------------------------The trial, which was sponsored by NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), involved 1500 adults who had no history of Ebola and received one of the vaccines or placebo. Researchers examined participants' blood samples before vaccination and at 4 intervals afterward: 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year.At the 1-week mark, antibody responses were modest for both vaccines. But by 1 month, 71% of those who received ChAd3 and 84 percent of those who got VSV-EBOV developed antibody titers that were 4 times higher than baseline levels or higher. For comparison, only 3 percent of the placebo group showed such an antibody response.By 1 year, both vaccine groups maintained most of their antibody responses: 64% of the ChAd3 group and 80 percent of VSV-EBOV recipients. Of the placebo group, 7 percent still had an antibody response at 1 year.Some of the participants who received one of the 2 candidate vaccines had mild to moderate side effects that resolved, including headache, muscle pain, feverishness, and fatigue. The patterns were similar to what research teams had seen in earlier phase 1 studies for both vaccines.The researchers didn't identify any major safety concerns. Most of the serious medical events that surfaced in the trial were due to malaria. Joint pain incidence didn't vary among the 3 Liberian groups, and the team found none of the arthritis that had been reported in some recipients of VSV-EBOV in an earlier trial in Geneva.Unexpected findings, study limitations-------------------------------------The investigators also found some surprises during the study. In baseline blood tests, they found that 4% already had some Ebola antibodies, hinting at past Ebola infection, but with no known clinical illness.Also, they found that, 1 year after vaccination, malaria levels were lower in people who had received one of the 2 candidate vaccines, especially those who got VSV-EBOV. The researchers wrote that more studies are needed to see whether the finding is due to chance or whether the vaccine might offer cross-reactive immunity.The team highlighted some limitations of the study, including that the trial did not include children. ""The demonstration of safety and efficacy of these vaccines in children is a priority, since 16 percent of the persons with EVD [Ebola virus disease] in the current epidemic were children."" ...-more][Byline: Lisa Schnirring]******[3] Funding: vaccines and antivirals------------2 Oct 2017: Ebola Vaccines, Drugs Added to U.S. Stockpile<https://ohsonline.com/articles/2017/10/02/ebola-treatments-added-to-stockpile.aspx?admgarea=news>[""Today we are prepared to add 4 Ebola countermeasures to the stockpile, whereas 3 years ago, very few products were even in early stages of development,"" BARDA Director Rick Bright, Ph.D., said.

The base period of the contract, with a value of USD 6.96 million, will support a proof-of-concept (POC) study in non-human primates (NHP) and preparations for manufacture under Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) of a vaccine designed to protect against Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, and Lassa viruses. The contract also includes USD 15.29 million in options that may be exercised by the NIAID to support GMP manufacture and clinical evaluation of the multi-component vaccine. The vaccine is being developed in lyophilized form to allow distribution without a cold chain and enable routine mass immunization. Ebola and Marburg viruses belong to the filovirus family of viruses, which cause periodic outbreaks of a highly contagious and lethal human infectious disease marked by a hemorrhagic fever, with a mortality rate that ranges between 25% and 90%. The infection typically affects multiple organs in the body and is often accompanied by severe bleeding (hemorrhage). The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. Lassa virus is endemic to West Africa, where it infects up to 300 000 individuals per year, resulting in 60 000 cases of severe multisystem disease and 5000 deaths. Among those who survive, about 1 in 8 suffer permanent deafness. The main reservoir of this virus is the multi-mammate rat, which lives in close proximity to humans and sheds the virus in its urine and feces.]9 Oct 2017: GSK warns drug firms need more cash to prepare for next Ebola-scale epidemic<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/10/09/gsk-warns-drug-firms-need-cash-prepare-next-ebola-scale-epidemic/>[Britain's biggest drug maker, GSK, has warned world governments that they are not spending enough to prepare for future epidemics on the scale of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] or zika [ZIKAV].The FTSE 100 firm's chief medical officer for vaccines, Thomas Breuer, said the company had built a brand new lab outside Washington DC with capacity to work on vaccines for potential global outbreaks but was lacking public funds to press ahead.Mr Breuer said: ""We have created a completely new site in the US in Rockville near Washington, DC, and we have reserved space in case we get grants to do research on these diseases.We have to run a business so these new initiatives on potential vaccine candidates for future pandemics can only materialise if we get the funds.""In the wake of the Ebola and Zika epidemics -- with the former claiming more than 11 000 lives, mainly in Africa, while the latter resulted in babies being born with congenital brain abnormalities in affected countries -- there has been a coordinated response.Mr Breuer said Cepi's launch was a welcome attempt to ""at least to try to get ahead of the curve"" but had to be backed with sufficient funding. ...-more][Compiled by: Celeste Whitlow < whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Multiple Ebola vaccine candidates are in various stages of development.
