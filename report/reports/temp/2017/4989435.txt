Geo TV [edited]<http://www.geo.tv/latest/139128-Another-case-of-Congo-virus-detected-in-Balochistan>A new case of Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus] has been confirmed in Kohlu area of Balochistan, local hospital sources said on [Sun 23 Apr 2017].A patient suspected of suffering from the Congo virus was admitted to Fatima Jinnah hospital 3 days ago. The patient remains under treatment at the hospital and has been declared to be out of danger, the sources said.This is the 2nd case of the Congo virus reported in Balochistan during the ongoing month [April 2017]. At least 30 cases of the virus were detected in the province during 2016.Health experts urge people to be wary of symptoms like headache, vomiting, red eyes, bleeding, and severe body pain. They advise that anybody suffering from these symptoms rush to a nearby hospital because early diagnosis can save lives.Congo virus [is carried by several domestic and wild animals and transmitted by ticks to both animals and humans].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[""Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a potentially fatal tick-borne zoonosis characterized by hemorrhage, with a fatality rate of between 10 to 50 percent. The causative organism, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, and genus _Nairovirus_ and is the world's most prevalent tick-borne virus. The tick which is the focal point for the transmission of CCHFV belongs to the genus Hyalomma. The environmental conditions in Pakistan are optimal for the replication of ticks, and this further increases the chances of spread of CCHFV infection.""The CCHF virus is transmitted to humans through tick bites or by direct contact with infected animal blood often via farmers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians and so forth. In addition, person-to-person transmission can then occur due to direct or indirect contact with the skin, mucous membranes, or body fluids of infected patients.""Tick bites serve as the major mode of transmission of disease; however, the blood, body fluids and tissues of susceptible animals might also pose a threat for humans. The disease is essentially asymptomatic in animals and poses a threat to people from across the population. For instance, healthcare professionals who deal with patients infected with CCHFV are at a high risk of infection due to inadequate biosafety policies and practices and a lack of proper management procedures as a result.""(<https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-017-0726-4>)The potential high risk groups of CCHF are recognized not only by their professional or work roles but also geographically. The prevalence of CCHF is highest in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and cases have been reported from southern Punjab and Sindh.Generally the case numbers of CCHF go up in the country from May onwards, due to a multitude of causes, including warmer climates, increased tick activity, increase in human and animal movements etc.With these baseline conditions, sporadic cases have been already reported from Punjab and now Balochistan. There is need for coordinated action by both human and livestock/animal health sectors. The risk of CCHF transmission must be assessed and appropriate control measures instituted for slaughtering of animals, use of proper personal protective equipment/clothing, and providing public educational messages for the prevention and control of CCHF. - Mod.UBAMaps of Pakistan can be seen at <http://pakistanmap.facts.co/pakistanmapof/PakistanAdministrativeMap.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59960>.
