ADN Southeast [edited]<http://adnsureste.info/detectan-8-casos-de-hepatitis-a-en-san-mateo-del-mar-region-afectada-por-terremotos-1545-h/>The Health Services of Oaxaca (SSO) reported that according to the Unified Information System of Epidemiological Surveillance (SUIVE), 8 cases of hepatitis A were reported in San Mateo del Mar. It is a region affected by the earthquakes of 7, 19 and 23 Sep 2017.According to the agency, they were given timely treatment and follow-up of the diagnosis, so they do not represent an epidemiological emergency. It is indicated through a communiquÌ© that operative personnel carried out intensive actions in this municipality, where an epidemiological fence was established with domiciliary visits to rule out outbreaks of disease in the population.A brigade was deployed to strengthen strategies, with special emphasis on sanitary regulation and close monitoring of the levels of water chlorination in wells of the neighboring towns and homes in the municipality of San Mateo del Mar through personnel of the Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks (Cofepris).SSO staff reported that the 1st case was recorded in August 2017 and the last on 27 Sep 2017. They do not report on the others. The patients are recovering.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Certainly, earthquakes as disrupters of the sanitary capacity of affected areas can predispose a population to increased enterically transmitted infections, as best reflected by the disastrous cholera epidemic in Haiti.The effects are mostly in the wake of the earthquake and, as in Haiti, can persist for years but also can develop later by disruption of the area's water supplies:Nigro G, Bottone G, Maiorani D, Trombatore F, Falasca S, Bruno G: Pediatric epidemic of _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium in the area of L'Aquila, Italy, Four years after a catastrophic earthquake. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016 May 6;13(5). pii: E475. doi: 10.3390/ijerph13050475.Abstract------""A _Salmonella enterica_ epidemic occurred in children of the area of L'Aquila (Central Italy, Abruzzo region) between June 2013 and October 2014, 4 years after the catastrophic earthquake of 6 Apr 2009.""Clinical and laboratory data were collected from hospitalized and ambulatory children. Routine investigations for Salmonella infection were carried out on numerous alimentary matrices of animal origin and sampling sources for drinking water of the L'Aquila district, including pickup points of the 2 main aqueducts.""_Salmonella_ infection occurred in 155 children (83 females: 53%), aged 1 to 15 years (mean 2.10). Of these, 44 children (28.4%) were hospitalized because of severe dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and fever resistant to oral antipyretic and antibiotic drugs. Three children (1.9%) were re-infected within 4 months after primary infection by the same Salmonella strain. Four children (2.6%), aged one to 2 years, were co-infected by rotavirus. A 7-year old child had a concomitant right hip joint arthritis. The isolated strains, as confirmed in about the half of cases or probable/possible in the remaining ones, were identified as _S. enterica_ serovar Typhimurium [4,5:i:-], monophasic variant. Aterno river, bordering the L'Aquila district, was recognized as the main responsible source for the contamination of local crops and vegetables derived from polluted crops.""The high rate of hospitalized children underlines the emergence of a highly pathogenic _S. enterica_ strain probably subsequent to the contamination of the spring water sources after geological changes occurred during the catastrophic earthquake.""The state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico was part of the area affected by earthquakes in mid-September 2017.
