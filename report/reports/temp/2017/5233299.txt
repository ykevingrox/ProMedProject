Here we report on several outbreak responses with which we were involved both in verification and remediation.In November 2016, a suspected outbreak of anthrax was reported in the Selela ward of Monduli district, located in the northeastern part of Arusha region, Tanzania, affecting both wildlife and livestock. The BBR group was part of a response team including wildlife veterinarians, ecologists, and microbiologists, along with technical staff and competent authorities from various government and non-governmental organizations, including representatives of health ministries that performed a thorough investigation on this outbreak. The response team recorded mortality of 109 wildebeest, 21 gazelles, and 1 hare from observed carcasses, and 10 cattle, 26 goats, and 3 sheep reported by community members to have died. Livestock carcasses were not directly observed because they had been consumed by the owners, and the investigating team found that wildlife carcasses had also been butchered for human consumption. Additionally, the team found that skins from the affected livestock and butchered wildlife were being used as bedding, and tails of the wildebeest were being used as fly swats.Blood and tissues samples collected from the wild animal carcasses confirmed the presence of _B. anthracis_ in smears, as well as by real-time PCR analyses for the presence of capsule and toxin genes. Additional analyses confirmed the presence of nucleic acid signatures of virulent _B. anthracis_ spores in soil samples that were collected near the sites of the animal carcasses. There were also several verified reports of human cases being admitted to the health centers with skin lesions associated with contact and consumption of dead animals.On 20 May 2017 the team received reports of suspected cases of anthrax causing wildlife deaths in the West Kilimanjaro area of Hai district. The team responded and were able to collect samples from tissue, ticks, and soil with body fluids from 2 zebra (_Equus quagga_; [common zebra]) that had died in the last 2-3 days, and also soil from the decomposition patch of an elephant (_Loxodonta africana_; [African bush elephant]) that had died in February [2017]. Additional reports indicated that at least 2 waterbuck (_Kobus ellipsiprymnus_) had died from unknown causes in the past 2 months, but the exact causes of death and geographical coordinates of these carcasses were not established. Based on previous outbreaks in the area, and observations of the dying animals, anthrax (_B. anthracis_) was suspected as the cause of death. DNA was extracted from the samples using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (cat. no. 12888-100), after which extracted DNA was analyzed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting both pX01 and pX02 plasmids. Anthrax was positively confirmed from soil collected at one of the zebra carcass sites. Additional soil, tick, and tissue samples from both zebra carcass sites were positive for either pX01 or pX02, but not both, and no positives were found at the elephant carcass site.On 13 Jun 2017, the Bushmeat Biosecurity Research Laboratory at NM-AIST also was informed of another potential outbreak in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in which both livestock, especially sheep and goats, and wildlife (elephant) were implicated. The BBR team investigating the outbreak found that the wildlife veterinary unit under the NCA had already burned the elephant carcasses and vegetation in the surrounding area. The BBR lab did however receive tissue, blood, and fluid swab samples from 2 elephants suspected to have died from anthrax that were collected prior to burning the carcasses. The samples were analyzed using the methods above. Results showed that blood and body fluid samples from one of the elephant carcasses were positive for both pX01 and pX02, and therefore considered positive for _B. anthracis_. While surveying the area, the BBR investigating team further found that there have been several anthrax cases involving humans from different locations within the NCA. In each case, the affected individuals had been in direct contact with, or had consumed dead livestock, and the most prominent symptoms observed were skin lesions suggestive of _B. anthracis_ infection. These cases included the deaths of 4 people (a 2- and 7-year-old boy, 51-year-old man, and a 58-year-old woman). The team observed that the children were the most affected likely because young boys and girls and their mothers are responsible for skinning/processing any dead sheep or goat, while adult males are involved primarily in the butchering of dead cattle. Where possible, the team collected samples from the hides of the livestock that died and were consumed, whose owners developed skin lesions. Analyses of these samples for confirmation of _B. anthracis_ is underway.In general, the team observed a strong association with reported cases occurring on intensively grazed areas, near to watering points during extended draught prevailing in the region. This finding was consistent with suggested necessary environmental conditions favorable to anthrax outbreaks including previous history of the disease occurrence, prolonged periods of grazing different animal species on the same locations leading to grazing very close to the soil surface in heavily-degraded areas, particularly near available water.The conditions of prolonged drought in the region associated with overgrazing and atypical migration patterns drives sporadic anthrax cases in livestock and wildlife. Drought further increases food insecurity, increasing the likelihood that both wildlife and livestock carcasses will be butchered for human consumption, while products such as hides may be used over much longer periods, both leading to increased risk of human infections. While there are confirmed cases of anthrax in wildlife, due to the vast areas of wildlife habitat and the decreased likelihood of carcasses being observed before being scavenged, wildlife cases are likely under-reported. Coordinated efforts are underway to minimize the risks associated with future outbreaks, and currently the NCA authority has procured about 22 000 doses of anthrax vaccines for a mass vaccination of livestock.Impact------Anthrax still occurs endemically in most wildlife areas in sub-Saharan Africa, and there have been a number of cases of anthrax in livestock and humans reported on ProMED [see also below] and in the local news since October 2016. Where humans, livestock, and wildlife coexist in northern Tanzania's extensive wildlife interface areas, infections are likely to be experienced by all groups. Furthermore, increasing climate variability and land conversion has led to both increasing overlap of wildlife and livestock on remaining grazing areas, and increasing land degradation of these areas due to intensive grazing, thereby creating ideal conditions for anthrax emergence.Interventions to prevent disease in wild animals begin with minimizing risk factors associated with a particular disease condition and responding to the warning signs that can be learned from previous experiences or from subsequent outbreaks. For example, prolonged droughts or rains are useful predictors of disease occurrence that could guide risk-based surveillance.Steps to reduce zoonotic transmission of anthrax to humans should include:1. Identification and localization of the source of the outbreak.2. Establishment of regular and comprehensive disease surveillance, involving a multi-sector ""one-health"" approach.3. Community education cautioning against consumption of meat and the harvesting of animal products such as skins and tails from wildlife or livestock that have died due to unknown causes.4. Harmonization of Standard Operating Procedures in anthrax surveillance and diagnosis between stakeholders and district diagnostic laboratories, including:- Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI)/University of Glasgow (UK);- Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI);- Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT)- Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM_AIST)- Pennsylvania State University (Penn State)- Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Agency (TVLA)- Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA)- Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA)--Eblate Ernest MjingoTanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI)<eblate.ernest@gmail.com>[Thanks to Eblate for so clearly spelling out their surveillance problems for anthrax in northern Tanzania. With extensive national parks and minimal infrastructure their situation is difficult at best.Having been involved in niche mapping anthrax in 3 continents I believe it can provide guidance as to where anthrax can be occurring out of sight, that is, where to go search next. Over the years we have got the resolution down to 1 sq km, and it is even better when limited to specific genomic strains local to the area of interest (see Mullins JC, Garofolo G, Van Ert M, et al.
