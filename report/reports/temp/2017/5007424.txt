AlMomento.net, Agencia EFE report [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]<http://almomento.net/reportan-al-menos-20-muertes-por-leptospirosis-este-ano-en-r-dominicana/311049>According to data from the country's Ministry of Public Health, at least 20 people have died this year [2017] in the Dominican Republic because of leptospirosis, 13 more than in the same period of 2016.An epidemiological bulletin published today [28 Apr 2017] in the health department's website indicates that between 1 Jan and 1 Apr 2017, 200 cases of this disease were reported in the country, compared to 110 reported during the same period last year [2016].Leptospirosis is an acute bacterial disease that affects both humans and animals. The infection is acquired through contact with stagnant water and soils contaminated with urine from reservoir animals, such as rats and other animals of the canine, porcine, and caprine species. According to the Public Health Department, the main prevention measure is to avoid, as far as possible, exposure to contaminated water and soil.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Leptospirosis in the Dominican Republic has been reported previously in multiple ProMED-mail posts (see archives listed below). In 2006, it was attributed to ""sanitary problems and to deficiencies in municipal garbage collection"". Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings.Outbreaks of leptospirosis in the Dominican Republic, as elsewhere, also frequently follow heavy rainfall and ensuing contaminated fresh water flooding. In fact, the Dominican Republic has experienced heavy rainfall and consequent major flooding over the past week (<https://watchers.news/2017/04/27/dominican-republic-flood-april-2017/>). This is the 2nd major flood event in 2 months in the Dominican Republic (<http://floodlist.com/america/dominican-republic-floods-april-2017>).Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals, or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life. Leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic leptospira.Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals -- for example, farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians, dairy farmers, rice and sugarcane field workers, and military personnel. It is a recreational hazard for those who participate in outdoor water sports such as swimming, rowing, or whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and rivers.Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can provide _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) to local laboratories for serological testing of suspected leptospirosis cases in support of the response to a disaster. The DST is suitable for in-the-field testing of suspected patients. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the Dominican Republic can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24>. - Mod.ML]
