PAHO/WHO Zika - Epidemiological Update [edited]<http://www2.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=39706&lang=en>Situation summary in the Americas---------------------------------Since epidemiological week (EW) 44 of 2016, no additional countries or territories of the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus disease. To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector- borne transmission of Zika virus disease since 2015, while 5 countries have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases (Figure 1).Figure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector- borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.1 Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, Brazil, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, CuraÌ¤ao, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Montserrat, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint BarthÌ©lemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, the United States of America, the United States Virgin Islands, and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).2 Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.The following is a summary of the epidemiological situation by sub-regions.North AmericaIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported that Florida no longer has any identified areas with active Zika transmission; however, isolated cases of local transmission could continue to be reported. The Texas Department of State Health Services has not reported cases of local transmission during 2017.Meanwhile, Mexico continues to report confirmed cases with a declining trend observed since epidemiological week (EW) 40 of 2016. Since the last epidemiological update, no new states have confirmed local transmission.Central AmericaThe trend of reported cases in Central America continues to decline (Figure 2), with the exception of Guatemala, where there was a slight increase in suspected and confirmed Zika cases between EW 1 and 9 of 2017, similar to what was observed with dengue during the same period in the country.From EW 1 to EW 10 of 2017, in this sub-region, an average of 180 suspected and confirmed cases were reported on a weekly basis.CaribbeanIn Aruba, an upward trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases persists since EW 29 of 2016. In the other countries/territories of this sub region, the decreasing trend of reported cases continues, with a weekly average of 545 cases reported between EW 1 and EW 10 of 2017.South AmericaFollowing a declining trend in reported cases since EW 7 of 2016, starting from EW 1 of 2017, there has been an increasing trend of reported cases in South America mainly due to increases in the number of cases in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru (Figure 3). Between EW 1 and EW 10 of 2017, an average of 1247 suspected and confirmed cases were reported per week in this sub region.In Argentina, between EW 8 and EW 16 of 2017, 3 new provinces, Chaco, Formosa, and Salta, reported local transmission of Zika Including CÌ rdoba and TucumÌÁn, which reported autochthonous vector-borne transmission of Zika in 2016, a total of 5 provinces have reported Zika virus circulation.In Bolivia (Plurinational State of), the increase in cases has been observed since the beginning of 2017, with 71 percent (280) of the cases confirmed in the 1st 12 weeks of 2017 in the department of Beni. In Ecuador, cases increased from EW 5, and 68 percent (401) of cases confirmed in the 1st 15 weeks of 2017 were from the province of Guayas.In Brazil, there was a slight increase in notified Zika cases between EW 1 and EW 9 of 2017, similar to what was observed with chikungunya during the same period in the country.In Peru, the increase is mainly due the ongoing outbreak in the department of Loreto and, from EW 9 of 2017, with the outbreak in the province of Chincha in the department of Ica.Figure 2 [graph].

Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru, EW 25 of 2015 to EW 16 of 2017.Congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infectionTo date, 26 countries and territories in the Americas have reported confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. In EW 15 and EW 17 of 2017, Ecuador and Barbados reported for the 1st time confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. In the last 8 weeks (EW 10 to EW 17 of 2017), Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Martinique, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the United States of America updated their number of cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection.The table with the number of confirmed cases of congenital syndrome is published on a weekly basis on the PAHO/WHO website and is available at: <http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12390&Itemid=4 2090&lang=en>.Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disordersIn EW 17 of 2017, Barbados reported its 1st 5 cases of Guillain-BarrÌ© syndrome (GBS) associated with Zika virus infection.Figure 4 illustrates the trends in Zika and GBS cases. The downward trend in Zika cases in the region of the Americas is accompanied by a similar trend in GBS cases.Figure 4 [graph]. Distribution of suspected and confirmed cases of Zika and GBS by EW.

It will be interesting to see if incidence increases in Central and North America as 2017 goes on. - Mod.TY[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries in the Americas mentioned above and below can be accessed at<http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574>;North America at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>;Central America <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455>;Caribbean <http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/> andSouth America at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186>. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52913>.]
