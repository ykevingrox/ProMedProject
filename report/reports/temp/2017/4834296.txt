The number of cases was unavailable.[Byline: Travis Williams]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The virus that causes chicken pox tends to replicate well in cold climates, overcrowded areas, in populations with decreased immunity, and among people who are malnourished. The best way to contain it is to isolate the patient.The disease may take a serious form in adults, who may take longer to heal and even suffer from the occasional complication.There is a very effective vaccine. Before U.S. vaccination began, chickenpox caused more than 100 deaths every year; chickenpox caused more than 10 000 hospitalizations every year; more than 4 million people got chickenpox every year.Since U.S. vaccination began (after 15 years of vaccination):- 90% decrease in deaths, meaning fewer than 20 people die from chickenpox every year- 84% fewer hospitalizations, meaning fewer than 1700 people are hospitalized for chickenpox every year- 92% fewer cases means fewer than 350 000 people get chickenpox every yearTwo doses of vaccine are needed to protect against chickenpox.[Figures available at URL: (<https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/vaccine-infographic.html>) showing a decline in the number of deaths per year from more than 120 in 1994 to fewer than 20 in 2010, while vaccination rates increased from around 10% in 1996, the year that the U.S. vaccination program began, to 90% in 2010.]A HealthMap showing the location of Virginia, United States can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/247>. - Mod.LK******[2] India (Hyderabad)Date: Sun 12 Feb 2017Source: New Indian Express [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/feb/12/incidence-rises-with-change-in-weather-1569840.html>With the offset of winter, spread of swine flu cases are expected to subside, but more worryingly, it is during this transition phase between winter and summer that chickenpox is more prevalent. An average of 6 cases are reported in a week at Fever Hospital, Nallakunta. However, with increase in temperatures, the number of cases would come down, say doctors.Superintendent of Fever Hospital Dr K Shankar said that if a person who had not taken the vaccine in childhood opts for prophylactic medicines to avoid the disease, there will be side effects such as nausea.""If a person contracts chickenpox, they should be isolated, as it spreads through contact. Towels, soaps, should not be shared, but food and washrooms can be,"" said Dr Shankar.The 1st dose of vaccine is given to children when they are 2 years old.The disease is caused by Varicella-Zoster virus. Symptoms include lesions on skin, fever and cold. Its incidence comes down as temperatures increase,"" said Dr T Chitralekha, civil surgeon RMO, Fever Hospital.She added that pregnant women, children, and those who have low immunity should be careful. ""Generally, the disease used to be reported in children. However, nowadays, even adolescents get admitted,"" Dr Shankar said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Complications from chicken pox can affect many organs, from the gut, lungs, eyes, kidneys and even the brain. The systemic involvement of the lung is quite common. Between 30% and 40% of adult patients require admission to the hospital. The infection is treatable with antivirals in the early stages to shorten the duration of the infection and to help reduce the risk of complications. - Mod.LKA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/995>.]
