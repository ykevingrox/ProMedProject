Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/tonga-reports-11-typhoid-cases-since-january-11200/>The Tonga Ministry of Health has reported 11 typhoid cases since January 2017, including 5 cases from the village of Veitongo, according to a Radio New Zealand report today [Wed 12 Apr 2017]. This has prompted health officials to temporarily ban kava drinking in public halls in an effort to get the outbreak under control. In addition, the health ministry also imposed a month long ban on making food for public gatherings such as funerals.The news comes as Auckland, New Zealand battles a typhoid outbreak that as of today [Wed 12 Apr 2017] has sickened 20 and killed one.Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium _Salmonella_ Typhi, is a life-threatening bacterial infection. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21 million people annually. _S._ Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry the bacterium. Both ill persons and carriers shed the bacterium in their feces.You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding _S._ Typhi or if sewage contaminated with _S._ Typhi bacteria gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is commoner in areas of the world where hands are washed less frequently and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage.Typhoid fever can be successfully treated with appropriate antimicrobials, and persons given such therapy usually begin to feel better within 2 to 3 days. Dr Sinclair says good basic handwashing is one of the best means of protecting yourself.--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly [both liver and spleen enlarged]. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions (""rose spots"") are about 2 cm [0.78 inches] in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louseborne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3>.]
