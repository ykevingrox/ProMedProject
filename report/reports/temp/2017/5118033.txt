Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/20/c_136380448.htm>""Since the beginning of this outbreak, 166 976 suspected cases and 1146 deaths have been reported from 20 of the country's 23 governorates,"" WHO said on its website on 20 Jun 2017. Earlier in June 2017, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) expected suspected cases could hit 130 000 in 2 weeks, while in May 2017, WHO expected they could reach 300 000 in the next 6 months. The outbreak has spread fast in 20 out of 23 Yemeni governorates in just 7 weeks, since 27 Apr 2017.Yemen is facing total collapse as the war continues. 2/3 of the total population, around 19 million, need humanitarian and protection aid. About 10.3 million people are close to famine and 14.5 million lack access to safe drinking water. Less than 45 percent of the country's hospitals are operational at the moment, but even the operational ones are coping with huge challenges, on top of which is the lack of medications, medical equipment and staffs.The blockade on Yemen, part of a Saudi-led bombing campaign launched in March 2015, has deepened the crisis in the country which used to import most of its basic needs.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Tue 20 Jun 2017Source: UN Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) News [edited]<http://www.irinnews.org/news/2017/06/20/exclusive-largest-ever-stock-cholera-vaccine-headed-yemen>One million doses of an emergency oral cholera vaccine from a global stockpile has been approved for urgent use in Yemen, IRIN has learnt. It is the largest quantity ever deployed at once and is intended to help combat a deadly outbreak sweeping across the war-torn country.At the latest count, there were 167 000 cases and 1146 deaths in Yemen, equating to a death every hour by the _Vibrio cholera_ bacterium, which causes severe dehydration and diarrhea. In just 2 months, Yemen's death toll from the outbreak already accounts for 1.2 percent of the global average of estimated annual deaths from cholera. ""The speed of the spread of the disease is unprecedented,"" Dr Nevio Zagaria, the World Health Organization's representative in Yemen, told IRIN.The International Coordinating Group [ICG], a body established in 2013 to manage to the global stockpile of emergency cholera vaccines, made the decision to deploy the vaccine in Yemen last week [week of 12 Jun 2017], although no official announcement has yet been made. Zagaria's team submitted the request to the ICG for access to the stockpile, and he said the 1st doses are expected to arrive on the ground early in July 2017. ""We are discussing with health authorities the targeting and planning of the campaign tentatively for the 1st days of July [2017],"" he added.International health officials say the emergency vaccinations are necessary to contain the burgeoning epidemic in Yemen, which, after over 2 years of war, is suffering an acute lack of infrastructure to deal with diseases like cholera. ""As the conflict continues, it continuously erodes the existing basic social services. It has affected the healthcare, water and sanitation systems, which have been damaged or run out of fuel to operate,"" explained Bismarck Swangin, a UNICEF spokesman based in the capital, Sana'a.Less than half of Yemen's health facilities remain operational. The rest have been bombed and destroyed, and those hospitals still standing face dire shortages in power, supplies, and staff.[Byline: Naomi Stewart]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 53202 Jun / 73 700 / 60504 Jun / 86 400 / 67605 Jun / 91 400 / 72806 Jun / 96 000 / 74607 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 86912 Jun / 124 002 / 92314 Jun / 140 116 / 98916 Jun / 151 000 / 105419 Jun / 166 976 / 1146To be consistent with past posts, the date is the day prior to the specific posting but, as this one, may not reflect the data point day. In about 7 weeks, almost 140 000 cases and 1000 deaths have been reported with no clear sign of the numbers slowing down.Aggressive interventions to stem this substantial outbreak in Yemen including sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign are problematic because of the ongoing conflict in the country. An intervention with vaccine, if possible, could potentially stem the tide of the ongoing event.The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.""The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).References----------57.
