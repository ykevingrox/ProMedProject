They normally share their forest habitat with noisy howler monkeys that eat their food and appear to get on their nerves, but the hippies are now in flux. A yellow fever epidemic just wiped out thousands of howlers, leaving the hippies as the only thriving primates in the forest.Karen Strier, a University of Wisconsin-Madison anthropologist, just visited the forest, which lies within the federally protected RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala reserve near the Brazilian city of Caratinga. ""It was just silence, the emptiness,"" she remarked to Seeker. ""It was like the energy was sucked out of the universe.""Strier, who is also an associate conservation scientist with the Global Wildlife Conservation, explained that howlers, like humans, are vulnerable to yellow fever. The viral illness results in acute flu-like symptoms, and is spread by mosquito bites. The present epidemic began in December last year [2016]. A few days ago, a man in the state of Rio de Janeiro died after contracting the virus, bringing the human death toll of this latest outbreak to 137. At least 424 other people have come down with the disease, which continues to spread throughout the region. Nearly a thousand additional cases remain under investigation.Health departments in Brazil are rushing to vaccinate as many people as possible -- but the howlers and hippie monkeys cannot be vaccinated.[Byline: Jen Viegas]--Communicated by:ProMED-MBDS from HealthMap Alerts<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[The current expansion of yellow fever in South America, besides a public health problem, also raises concern about potential conservation problems for susceptible non-human primate species in the continent. Not all primate species are equally susceptible to yellow fever virus infection. Old world non-human primates are generally tolerant of infection, whereas New World monkeys (Ceboidea) appear to be more susceptible. However, some species are more affected than others. Of the New World primates, howler (_Alouatta_ spp.) and spider (_Ateles_ spp.) monkeys are the most susceptible species. It has long been known that for these species, infection with yellow fever virus is almost always fatal.The northern muriqui (_Brachyteles hypoxanthus_) is an endangered muriqui species endemic to Brazil. It is unusual among primates in that it shows egalitarian social relationships. It is found in the Atlantic Forest region of the Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, EspÌ rito Santo, Minas Gerais and Bahia. For a picture go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_muriqui#/media/File:Brachyteles_hypoxanthus.jpg>. - Mod.PMB][The primate conservation concerns related to this yellow fever (YF) outbreak expressed by Mod.PMB are on target. As indicated in comments in a previous post and above the greatest risk for adverse population effects is the muriqui monkey, Brazil's largest primate and one of the planet's 25 most-endangered species of primates. There are 2 species of muriqui monkey in Brazil: the northern muriqui (_Brachyteles hypoxanthus_) that has been on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Critically Endangered list for more than 25 years, and the southern muriqui (_Brachyteles arachnoides_), which has been placed on that list more recently. The previous report indicates that brown howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) and masked titis (_Callicebus personatus_) are the non-human primates most affected in this YF outbreak. However, the buffy-headed marmoset (_Callithrix flaviceps_) is also mentioned. It is a rare species of marmoset endemic to the rainforests of south-eastern Brazil and occurs in southern EspÌ rito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro, and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais, the very areas where yellow fever is occurring. Unfortunately, there is no feasible way to halt YF virus transmission among these non-human primates. One hopes that enough individuals will survive for the species to recover.Images of the masked titis can be accessed at <http://www.birdholidays.co.uk/BRAZIL%20pix/2013%20SE%20Brazil/DSC04826%20Masked%20Titi%20Monkey.JPG>.
