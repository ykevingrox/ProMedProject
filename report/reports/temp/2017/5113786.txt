The Korea Times [edited]<http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2017/06/119_231447.html>The Gangwon provincial government said on Saturday [17 Jun 2017] that a woman in Inje County died from a tick-borne virus last week. The woman, 61, who tested positive for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), died while receiving hospital treatment on Wednesday [14 Jun 2017].This is the 1st death from SFTS in Gangwon province this year [2017]. The woman was among 2 people who tested positive for the virus in Gangwon, along with a person in Hwacheon County.The woman suffered symptoms such as a stomachache after working outdoors on her farm and removing and killing an insect on her dog on 11 Jun [2017]. A dead tick was found on her right arm as well as 2 sores which were suspected to be tick bites. The woman tested positive to SFTS on 12 Jun [2017].This is the 3rd death from SFTS nationwide following 2 on Jeju Island. In April [2017], a 64-year-old woman on Jeju Island who engaged in bee keeping tested positive to SFTS and died while receiving hospital treatment. Another woman, 79, died in Jeju after testing positive to SFTS in March [2017]. The woman lost consciousness after collecting wild herbs outdoors.SFTS infections usually occur during the spring, summer, and autumn months when people engage in outdoor activities. A high fever, vomiting and diarrhea after outdoor activity are suspected symptoms of an SFTS infection.Disease control authorities advise wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, as well as wearing hats when engaging in activities in forests or on grass, and using mats when sitting on the ground. In addition, authorities advise taking a shower and brushing off one's clothing and putting it in the wash after outdoor activity.[Byline: Kim Bo-eun]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@peomedmai.org>[SFTS virus is endemic in South Korea, and cases sporadically occur there.In a 21 Jun 2014 comment, Dr Oh Myeong-don, an infectious disease and internal medicine physician at Seoul National University Hospital said: ""The tick that carries the virus in question, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago. A lot of research has been conducted into the issue in China. The reason the media were reporting that the mortality rate of the disease was 30 percent is that at 1st, they were only able to find the most serious cases. But now, reports have also been made of people who recovered on their own after being infected and people who only had mild symptoms, which has brought the mortality rate down to 6 per cent,"" Oh said. ""While there is no reason to be overly concerned about the disease, it is still a good idea to make sure you don't get bitten by ticks."" (See ProMED archive Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (02): (HN) clarification 20140622.2558325).""The SFTS virus is widespread in China in both the human population and domestic animals (especially goats) harboring ticks.""SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described 1st by Yu XJ et al in a publication in the N Engl J Med. 2011 Apr 21;364(16):1523-32, entitled ""Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China"" (<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095>).Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick can be seen at <http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm>.Maps of South Korea can be accessed at <http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/korea-south-admin-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195>. - Mod.TY]
