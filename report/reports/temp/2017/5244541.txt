Cases have risen to 16 since June 2017. And with the new school term just a few weeks away, Public Health Wales is urging parents to make sure their children have had 2 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine before classes begin again.Consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales Dr Rhianwen Stiff said: ""In our current outbreak, we have seen measles pass between pupils at the same school. With children returning from holidays in Europe, and with our ongoing outbreak in Newport and Torfaen, we are concerned that the start of the new term could lead to further cases of measles in Wales. Measles is highly contagious and passes very easily between people who are unvaccinated. The message is simple, MMR offers the best and only protection against measles. If you, or your child, are not up to date with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, speak to your GP surgery immediately.""Parents are also being urged not to take children who appear to have measles to hospital or a GP surgery without calling ahead 1st.A vaccination programme in schools across Newport was launched following the 1st outbreak, with 1089 children receiving immunisation.Adults born after 1970 who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine are also being urged to contact their GP to arrange immunisation, especially if they work with children.The 1st dose of the vaccine is usually given to babies between 12 and 13 months, and the 2nd at around 3 years, 4 months. But it can be given at any time.The cases are being directly linked to a larger outbreak in Europe, which has affected 14 000 people, 35 of whom have died, since the start of the year [2017].--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Wales, United Kingdom may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/281>. - Mod.LK]
