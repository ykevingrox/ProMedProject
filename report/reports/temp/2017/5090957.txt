People engaged with the meat processing were infected with anthrax, said Livestock Officer Md Kamruzzaman.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Sirajganj is to the immediate north of Pabna; see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirajganj_District>.Clearly, the anthrax season has started in Rajshahi. Considering the repetitiveness of these events, a provincial anthrax control and surveillance programme is overdue and necessary on public health, social, and agricultural priorities. The Sterne anthrax vaccine is certainly one of the cheapest vaccines in the world and very effective. The benefit cost ratio for such a progamme would be very positive and cost effective, and would have widespread rural support and in the smaller market towns; contaminated meat routinely finds its way into street markets. The only way to prevent human anthrax in such non-industrial environments is to vaccinate the livestock, and especially cattle. Once a year in the spring is all you need to do. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/153>.]
