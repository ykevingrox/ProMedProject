She had been taking amoxicillin for a dental infection. She was evaluated on 6 Jun 2017 for 4 days of fever, myalgia, anorexia, and diarrhea. Because of suspected colitis she was advised to discontinue amoxicillin; she declined hospital admission. Two days later, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath and confusion. Chest radiography revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia and an effusion. This was treated with cefepime and intravenous doxycycline. On 8 Jun 2017, her stool tested positive for _Clostridium difficile_ toxin A/B by polymerase chain reaction, requiring treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin. Her condition deteriorated, and she died on 11 Jun 2017. Tularemia was not suspected as cause of illness until 17 Jun 2017 when a blood culture collected on 6 Jun 2017 was confirmed as _F. tularensis_, a Tier 1 select agent; no laboratory exposures occurred.The patient lived in a semirural area of northern Arizona, did not engage in outdoor activities, and had no known history of insect bites, exposure to animal carcasses or untreated water. She traveled to Hawaii 16-26 May 2016, returning about 11 days before illness onset. Postmortem exam revealed no bites, abscesses, or lymphadenopathy.The patient's dog was noted to be lethargic and anorexic in late May 2016, 3 days after being found with a rabbit carcass in its mouth. The patient and dog had frequent close contact. Serum from the dog, obtained about 3 weeks after its illness and the patient's death, had a _F. tularensis_-specific titer of 1:256. An assessment of the property on 23 Jun 2017 revealed numerous rabbits and one squirrel carcass with _F. tularensis_ DNA detected in its liver and spleen. Genotyping of _F. tularensis_ from squirrel and human samples showed both infections were attributable to an A.II strain.About 125 human tularemia cases are reported in the USA annually. Humans are infected through arthropod bites, contact with infectious tissues, inhalation, or ingestion (1). Symptoms commonly begin 3-5 days after exposure and can include fever, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, difficulty breathing, and diarrhea (1). 2 _F. tularensis_ subspecies, _tularensis_ (Type A) and _holarctica_ (Type B), cause human tularemia (1,2). Distinct clades within Type A (A.I and A.II) are associated with different virulence in humans and laboratory animals (2,3). A.II strains are localized to the western USA and associated with milder illness than are A.I strains (2,3).Based on the patient's respiratory symptoms, radiographic findings, and lack of alternative exposure history, exposure likely occurred at her property through inhalation of _F. tularensis_, potentially via close contact with her dog. The dog might have transmitted infectious material through oral secretions after mouthing an infected carcass or brought infectious material on its fur into contact with the patient. Human illness linked to dogs has been documented (3).The role of pulmonary sarcoidosis in this patient's illness is unclear, but it might have contributed to the severe outcome of infection with an A.II strain (4). Concurrent infection with _C. difficile_ might also have exacerbated the clinical course of tularemia. Diagnosis of tularemia is challenging because symptoms are nonspecific and exposure history is often unclear. Thorough ascertainment of animal exposures, including nature of contact, might refine clinical suspicion for specific zoonoses. Preventing exposure and implementing early, appropriate therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality. Additional information is available at <https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia>.References----------1.

Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (""stadium"") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).The infection does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another Category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted._F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _Francisella tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1).
