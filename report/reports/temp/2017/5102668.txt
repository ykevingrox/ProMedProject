Metro Public Health Department officials say at least 2 new scabies cases were reported [Mon 12 Jun 2017] morning at the men's facility run by private contractor CoreCivic.All male inmates at the Harding Place facility will be treated for scabies as a precaution. A Metro Public Health Department official told News 2 [Mon 12 Jun 2017] night the outbreak is under investigation.The news comes after at least 39 inmates were infected by scabies rashes at the women's facility. Last month [May 2017], the outbreak also spread to the Justice A.A. Birch general sessions court building in downtown Nashville. An unknown number of infected inmates were transferred to court hearings, where the parasites spread to courthouse employees, lawyers, and members of the general public.As a result, a Nashville attorney has filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). Attorney Gary Blackburn has filed the lawsuit and will seek class action certification. He says at least 40 people were infected by scabies because of the courthouse outbreak, including family members of people who work at the courthouse.In addition to damages for pain and suffering and lost wages, Blackburn is also seeking punitive damages for his clients. ""When this happens, it's highly contagious. So people have to be quarantined,"" Blackburn said. ""One of my clients missed his daughter's rehearsal dinner because of it. It can cause you to miss time from work.""[Byline: Nick Caloway]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Outbreaks of this magnitude are highly unusual. Strict hygiene with daily change of clothes, bed linen and daily showers will reduce the burden of scabies mites. There are 2 treatment options, permethrin containing cream and ivermectin tablets. In the present outbreak it would probably be much easier to use ivermectin, thus ensuring better compliance. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/244>.]
