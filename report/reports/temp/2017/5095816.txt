El Nacional [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/sociedad/reportaron-fallecidos-por-fiebre-hemorragica_18622>Venezuela hemorrhagic fever [VHF] continues endemic in the country and extends is geographic range. The Ministry of Health informed the Panamerican Health Organization on 15 April 2017 that in 2016, 142 suspected cases of this disease were reported, 126 of which were in Barinas state, and of these cases 21 died. Only 7 cases were confirmed. Also in Portuguesa [state] 16 patients were reported, of which 5 died. Of these, only 3 cases were confirmed [as VHF]This information was issued by the We Defend Epidemiology Network and explained that this fever, which appeared for the 1st time in 1989, with a total of 5 epidemic outbreaks, is caused by direct contact or via the respiratory route with cane rat excreta. The symptoms are high fever, muscle pain, sore throat, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting and cough. On the 7th or 8th day, hemorrhagic complications appear followed by multiple organ failure and occasionally, convulsions.The outbreak last year [2016] is the 2nd most severe for incidence of cases, following that which occurred in 2002, and it is expected that 2017 will have another epidemic.The areas most affected by this disease, which occurs exclusively in Venezuela, until now have been in Portuguesa state in the municipalities of Guanarito, PapelÌ n and San Genaro. In Barinas, just in Sosa municipality and western GuÌÁrico. It has spread to other municipalities in Barinas since 2015, and for the 1st time the greatest incidence in this place than in Portuguesa state.'This situation could be explained by seasonal variation in rodent populations in the affected areas and greater exposure of inhabitants in rural areas to rodent habitat, due to increase in lands for agricultural use,"" the Network stated in an announcement.There is no vaccination or treatment for this fever, just vital support to maintain the patient.On [30 Jan 2016] the Venezuelan Society of Public Health and the Network issued the 1st bulletin announcing the outbreak, that was 1st known from local communication in Barinas and that was confused with DHF. In a short time young adults, a child, a pregnant woman, and an elderly person died, 5 of whom were members of the same family.On this past 15 April [2017], the Ministry informed the Pan American Health Organization about the 142 cases of this disease in 2016[Byline: Isayen Herrera]--Communicated by:Kathryn Soderholm<kathryn.soderholm@gmail.com>From ProMED-ESP<promed-esp@promedmail.org>[The causitive agent of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever is Guanarito virus, an arena virus which has _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ (short-tailed cane mouse) and _Sigmodon alstoni_ (Alston's cotton rat) as its natural host. These rodents are widely distributed in the eastern savannas [Llanos Occidentales] in the west of Venezuela. - Mod.JT (in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY)Interestingly, the above report provides some of the requested information about case numbers in 2016 issued in the ProMED-mail post Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever - Venezuela: (BA) susp, RFI 20160210.4007649. VHF has occurred sporadically in Venezuela, with a 40 percent case fatality rate. As Mod.JT mentioned, the rodent reservoirs of Guanarito virus are the Alston's cotton rat _Sigmodon alstoni_ (see image at <http://bit.ly/1Tcct0P>) and the short-tailed cane mouse _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ (see image at <http://bit.ly/1PCnm67>). - Mod.TYReferences (provided in ProMED-mail archive no. 20160210.4007649 by the late Mod.JW):----------1.
