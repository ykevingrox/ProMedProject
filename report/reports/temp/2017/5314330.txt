Dia a Dia [in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<http://www.diaadia.com.pa/el-pais/confirman-otro-caso-de-hantavirus-en-los-santos-324553>The Gorgas Commemorative Institute for Health Studies (ICGES) confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] from the Pintadita in Tonosi, Los Santos province.The affected individual is a 62 year old woman who was hospitalized in the Nelson Collado Hospital in Chitre, Herrera province, and was subsequently released. Tests done by ICGES confirmed the woman's hantavirus disease. Altogether, 17 cases have been registered: 4 in Las Tablas, 1 in Agua Buena de Los Santos and 12 in Tonosi district.[Byline: Zenaida Vasquez]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[With this additional case, the number of cases of hantavirus infections in Los Santos province continues to increase this year (2017), with most coming from the Tonosi region. Although specific dates of hospitalization and release of the affected woman are not given, nor is her clinical condition described, the impression given in his report that her infection was hantavirus fever and had not progressed to the serious hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The situation under which the woman acquired the infection is not mentioned, nor is there an indication if the Ministry of Health or provincial health authorities have, or will, mount an epidemiological investigation in the area where the woman acquired the infection.There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.Maps of Panama can be accessed at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/panama.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55286>. - Mod.TY]
