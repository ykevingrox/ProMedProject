They most often crawl into warm and moist parts of the body, such as the armpit or groin, and their bite can leave a telltale black oval scab up to one centimeter long. Scrub typhus causes a generalized illness in affected people up to 2 weeks after they are bitten, and although easily treated with antibiotics, some people can become seriously ill, or even die, as in the case of one man in the NT [Northern Territory] in the 1990s. The disease cannot be spread from one person to another.""It can often start out as a mild non-specific illness where people might have a fever and headache and feel unwell, sweating a lot, and then over a couple of days can progress because the bacteria can then spread to other organs within the body from the site at which the mite has injected into the person,"" Professor Currie said. ""Because it's a non-specific type of illness initially, unless you're asking questions about travel and where they've been, you might not be thinking about this as one of the infections, and so the medical staff do need to be aware of this so they can do appropriate tests."" Bushwalkers can protect themselves by wearing long pants, using insect repellent, and not sitting on patches of bare dirt or scrub.Litchfield National Park was only opened to the public as a park in 1986, and the 1st scrub typhus case was detected in 1990, even though it is well-known to be established in far-north Queensland, as well as being prevalent across the Asia-Pacific region. ""During the Second World War it actually caused more deaths in Australian soldiers than malaria did in Papua New Guinea,"" Professor Currie said.However, since an initial spate of NT cases, half of which were contracted in the park, the number of diagnoses from Litchfield has dropped off since 2010, which Professor Currie attributes in part to rangers keeping tracks and pathways clear. ""Where the vast majority of people are going, people aren't much exposed to the grassy areas where the mites and rodents are still present,"" he said.Scrub typhus is just one of many tropical diseases in the NT that are not so well known down south, and Professor Currie pointed out that melioidosis was a far greater concern [see appropriate ProMED-mail posts on melioidosis in the Northern Territory, Australia in see also's below]. ""It's way less important than melioidosis,"" he said. He said perspective is important: there has only been one known scrub typhus death in the NT, compared to close to 120 caused by melioidosis, and for the 17 known cases of scrub typhus in the NT since 1990, there have been 1000 reported cases of melioidosis.""Education needs to be ongoing ... We need to have it out there for people who are visiting that there are these things up here which are not seen in the southern parts of Australia,"" Professor Currie said. ""There's people coming and going all the time, and new people and new doctors may not have heard of any of this stuff.""Because it can take up to 2 weeks for symptoms to appear, people may have moved on from the region of infection, and may be misdiagnosed, or there may be a delay in diagnosing them elsewhere, he said. Travellers coming to the NT from northern Queensland and from Asia should also be aware they may have contracted the disease. ""We've had several people come back as returned tourists from many parts of the world but [particularly] South Africa, Timor-Leste, and Thailand, it's a big issue in Thailand,"" he said. ""So returned travellers with fevers, it's not just malaria, it's not just dengue, but scrub typhus is right up there and is important as well.""[Byline: Neda Vanovac]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Scrub typhus is endemic in many regions called the ""tsutsugamushi triangle,"" which extends from Pakistan and Afghanistan in the west to far eastern Russia and Japan in the east to northern Australia in the south (<http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46859-4_17>). Individual cases of locally acquired scrub typhus have also been reported in South America and the Middle East (ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - Chile: (Chiloe Island) western hemisphere 20160910.4478291, <http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1603657> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683066/>).For a further discussion of scrub typhus, please see my moderator comments in the prior ProMED-mail posts - Scrub typhus, snake poisoning - Taiwan: tomb sweeping festival 20160402.4124277 and Undiagnosed illness - India (02): (KA) febrile, children, scrub typhus susp, RFI 20150821.3582448.The Northern Territory (NT) is a federal territory in central northern Australia, located between the states of Western Australia to the west and Queensland to the east, and with a population of 233 300, it is the least populated of Australia's 8 major states and territories (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory>). Indigenous Australian people make up 32.5 percent of the Northern Territory's population. Its capital is Darwin.Litchfield National Park, covering approximately 1500 km2, is 100 km southwest of Darwin, in the Northern Territory of Australia; each year the park attracts over 260 000 visitors (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litchfield_National_Park>).
