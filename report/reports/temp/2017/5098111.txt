In a Twitter post on [Sun 11 Jun 2017], WHO's Yemen office said over 116 700 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in 20 provinces across the country since 27 April 2017.The UN agency earlier warned that the 2-year long fighting in Yemen had destroyed the country's health sector, making it difficult to deal with the epidemic. Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sana'a.In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government.[Byline: Ali Oweida]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The statistics of the impressive ongoing epidemic in Yemen in 2017 are:Date (2017) / Cases / Deaths8 May / 1360 / 2511 May / 2752 / 5113 May / 8595 / 11514 May / 11 000 / 18017 May / 17 200 / 20919 May / 23 500 / 24221 May / 29 300 / 31522 May / 35 217 / 36124 May / 42 207 / 42027 May / 51 832 / 47130 May / 65 300 / 53202 Jun / 73 700 / 60504 Jun / 86 400 / 67605 Jun / 91 400 / 72806 Jun / 96 000 / 74607 Jun / 101 820 / 78910 Jun / 116 700 / 869. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/126>.]
