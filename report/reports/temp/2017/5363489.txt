Isolates from some cases had been laboratory pending for some time. The most recent case, a child from Boukamal with no history of polio vaccination, had onset of paralysis on [5 Aug 2017]. - The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 47. - Poliovirus has been isolated from stool samples collected from a healthy child in Damascus, as part of screening in place for IPDs from Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa. The child, from Boukamal, Deir Ez-Zor, had samples collected on [19 Aug 2017], the day of arrival. WHO and MoH will continue to take samples from healthy children in areas of Damascus with high numbers of IDPs, to ensure there is no wider circulation. - Preparation for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa is ongoing. Newly accessible villages in Thawra district have been included in campaign plans. - A series of meetings between partners to review outbreak response activities to date and to identify priorities for the next 2 months took place in Beirut [29-30 Sep 2017].SummaryNew cVDPV2 cases this week: 7Total number of cVDPV2 cases: 47Infected governorates and districtsGovernorate: District - Number of cVDPV2 cases to dateDeir Ez-Zor: - Mayadeen - 39 - Deir Ez-Zor -1 - Boukamal - 4Raqqa: - Tell Abyad - 1 - Thawra - 1Homs - Tadmour - 1Most recent cases (by date of onset)Deir Ez-Zor governorateLocation: Boukamal districtOnset of paralysis: [5 Aug 2017],age: 30 months,vaccination status: zero OPV/zero IPVRaqqa governorateLocation: Thawra districtOnset of paralysis: [16 Jun 2017],age: 155 months,vaccination status: 6 OPV/2 IPVCharacteristics of the cVDPV2 casesMedian age: 16 months,gender ratio male:female:5:8,vaccination status: - IPV: 9 cases (19 percent) received IPV - OPV: 34 percent zero dose, 45 percent have received one-2 dosesImmunization response - The national response plan currently includes 2 immunization rounds each in Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. Deir Ez-Zor activities include the southern part of Shadadi district in Hasakah governorate. The 1st and 2nd rounds for Deir Ez-Zor have been completed ([22-26 Jul 2017, 22-28 Aug 2017]), as well as the 1st round for Raqqa ([12-17 Aug 2017]).Raqqa - Preparation for the 2nd immunization round for Raqqa is ongoing. Newly accessible villages in Thawra district have been included in campaign plans. - Due to high levels of population movement, WHO has developed a contingency plan to cover an additional 30 000 children not included in campaign micro-plans. An additional 60 vaccination teams are on standby for contingency activities. - Aqua Tabs will be offered to families together with vaccination. - Cold chain has been enhanced in Tell Abyad with the installation of 2 deep freezers and supply of 50 additional vaccine carriers. - Community leaders in Raqqa have been engaged in all districts to assist in the monitoring of vaccination activities and to help facilitate access of vaccination teams.Deir Ez-Zor - IPV vaccination for children missed in the 2nd Deir Ez-Zor round continues through local health centers. IPV is also being administered to IDP children from Deir Ez-Zor in all governorates.Other governorates - IPV campaign activities aiming to reach children aged between 2-23 months in accessible areas of Aleppo and Idlib governorates have started.Regional response - IPV vaccination continues at border points and at UNHCR registration points for unvaccinated children crossing from Syria into Lebanon. Plans are being finalized to administer IPV to children in informal settlements and in high risk sub-districts of Lebanon. - IPV is being provided to travellers without proof of vaccination moving between Turkey and Syria via Bab el Salam and Bab elHawa border crossings. - The bOPV-IPV campaign in Anbar governorate, Iraq, has concluded.Surveillance summary - Poliovirus has been isolated from stool samples collected from a healthy child in Damascus, as part of screening in place for IPDs from Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa. The child, from Boukamal, Deir Ez-Zor, had samples collected on [19 Aug 2017], the day of arrival. WHO and MoH will continue to take samples from healthy children in areas of Damascus with high numbers of IDPs, to ensure there is no wider circulation.Although detection of cVDPV2 in children recently leaving the outbreak affected areas is not unexpected, mitigation measures are in place to prevent further spread of the virus. Routine IPV coverage in Damascus is high, at 82 percent. Two doses of IPV are given to children in Syria as part of the routine immunization schedule. MoH has recently conducted IPV catch-up campaigns in high risk areas to boost immunity levels of vulnerable children. - Of the infected governorates, Raqqa and Homs are currently meeting global standards for AFP surveillance. Deir Ez-Zor governorate meets the primary indicator for surveillance sensitivity, however, has an adequate specimen rate of 76 percent, which is below the minimum accepted standard for this indicator (80 percent). - The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 138 (104 from Mayadeen, 10 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 24 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 16 AFP cases (5 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and one from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 34 AFP cases (17 from Homs city, 14 from Rastan, one from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2] Global update - Global Polio Eradication Initiative - 5 Oct 2017Date: Thu 5 Oct 2017Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/>Poliovirus Weekly Update 04-Oct-2017, World Health Organization---------------------------------------------------------------New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 11Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37New cVDPV cases reported this week: 7Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 56Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5Headlines - Summary of newly-reported viruses this week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017]: Syria: 7 new circulating vaccine derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) cases reported, 5 cases from Mayadeen and one case from Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and one case from Thawra district, Raqqa governorate.

The outbreak primarily involves Deir-al-Zour governorate, but there is now a 2nd case in Raqqah governorate in a 2nd district. Given the time interval from dates of onset to dates of confirmation (most likely due to logistic challenges to collect and transport laboratory specimens), it appears as though there may well be more cases reported in the coming days and weeks (I hope I am wrong with this prediction). - The isolation of the virus in asymptomatic individuals serves to highlight the virus is still circulating in the country, and the isolation of the virus in a refugee entering the capital city of Damascus points out the risks of continued spread in the country.. - While there were no newly confirmed paralytic cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan reported in the past week [week of Sun 24 Sep 2017], the isolation of the WPV in environmental samples serves to highlight that the virus is still circulating in Pakistan.A map showing the global distribution of all WPV1 associated cases and cVDPV associated cases can be found at:<http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.
