IOL (Independent Online), Reuters report [edited]<https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/yellow-fever-kills-at-least-15-in-ivory-coast-73036> A yellow fever outbreak has killed at least 15 people in Ivory Coast and threatens many more in the West African country, the head of a government crisis team said on [Fri 8 Sep 2017].The United Nation's World Health Organisation appealed for funds on [Wed 6 Sep 2017] to help the cash-strapped government in an emergency campaign to vaccinate 3 million people.""Up to now we have had 128 suspected cases of which 20 were confirmed in the laboratory and 15 are dead,"" said Guillaume Loukou Yao, Ivory Coast's health inspector and head of the crisis committee.The mosquito-borne virus thrives in densely populated areas like Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan. Although most recover, victims can suffer jaundice and bleed from eyes, nose, and mouth before kidney failure and death.Yao told Reuters that as well as the vaccination campaign, teams would also be sent out to clean up the drainage ditches and other places where the mosquitoes that transmit the virus breed.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[This reports a serious yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Cote d'Ivoire. Apparently, the cases have occurred in an _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission cycle in the main city of Abidjan. If that is the case, and there are many unvaccinated individuals, the outbreak could spread quickly. The proportion of the population that is unvaccinated is not stated, nor are specific plans for a vaccination campaign given.There have been YF cases in Cote d'Ivoire in the past, the most recent on in 2011. At that time more than 700 000 people were vaccinated against yellow fever [YF] in an emergency campaign in the country. There were YF cases in Abidjan in 2008, when the estimated vaccination coverage of the population was around 60 percent after a vaccination campaign. Now, time is of the essence to quickly halt the spread of YF, as it rapidly did in Angola and the DR Congo in that large outbreak.Maps of Cote d'Ivoire can be accessed at <http://bit.ly/2uHz53s> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/52>. - Mod.TY]
