Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/india-two-dozen-typhoid-cases-reported-krishna-district-vijayawada-42623/>At least 24 typhoid cases have been reported from Boddapadu village of Krishna district in Vijayawada metropolis [Andhra Pradesh], according to a local media report. Health officials suspect that water contamination in the village could be the reason for the disease. ""We are suspecting that water contamination, particularly in that place, has led to the outbreak of typhoid"", District Medical and Health Officer, TVSN Sastry said. ""We also directed the Panchayat Raj department to make sure proper sanitation and drinking water is provided in these areas to avoid future outbreaks,"" he added. The district health officials have deployed health teams comprising of 5 doctors in those regions to study the problem.Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi, is a life-threatening bacterial infection. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21 million people annually. Typhoid fever can be successfully treated with appropriate antibacterials, and treated persons usually begin to feel better within 2 to 3 days.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Typhoid fever is the classical human infection caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi. Unlike most salmonellae, _S._ Typhi is not zoonotic, being a pathogen only of humans, and may cause constipation and not diarrhea.As a reminder, the term abdominal typhus is still used in some places to refer to typhoid fever, since typhus (caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_) and typhoid fever (caused by _Salmonella_ Typhi) present quite similar symptoms, such as the fever pattern, the rash, and the cloudy mental state (also called coma vigil).For travelers to the developing world, especially VFRs (visitors to friends or relatives), there are 2 basic modalities to avoid this infection:- avoidance of risky drinks and foods and- vaccination.CDC summarizes these modalities on its website at <https://www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/index.html>:1. ""Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it""- if you drink water, buy it bottled or bring it to a rolling boil for 1 minute before you drink it. Bottled carbonated water is safer than uncarbonated water;- ask for drinks without ice unless the ice is made from bottled or boiled water;- avoid popsicles and flavored ices that may have been made with contaminated water;- eat foods that have been thoroughly cooked and that are still hot and steaming;- avoid raw vegetables and fruits that cannot be peeled. Vegetables like lettuce are easily contaminated and are very hard to wash well;- when you eat raw fruit or vegetables that can be peeled, peel them yourself. (Wash your hands with soap first.) Do not eat the peelings;- avoid foods and beverages from street vendors. It is difficult for food to be kept clean on the street, and many travelers get sick from food bought from street vendors.2. VaccinationsIf you are traveling to a country where typhoid is common, you should consider being vaccinated against typhoid. Visit a doctor or travel clinic to discuss your vaccination options.Remember that you will need to complete your vaccination at least 1-2 weeks (dependent upon vaccine type) before you travel so that the vaccine has time to take effect. Typhoid vaccines lose effectiveness after several years; if you were vaccinated in the past, check with your doctor to see if it is time for a booster vaccination. Taking antibiotics will not prevent typhoid fever; they only help treat it.The chart below provides basic information on typhoid vaccines that are available in the USA.Vaccine name / How given / Number Doses / Time between doses / BoosterTy21a / 1 capsule orally / 4 / 2 days / 5 yearsTyphim Vi / Injection / 1 / N/A / 2 years(The old parenteral heat-phenol-inactivated vaccine -- manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst -- has been discontinued).- Mod.LLMaps of India can be seen at <http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62437>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
