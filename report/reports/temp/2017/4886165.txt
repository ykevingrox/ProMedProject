""We have also reported this situation to state government through the ministries of health and local government for further action. We are waiting for the medical team to finish its work so as to know the cause of the outbreak. Even though there are many speculations about the outbreak, some people are relating it to unprotected and illegal mining activities, but we cannot conclude now until the medical experts finish their work,"" he said.The residents of the area had said that many people were affected by the disease which manifested in high fever, red eyes and swollen heads, culminating in death within 3 hours.A resident, KM, had told NAN that over 10 people had died in the village and that many others were rushed to General Hospital Dangulbi and the Yeriman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau for medical attention. According to him, the disease affected mostly women and children and called for a speedy response to curtail its spread.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[It is difficult to speculate on what the etiological agent of this illness might be. Death within 3 hours of symptoms is remarkable and makes one wonder whether a toxin is involved. Apparently, fewer men than women and children have been involved, which seems unusual as well, and suggests some kind of household exposure to whatever is causing the illness.ProMED-mail would appreciate any addition information on new cases or a specific diagnosis.Maps of Nigeria can be accessed at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.TY].................................................mpp/ty/msp/sh"
