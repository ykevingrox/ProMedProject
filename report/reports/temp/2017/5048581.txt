Global News [edited]<http://globalnews.ca/news/3429031/whooping-cough-outbreak-in-prince-albert-parkland-health-region/>The Prince Albert Parkland Health Region (PAPHR) [Saskatchewan] announced a whooping cough [pertussis] outbreak focused in its northwest portion on [Fri 5 May 2017].Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a serious and highly contagious infection of the lungs and throat caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria.The health region, Health Canada and surrounding First Nation communities [aboriginal peoples in Canada] are currently assessing and coordinating a response to the outbreak. ""Health Canada is working with First Nations communities  to promote the voluntary childhood vaccination program which ensures that children are up to date with their routine vaccinations,"" Dr Ibrahim Khan, regional medical health officer for Health Canada in Saskatchewan, said in a press release. ""Health Canada is working with and supporting the efforts of affected First Nation communities in providing enhanced immunization services for prenatal women in their third trimester.""PAPHR medical health officer Dr Khami Chokani is urging people to check their vaccination status. Health officials said young children who have not been immunized get sicker than older children and adults. ""Our immediate focus is to bring children and adults up-to-date with the pertussis vaccine,"" Chokani said. ""It is also important for parents and other caregivers to check their immunization status. In order to help contain the virus, it is important for everyone who can to be immunized.""Chokani added that if people are unsure about whether or not they are up to date with immunizations, they should contact their local public health office. According to PAPHR, people do not develop a permanent immunity to whooping cough and the disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated but symptoms are typically milder.[Byline: Thomas Piller]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Canada can be seen at <http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4218>.The Prince Albert Parkland Regional Health Region, located in the center of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, is one of 12 health regions in the province and is responsible for the delivery of health-care services for a population of 82 578 people, including 12 First Nations people, with a total on-reserve population of more than 9000 residents (<http://paphr.ca/about-us>); the largest community is the city of Prince Albert, with a population exceeding 44 000.

Yakima County health officials announced 4 confirmed cases in the district. The cases have appeared during the past 3 weeks, officials with the Yakima Health District said. The entire county had none in 2016. Granger School Superintendent Margarita Lopez did not return a message seeking comment as of press time.""This is why you need to get your immunization,"" Grandview School District Nurse Skitch Stanton said. Stanton said there are no pertussis cases in the Grandview School District.This sometimes happens in the spring,"" she said of outbreaks. ""Pertussis is not so bad for adults or school age children. The problem is they can have a light case and they give it to a grandparent or the parent of a newborn baby. It's something to keep an eye on.""Mabton School Superintendent Minerva Morales said her district has no cases to date. The same is true in Sunnyside schools, a district nurse, Becky Norem, said. The district is ready in the event of an outbreak, Sunnyside School District spokeswoman Jessica Morgan said. ""Doctor's orders are followed, which includes the student staying home from school until the medications have run their course,"" Morgan said. And district officials work with the health department ""... to identify people who came in close contact with the student and could potentially be affected,"" Morgan said.Yakima Health District officials said those who have the illness should remain isolated until a 5-day course of medication is complete.The public is asked to call 509-249-6541 to report a suspected or confirmed case of pertussis.[Byline: John Fannin]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Granger, with a population of 3246 residents, is a town in Yakima County, in the US state of Washington (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger,_Washington>).

There are 3 cases at the high school, 2 at the middle school and 1 each at Eagle and Slingerlands elementary schools, county spokeswoman Mary Rozak said. The outbreak is the 1st to occur statewide this year [2017], according to the state Health Department.Only 4 of the Bethlehem cases have been confirmed by laboratory reports. 3 students have symptoms fitting the definition of pertussis and also had contact with students whose cases were laboratory-confirmed, according to a note to parents from Jody Monroe, superintendent of the Bethlehem Central School District.Pertussis is highly contagious, and spreads through air droplets after an infected person sneezes or coughs. Infected people can spread the disease up to three weeks after they develop a cough from the illness. The illness is usually not serious, except for infants, said Dr Eric Schnakenberg of Community Care Family Medicine in Clifton Park. ""Typically, this is sort of a lingering cold, it will be kicking around for 6 weeks,"" Schnakenberg said. Treatment is recommended, however, to keep the illness from spreading, he said. Serious complications include pneumonia, impaired brain function and even death, according to the state Health Department.Most schoolchildren in New York must be vaccinated for pertussis. The vaccine is effective, but wanes over time, requiring booster shots. Because the protection decreases over time, even people who have been vaccinated can catch pertussis. ""The immunity tends to wane, so at age 11 we recommend all the kids get a booster,"" Schnakenberg said. Booster vaccinations are also recommended for anyone who expects to be in close contact with babies, he said, including pregnant women, child-care or health-care workers, or parents and grandparents of infants.There have been no other reported cases of pertussis in the county this year [2017]. Last year [2016], there were 10 cases countywide, and in 2015, there were 5. Statewide, so far in 2017, there have been 119 cases of pertussis, compared to 220 cases at this time last year. There have been isolated clusters and sporadic cases around the state this year, but no outbreaks outside Bethlehem, according to the state Health Department. Schnakenberg said outbreaks are infrequent.""Since the pertussis vaccine has been available since 1990, there's been a dramatic decrease in whooping cough in this country,"" he said. Pertussis does tend to spike every three to five years, however, according to state health officials. The last such increase was in 2012, when more than 3000 New Yorkers contracted the illness. More than 500 of those patients were in Suffolk County, according to state Health Department data. There were 58 cases in Albany County that year, and 168 in the 4-county Capital Region.[Byline: Claire Hughes]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Bethlehem, with a population of 33 656 residents, is a town in Albany County in the US state of New York.

But the outbreak has since spread to include 32 confirmed or suspected cases of whooping cough, said Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp, putting roughly 180 unvaccinated students at risk for infection.While symptomatic children have been encouraged to stay home, Rupp said unvaccinated students are no longer being ""excluded"" -- or quarantined -- because classes are scheduled to end [2 Jun 2017]. ""Now it's more or less everywhere,"" Rupp said. ""We've elected to not pursue those exclusions and just let the school year play out.""Rupp said whooping cough is relatively common, with roughly 50 cases reported in Salt Lake County during 2016. The disease ebbs and flows on a multiyear cycle, he said, with the county reporting more than 60 confirmed or suspected cases so far this year. ""We're on the upswing,"" Rupp said. ""AISU is certainly contributing to that increase.""Utah law requires that public school students be vaccinated, but allows parents to declare an exemption and opt out for any reason. The Salt Lake County Health Department recommends schools have an opt-out rate no higher than 5 percent to achieve ""herd immunity,"" or the rate at which vaccination is so prevalent the spread of a disease is effectively halted.At the American International School of Utah in Murray, the vaccination opt-out rate is 11 percent. Rupp said there is ""no doubt"" the high number of unvaccinated children contributed to the spread of pertussis. ""We are struggling to control the outbreak because of that exemption rate,"" he said. ""The lack of vaccination is a problem.""The health department sent a letter to AISU staff and parents [Tue 16 May 2017], encouraging sick children be treated by medical providers and kept home. The letter also encouraged families to complete immunizations if they had not already done so. ""The most important message is that if your child is not vaccinated, not adequately immunized, please consider getting it done,"" Rupp said.Kelly Casaday, AISU's director of operations, said the school's attendance rates have returned to normal since last month's [April 2017] school closure, but the outbreak disrupted end-of-year events like testing, and a choir concert other schools were invited to participate in has been rescheduled. We're going to postpone that two weeks,"" Casaday said. ""We don't want to put anybody else at risk."" He said students and staff have been told to assume any health issues are the result of whooping cough and to stay home from school. He also said several parents have indicated they will reconsider their vaccine exemptions as a result of the outbreak.[Byline: Benjamin Wood]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The American International School of Utah is a 3-year-old public charter school for tuition-paying international and non- tuition-paying local students from grades K-12 in Murray, Utah.
