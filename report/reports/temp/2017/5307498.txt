WFAE-NPR News Source, Charlotte, NC [edited]<http://wfae.org/post/deadly-bird-flu-china-evolves-spreads-new-regions>This past year [2017], China had the largest outbreak of a deadly bird flu since the virus was 1st detected in March 2013.For the past 5 years, China has had annual waves of H7N9 outbreaks that peak around January and February. During the 2017 season, the country reported nearly the same number of cases as all 4 previous years combined, researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday [7 Sep 2017]. The virus cropped up in more geographic regions, and it showed signs of evolving in ways that cause concern.As NPR reported in April [2017], the virus has picked up mutations that make it more deadly in poultry and less susceptible to antiviral treatments. ""Our research shows it can kill all the chickens in our lab within 24 hours,"" virologist Guan Yi told NPR.H7N9 isn't your run-of-the-mill bird flu. H7N9 is ""the influenza virus with the highest potential pandemic risk,"" the CDC writes in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.In people, H7N9 can cause a severe form of pneumonia and progress into septic shock and multiorgan failure. ""We know of only a small number of people who presented with influenza-like symptoms and then recovered without medical attention,"" the World Health Organization says.During the 2017 outbreak, the Chinese government reported 759 cases of H7N9. There were 281 deaths, about 1/3rd of those infected. By comparison, in 2016 and 2015, the country reported 123 and 226 cases, respectively.Although H7N9 has potential to evolve into a global threat, right now, it has one severe limitation that restricts its potential to spread: The virus doesn't transmit easily between people. About 90 percent of people catch the virus by handling poultry. But person-to-person transmission is possible. During 2017, there were 14 clusters of cases in which a person passed the disease to at least one other person.Since March 2013, there have been 1557 cases of H7N9 reported worldwide. All infections were caught in China, Hong Kong, or Macao. Nearly 40 percent of those infections were deadly.[Byline: Michaeleen Doucleff]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The 1st human cases of disease due to infection with a type A influenza virus of the strain H7N9 was announced in China in March 2013. At that time, the source of infection was not known, and the report was followed by reinforced surveillance in bird populations in China.On 4 Apr 2013, the Chinese Veterinary authorities notified the occurrence of infection of pigeons and chickens with low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus H7N9 to the OIE, which was very similar to the virus infecting humans.Between April 2013 and August 2015 (date when the last report was sent to the OIE), 43 ""outbreaks"" of LPAI H7N9 (""sub-clinical infections"") in poultry were reported. The event was declared resolved in a final follow-up report submitted to the OIE on 31 Aug 2015, and no more reports were submitted.In early 2017, a new HPAI mutant was found in human patients; according to information published on 19 Feb 2017 by China's CDC, the agricultural sector laboratory in Guangdong identified an apparent HPAI mutation of the H7N9 strain in 4 poultry specimens, which was eventually shown to be similar to the new mutant in humans. The new HPAI H7N9 virus strain was officially reported to the OIE on 18 Feb 2017, although at this stage there was no information on its actual clinical impact on poultry. Clinical disease and mortalities in commercial poultry were 1st reported from China to the OIE on 24 Mar 2017 (see 20170324.4924555). - Mod.ASA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155>.]
