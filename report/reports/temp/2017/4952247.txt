As of [28 Mar 2017], 55 confirmed emm74 GAS infections and 14 carriers have been detected (5 invasive and 50 non-invasive confirmed cases) and 1 person has died.Since March 2016, all GAS infections (both invasive and non-invasive) from residents of 2 floors at the shelter (later testing of shelter clients from a 3rd floor was added) were 1st evaluated using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) at the Public Health Ontario (PHO) Laboratory in Toronto, Ontario and then referred to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba for emm typing. The outbreak-associated shelter cases of emm74 have a single PFGE pattern.During the spring and summer of 2016, a much smaller cluster of emm101 (10 confirmed cases/4 carriers as of [28 Mar 2017]), which was a previously known type in Toronto, was simultaneously detected at the shelter but no further cases of this emm type have been identified since.GAS of type emm74 had not been detected in invasive GAS cases in Toronto for many years according to the surveillance coordinated by the Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network (TIBDN). This type was detected initially by the Network in December 2015 and in temporal association with this outbreak, there has been a substantial increase in iGAS [invasive GAS infection] due to emm74 in the local community. Provincially, emm74 had not been identified in Ontario between 2011 and 2015. TPH has been greatly assisted in its investigation by the PHO laboratory who has also undertaken additional whole-genome sequence analyses of this GAS type. The emm74 outbreak strains are highly clonal in nature, differing by less than twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms genome-wide.--Dr. Michael FinkelsteinAssociate Medical Officer of HealthToronto Public Health<mfinkel@toronto.ca>[ProMED mail is grateful to the Toronto Public Health for this description of the outbreak of group A streptococcal disease in residents of Seaton House, a shelter for homeless in Toronto, and the results of genotyping.Genotyping has established that this outbreak is mainly due to a single clone of emm74. - Mod.ML""emm74"" refers to the streptococcal gene encoding the M74 protein.  M proteins are major determinants of virulence and immunity in GAS infections and immunity to GAS is serotype-specific. Outbreaks tend to occur when a novel serotype is introduced into a population.  Since most strain typing is now done genetically rather than serologically, the nomenclature ""emm"" is used to refer to the gene rather than the protein. - Mod.LMA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/260>.][See Also:Streptococcus, group A - Canada: (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, RFI 20170402.4942679  20170401.4941512Streptococcus, group A - USA: (AK) fatal, new strain, homeless, RFI 20170215.48400762016----Streptococcus, group A - USA: (AK) fatal, new strain, homeless native men, RFI 20161130.4664201].................................................ml/ao/lm"
