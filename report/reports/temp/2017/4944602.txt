Nigeria Today [edited]<http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2017/04/new-strain-of-meningitis-fg-secures-500000-vaccines-from-w-h-o/>In a bid to tackle the menace and spread of the cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM), the Federal government said it has secured not less than 500 000 meningococcal vaccines which will be used in Zamfara and Katsina States, respectively.Since the outbreak of the disease, in late 2016, Zamfara has experienced the highest number of deaths, losing 44 persons, while Katsina has lost 32.A press release made available to journalists by the Federal Ministry of Health further revealed that additional 800 000 units are expected from the British government on [Tue 4 Apr 2017]. ""By Tuesday [4 Apr 2017], there will be a meeting with the International Review Group of The World Health Organization (WHO) where request for additional vaccines shall be approved, as part of practical and medically certified efforts to stem this ugly incidence,"" the statement reads.The Minister of Health, Prof Isaac Adewole also assured Nigerians of the federal government's quick response in tackling the disease. ""We have started working with all the affected states in specific areas of collaboration on massive awareness and sensitization, laboratory investigation and analysis, proper documentation and disease surveillance techniques through the National Centre for Disease Control and National Primary Health Care Development Authority (NPHCDA) who have been of tremendous support since the outbreak. We are in constant discussion with World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, E-health Africa and other international health agencies for supplies of vaccines and injections,"" he said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Sun 2 Apr 2017Source: The Nation Online [edited]<http://thenationonlineng.net/41-die-of-meningitis-in-sokoto-state-commissioner/>The death toll as a result of the meningitis epidemic in Sokoto State [Nigeria] has now risen to 41, Health Commissioner Dr Balarabe Kakale has said. Kakale disclosed this to newsmen in Sokoto on Sunday [2 Mar 2017] when he gave an update on the state of high alert declared by the state government since [Mon 20 Mar 2017]. He said that the deaths were mostly recorded out of the nearly 600 clinically confirmed cases of meningitis in the 8 worst-hit local governments; Rabah, Kebbe, Tureta, Gada, Dange/Shuni, Wamakko, Kware and Bodinga.Kakale said, ""The epidemic was caused by the serogroup ""C'' strains of meningitis and not the serogroup ""A'' strains, which the people of the state had hitherto developed immunity for. This new strain of meningitis is deadlier than the dreaded Ebola disease as it kills within 4 to 6 hours of afflicting a patient. More than 80 per cent of the victims also had not been immunised, hence, the aggravation of the epidemic.""The commissioner further stated that the state government has embarked on a statewide, mass vaccination for the people of the state, against meningitis. He explained that over 700 000 persons, aged 1 to 30 years were being targeted across the 23 local governments of the state. Kakale further stressed the need for the people of the state to ensure that their children were fully immunised against the child killer diseases like measles, whooping cough, yellow fever and diphtheria, among others. ""They should also desist from self medication as adequate drugs and medications are provided by the state government for the free treatment of the patients.""""No fewer than 100 medical personnel comprising medical doctors, nurses, ambulances and other logistics are still operating across the state. The people should also desist attaching traditional beliefs like witchcraft and report all suspected cases of meningitis, measles and other diseases to the nearest health facility. We will not rest on our oars until the epidemic is fully mitigated, although the cases have drastically reduced. Some of the isolation camps hitherto set had since been closed in most of the local governments,'' Kakale said.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>******[3]Date: Sun 2 Apr 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]This information has not yet been verified.

This is according to the CSM [cerebrospinal meningitis] situation report by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on [28 Mar 2017]. I cannot ascertain the serogroup but the most common is NmC [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C].--Communicated by:EpiCore Surveillance Project memberJelili MustaphaBiomedical ScientistUniversity of Salford, UK******[5]Date: Sun 2 Apr 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]There are 4 cases, no deaths, and no lab confirmation as samples were not collected [Plateau State?]. However drugs have been commenced. The circulating strain in other affected states is NmC [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C].Plateau State is 1 of the states affected by the current outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis in Nigeria. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C is said to be responsible for the current outbreak. According to an official release, so far some 2500 cases have been reported in all the affected States, out of which 328 have been fatal.--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>******[6]Date: Mon 3 Apr 2017Source: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]A total of 5 cases have been reported in Plateau state and none is yet confirmed by blood culture.The outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis started on the [Tue 28 Mar 2017] in some states in Northern Nigeria. Already 90 Local Government Areas in 16 states have been affected. The death toll recorded so far is 328. The states affected include: Zamfara, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbe, Niger, Nassarawa, Jigawa, Abuja, Gombe, Tarawa, Yobe, Osun, Cross River, Lagos and Plateau. The Minister of Health said that neighbouring West African Countries are also facing similar health threats from _Neisseria meningitidis_.According to the Minister [of Health], the country is currently experiencing an outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) that has spread across the country and mostly affecting states in the upper parts of the country that fall within the African Meningitis Belt. Other countries that are facing similar outbreaks at the moment include our West-African neighbours like Niger, Chad, Cameroun, Togo, and Burkina Faso. This epidemic has come with a difference, as all previous epidemics were caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup 'A' but this year [2017] we are recording serogroup C in epidemic proportion for the 1st time. The worst CSM epidemics experienced in Nigeria occurred in 1996 (109 580 cases and 11 717 deaths), 2003 (4130 cases and 401 deaths), 2008 (9086 cases and 562 deaths), and 2009 (9086 cases and 562 deaths). Following these successive outbreaks, the World Health Organisation (WHO) instituted a mass vaccination campaign using a new conjugate vaccine the MenAfriVac-A in about 16 out of the 26 vulnerable countries (including Nigeria). It resulted in a reduction of over 94 per cent incidence of the disease in most countries, thus significantly reducing the risk of serogroup A.Some key lessons learnt from the MenAfriVac-A mass vaccination campaign and the recent happenings across the sub-region, are that although serogroup A was successfully displaced, other strains which were hitherto less significant can actually assume epidemic proportions. Thus efforts must continue towards preventing a rebound of the serogroup A and also preventing a potential replacement by all other strains, said the Minister.As at [Fri 31 March 31], 90 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 16 states of the Federation are so far affected by the new strain of CSM including Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbe, Niger, Nassarawa, Jigawa, FCT, Gombe, Tarawa, Yobe, Kano, Osun, Cross Rivers, Lagos and Plateau.A total number of 2524 people have been reportedly affected while the death toll has risen to 328. So far, a total 131 samples have been confirmed in the laboratory, out of which a majority is _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C. This current outbreak started in Zamfara State in the 50th week of 2016 (i.e. November 2016).--Communicated by:EpiCore Global Surveillance Project<promed@promedmail.org>[ProMED-mail thanks EpiCore Global Surveillance Project members for their prompt responses.A map of Nigerian states can be found at: <http://dailymail.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10360606_10203337420937904_71905998820449261_n.jpg>.
