Xinhua News Agency [edited]<http://www.coastweek.com/4023-Cholera-cases-go-up-in-Tanzanias-Zanzibar-archipelago.htm>A cholera outbreak across Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar has killed 1 person and infected 180 in 32 weeks, a senior official said [Tue 13 Jun 2017]. Fadhili Mohamed, Director of Disease Prevention from Zanzibar's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare said that there were 23 cases of cholera on [28 May 2017], but now the number went up more than 9 times with 1 death. He said that about 180 people have been admitted to the designated Chumbuni camp in Zanzibar's West-Unguja region following the outbreak of cholera.""This is an increase of more than 150 patients since the disease outbreak was reported with 23 cholera patients only,"" the official said, confirming the death of a patient, who was a 10-year-old child.The situation has forced the ministry to open up another cholera patient camp in Gamba area in Zanzibar's North-Unguja region, according to Mohamed. Mohamed reminded food vendors to adhere to regulations which prohibit the selling of food at congested areas. ""We are aware of some few people who are violating the by-laws. Anyone caught selling food in prohibited areas will be punished in accordance with the laws,"" he said. He added that the bad thing is that most of the affected people are children aged below ten years, calling for patients to consider cleaning their homes and ensure that children wash hands before and after eating.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Tanzania can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/tanzania/maps/tanzania-political-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/201>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Cholera - Somalia: WHODate: Sat 10 Jun 2017Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), ReliefWeb, WHO report [edited]<http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/weekly-update-cholera-somalia-10-june-2017>The Ministry of Health of Somalia has reported 2679 acute watery diarrhea (AWD)/cholera cases and 23 deaths for week 21 (22-29 May 2017). The cumulative figures for the cholera outbreak since the beginning of the year [2017] stands at 45 400 cases and 738 deaths. The case-fatality rate of 1.6 percent remains above the emergency threshold of 1 percent.While timely and effective interventions have limited the increase in cholera cases overall, new cases continue to be reported. Most of the cases were reported in Banadir region in Wadajir district, Luq in Gedo, Dusamareb, Galgadud, and Baidoa in Bay region and Buhodle Ayn region from Puntland.The health cluster, led by WHO, is working collaboratively with the Ministry of Health, partners, and health authorities to respond to the outbreak and implement preventative measures around the country.In Puntland, 59 mobile teams were deployed to IDP [internally displaced persons] settlements. In Somaliland, water purification teams were activated in Toghdeer and Sanag, integrated diarrhoeal disease kits (IDDK) were distribtued in affected regions as well as 500 Cary-Blair transport medium to collect and diagnose stool samples.The 2nd round of an oral cholera vaccination campaign was completed on [26 May 2017] for over 400 000 persons aged 1 year and older in Baidoa and Jowhar districts.Lack of rains for consecutive seasons and poor rainfall in Somalia has led to a severe drought that has killed livestock and crops, displaced hundreds of thousands of Somalis, and left around 6.2 out of 12.3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Nearly 5.5 million people are at risk of contracting water-borne diseases like cholera. While the Gu rainy season has brought in some relief, floods are now expected to increase the number of cholera cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Maps of Somalia can be seen at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/somalia.pdf> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/125>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):""For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.""The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).References----------57.
