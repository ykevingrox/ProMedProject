But why are we not talking about it? That's because 1st, the problem is only prevalent in poor provinces and not national in scope; 2nd, it's a poor man's disease and it doesn't hit the headlines,"" he said.Schistosomiasis in the Philippines accounts for almost 80 per cent of the burden [of this disease] in the western Pacific region.There are 2 major forms of schistosomiasis, intestinal and urogenital, caused by 5 species of blood fluke. Intestinal schistosomiasis caused by _Schistosoma japonicum_ is endemic in the Philippines. In the Philippines, the highest prevalence is among children ages 5 to 15.--communicated by:ProMED-MBDS<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>[Schistosomiasis caused by _Schistosoma japonicum_ is endemic in the Phillipines. Two recent studies found point-prevalences of 12.5 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, in Leyte (Liwanag HJ, et al. Soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis in children of poor families in Leyte, Philippines: lessons for disease prevention and control. J Trop Pediatr. 2017 Jan 23. pii: fmw078) and Northern Samar  (Olveda DU, et al. Biennial versus annual treatment for schistosomiasis and its impact on liver morbidity. Int J Infect Dis. 2017;54:145-9).The current control strategy recommended by WHO advocates mass drug administration with a single dose of 40mg/kg of praziquantel (PZQ). However, the current global coverage is 20 per cent, the drug compliance rate is less than 50 per cent, and the drug efficacy is about 50 per cent. Thus in reality, only about 5 per cent of the reservoir human population is actually receiving intermittent chemotherapy (Ross AG, et al. A new global strategy for the elimination of schistosomiasis. Int J Infect Dis. 2017 Jan;54:130-7). Schistosomiasis is a poverty-related disease and control needs an integrated approach, including sanitation and treatment of the animal reservoir. - Mod.EPZoonotic schistosomiasis has a long endemic history in the Philippines. The species of schistosome endemic in the Philippines is _S. japonicum_Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that silently takes away people's lives in poor areas. Aside from the Philippines, snail fever is also endemic in China and Indonesia. The mortality rate is 1.8 per cent among untreated patients. Transmission occurs when people suffering from schistosomiasis contaminate freshwater sources with their excreta containing parasite eggs, which hatch in water, says WHO. In the Philippines, the reservoirs of infection and environmental contamination include humans, cows, dogs, pigs, carabaos, field rats and monkeys because of open defecation especially in rural areas. <http://www.philstar.com:8080/headlines/2017/05/29/1704657/12-m-pinoys-risk-killer-bulate>.Schistosomiasis is a snailborne neglected tropical disease, affecting 78 countries and territories in Africa, Asia, South America and the Middle East. Three species are highly pathogenic to man, namely _Schistosoma japonicum_, _S. mansoni_ and _S. haematobium_._S. japonicum_ occurs mainly in China, the Philippines, and parts of Indonesia, and, unlike other forms of schistosomes, _S. japonicum_ can naturally infect humans and at least 46 other mammalian species.Dogs, cats and rats play a role in schistosomiasis transmission, with dogs and rats showing more consistent effects. Given the zoonotic nature of the disease in the Philippines there is the need for innovative cost-effective strategies to control _S. japonica_ in the long term.Maps of the Philippines can be seen at <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Labelled_map_of_the_Philippines_-_Provinces_and_Regions.png> and a Healthmap can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158>. - Mod.TTM]
