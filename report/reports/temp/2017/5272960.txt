Albuquerque Journal [edited]<https://www.abqjournal.com/1051686/mosquitoes-capable-of-transmitting-zika-found-in-socorro.html>Socorro County is now in the list of New Mexico counties with mosquitoes capable of transmitting Zika virus. Researchers have found _Aedes aegypti_ -- one of 2 mosquito species capable of transmitting the viral illness -- in the City of Socorro, the New Mexico Department of Health [DOH] said today [Tue 22 Aug 2017]. Socorro marks the northern-most location of _Aedes aegypti_ yet found in the state.No human cases of Zika virus have been identified in Socorro County to date. There have been no confirmed cases of Zika virus in New Mexico residents this year [2017]. In 2016, 10 cases of Zika virus disease were reported in New Mexico, but none was infected locally. In each case, travelers were infected abroad and diagnosed after they returned home.Researchers at New Mexico State University under contract with DOH are mapping the range and distribution of both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ -- the 2 species that can transmit Zika virus to people. The work began in 2016 when the viral illness was linked to severe birth defects in Brazil and other nations in the Americas. These species of mosquitoes become infected when they take blood from a person already infected with the virus. Once infected, the mosquitoes can bite and infect other people._Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been trapped and identified in DoÌ±a Ana, Eddy, Chaves, Sierra, Lea, Otero, Hidalgo, and Socorro counties. _Aedes albopictus_ has been found in Roosevelt County.[byline: Olivier Uyttebrouck]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Although _ Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found in southern New Mexico counties in earlier years, this is the 1st report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in Socorro county. Finding _Ae. aegypti_ in this county is not surprising. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in New Mexico. Both have been detected in southern New Mexico but the above report does not indicate if populations of the potential vectors are established and abundant enough to permit ongoing transmission. Thus far, no locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection in New Mexico have been documented. _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in new geographic areas in the USA.Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of viruses such as Zika, chikungunya or dengue into New Mexico will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors. - Mod.TYA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233>.]
