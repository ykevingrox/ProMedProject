Tick-borne encephalitis virus in ticks and roe deer, the Netherlands.Abstract----------We report the presence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in the Netherlands. Serologic screening of roe deer found TBEV-neutralizing antibodies with a seroprevalence of 2 percent, and TBEV RNA was detected in 2 ticks from the same location. Enhanced surveillance and awareness among medical professionals has led to the identification of autochthonous [human] cases.[Background]---------------TBEV is transmitted through bites of infected ticks to many animals, including deer, which serve as feeding hosts for ticks. Expansion of TBEV subtypes has been reported. Reports of TBEV-neutralizing antibodies in wildlife and cattle in Belgium prompted us to reinvestigate the presence of TBEV in the Netherlands.[Results]----------During January-September 2010, hunters collected 297 blood samples from roe deer (_Capreolus capreolus_) from locations across the Netherlands. We used a commercial ELISA to detect TBEV-reactive antibodies in roe deer serum samples. Serologic screening of all 297 samples by ELISA yielded 6 positive and 8 borderline results. All positive, 7 borderline, and 3 negative serum samples were confirmed by testing in a TBEV serum neutralization test (SNT), with the NeudÌ¦rfl strain as the accepted prototype TBEV-EU, formerly called central European encephalitis virus. 5 of 6 ELISA positive samples and 1 of 7 borderline samples were confirmed positive by SNT. 5 of the 6 SNT-confirmed roe deer were shot at or near a popular recreation area, the National Park Sallandse Heuvelrug.In response to the serologic findings, we collected 1160 nymph and 300 adult _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks by blanket dragging in 7 locations at the national park in September 2015. We extracted RNA from pools of 5 nymphs or 2 adults and tested for flavivirus by using a reverse transcription quantitative PCR. We detected flavivirus RNA in 1 nymph pool and 1 pool of adult female ticks.[Discussion]-------------The concentration of serologically positive roe deer is striking and remains unexplained. One explanation could be that this area has dense beech tree coverage, and beechnuts are a major food source for roe deer and the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_). These host species play a pivotal role in the TBEV enzootic cycle; a habitat suitable for both may have enhanced the local establishment and spread of TBEV. In addition, the finding of a serologically positive roe deer in a southern province of the Netherlands, also known for the presence of beech trees, suggests that TBEV is distributed more widely within the Netherlands.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The cluster of seropositive deer in National Park Sallandse Heuvelrug suggests that the virus may be present in a focal area of transmission. It would be interesting to know whether bank voles in this locality and elsewhere in the Netherlands are also infected with TBE virus.

Tickborne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TYMaps of the Netherlands can be seen at <http://www.map-of-netherlands.co.uk/images/netherlands-politcal-map.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58972>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
