Straits Times [edited]<http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/21-year-old-construction-worker-dies-from-diphtheria-in-first-confirmed-case-in>A 21 year old construction worker from Bangladesh has died from the respiratory disease diphtheria in the 1st confirmed case in Singapore in more than 20 years.The Ministry of Health said in a statement on Sat 5 Aug 2017 that the patient, who lived at Yishun Avenue 7 and worked at Teban Gardens, developed fever and swelling of the neck on 30 Jul 2017. On Tue 1 Aug 2017, he sought medical treatment at Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital, where he was immediately isolated and hospitalised. He died 3 days later on Fri 4 Aug 2017. His respiratory sample tested positive for toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, which causes the disease.""As he had not travelled out of Singapore recently, he was likely to have been infected in Singapore,"" said the ministry in its statement. The last local case of diphtheria was reported in 1992, while the last imported case was in 1996.The respiratory disease is preventable by vaccine, and the risk of it spreading here is low. Vaccination against diphtheria has been made compulsory by law for children under the National Childhood Immunisation Programme since 1962. About 96 to 98 per cent of Singaporean children aged 2 years old are vaccinated against the disease. The ministry also added that it is screening the patient's close contacts, including those who lived in the same dormitory and worked in the same workplace.Among the 48 people who have been identified for ""further assessment"", 2 ""close contacts"" have developed sore throat since Thu 3 Aug 2017. They are currently under isolation at Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital. ""All 48 contacts have been given preventive medication and a booster diphtheria vaccine, and their respiratory samples have been taken for testing,"" said the ministry.Diphtheria is transmitted from person to person via the respiratory route through close contact with an affected person. Symptoms include fever or chills, sore throat, swelling of the neck, and nasal discharge. The disease can cause infection of the airway, which may lead to breathing difficulties and death. It is fatal in 5-10 per cent of cases, with a higher fatality rate among young children.The best way to prevent diphtheria is to get vaccinated, which reduces the mortality and morbidity of the disease ""dramatically"", said the ministry.[byline: Charmaine Ng]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The organism that causes diphtheria is _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ that is infected by a bacteriophage (lysogenized) that carries the gene encoding the diphtheria toxin (a toxigenic strain). The diphtheria toxin is responsible both for local tissue destruction and membrane formation in the nose and throat and the major complications of acute renal failure, myocarditis and neuritis. The membrane itself may cause airway obstruction.Humans are the reservoir for _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, which is transmitted by droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected person. Diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin to stop the effects of the toxin and antibiotics to eradicate the organism. Vaccination of clinical cases is required because clinical diphtheria does not necessarily confer immunity.Diphtheria patients are usually kept in isolation until they are no longer contagious, as demonstrated by negative cultures of 2 samples obtained at least 24 hours apart after completion of a 14 day course of antimicrobial therapy, although patients are usually no longer contagious about 48 hours after starting antibiotics (<https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/close-contacts.pdf>).All close contacts of a case should be monitored for signs/symptoms of diphtheria for at least 7 days and have swabs taken for culture from their throat and nose, regardless of their immunization status. A prophylactic course of 7 days of oral erythromycin or a single dose of benzathine penicillin IM is recommended for close contacts. Close contacts with positive cultures should have 2 repeat cultures a minimum of 2 weeks after completion of antimicrobials to assure eradication of the organism, and, if repeat cultures are positive, an additional 10-day course of erythromycin or penicillin is recommended, followed by 2 repeat cultures. Unvaccinated contacts should be started on their primary course of vaccine. Vaccinated contacts should be given a booster injection of vaccine if more than 5 years have elapsed since their previous dose (<https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/close-contacts.pdf>).Teban Gardens, where the patient worked, is a residential precinct located in Jurong East, a planning area in the West Region of Singapore (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teban_Gardens>). Yishun Avenue 7, where the patient lived, is in the Yishun planning area in North Region of Singapore (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishun>).
