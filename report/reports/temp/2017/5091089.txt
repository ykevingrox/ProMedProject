The West Australian [edited]<https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/food-poisoning-link-to-eggs-ng-b88500374z>West Australians [WA] are being warned to avoid eating raw or partly cooked eggs because of a surge in cases of salmonellosis. Reports of salmonella gastroenteritis are at records levels and have been linked to particular molecular types associated with eggs. The WA Health Department said yesterday, 6 Jun 2017, there had been 713 reported infections from _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium by the end of April 2017, which was more than 4 times the usual number. The infection was commonly associated with consumption of foods containing raw or under-cooked eggs. A number of egg brands had been implicated.A spokeswoman said cases of salmonellosis had been increasing in WA since 2015 but had accelerated since late 2016. ""There are 2 molecular subtypes, PFGE1 and PFGE43, that are currently causing most of this increase,"" she said. ""Epidemiological evidence from investigations of identified localised outbreaks and a large case-control study of community cases indicates that eating raw or runny eggs is a significant cause of illness. This includes breakfast dishes containing eggs, and desserts and aioli made with raw eggs.""Environmental investigations indicated some outbreaks had been caused by poor handling of egg products at the food manufacturing and preparation level and by consumers. The department said that while eggs were a good source of vitamins and minerals, like many other foods they could be contaminated with bacteria, including salmonellae. It was important to handle and prepare eggs safely to reduce the food poisoning risk.""The department recommends that people don't use cracked or dirty eggs in raw egg dishes,"" she said. ""If possible, it is best to avoid any uncooked foods or dishes that contain raw egg. ""This is because it is impossible to guarantee the safety of eating raw eggs and dishes that contain unpasteurized raw egg products.""People were advised to prepare egg dishes as close as possible to the time of eating them and refrigerate them at or below 5 deg C [41 deg F]. It was important to wash and dry hands thoroughly after handling eggs.[Byline: Cathy O'Leary]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/289>.]
