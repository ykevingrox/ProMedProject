GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network) [edited]<http://www.gideononline.com>Re: Salmonellosis, st Dublin - USA: (WA) unpasteurized milk Archive Number: 20171008.5366537--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Gideon database (<www.GideonOnline.com>) chronicles 21 971 outbreaks of infectious diseases which have been published to date, including 1591 (7.2%) of salmonellosis. A total of 10 of the outbreaks (2 in the USA) involved serotype Dublin associated with dairy products. As many as 383 salmonellosis outbreaks (24.1 percent of the global total) occurred in the USA. Where a vehicle is specified, dairy products were implicated in 9.4 percent of the latter.--Communicated by:Prof. Steve BergerGeographic MedicineTel Aviv Medical CenterIsrael<steve@gideononline.com>[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, Lynch M, Angulo FJ and Mahon BE.: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws - United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91, available at: <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article>), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.
