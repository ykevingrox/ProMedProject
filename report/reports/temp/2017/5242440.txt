Garda World [edited]<https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/54731>There are 176 cases of encephalitis in Hanoi, with 24 of these diagnosed as Japanese encephalitis [JE].Typical encephalitis is spread via mosquito bite, with symptoms including headache, fever, aches in muscles or joints, fatigue, or weakness. The symptoms of the more serious Japanese encephalitis include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, difficulty moving, swelling around the brain, and coma.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Occurrence of multiple cases of JE in Viet Nam at this time of year is not surprising. Viet Nam is endemic for the virus, which has birds (especially herons and their relatives) as reservoirs and pigs as amplifying hosts. Mosquitoes in the _Culex_ genus are virus vectors, and are abundant in wetlands.Maps of Viet Nam can be seen at <http://www.onlineasiatravel.com/images/vn/vietnam-map.png> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54000>. - Mod.TY]******[2] China (Hong Kong): blood transfusionDate: Fri 21 Jul 2017 10:34 PM HKTSource: South China Morning Post [edited]<http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/2103667/hong-kong-tackles-worlds-first-case-patient>Hong Kong health authorities are tackling the world's 1st case of a patient contracting the potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease, Japanese encephalitis (JE), through a blood transfusion.Doctors said the other 2 patients had not shown any symptoms, though one of them died of a brain haemorrhage after undergoing surgery earlier this month [July 2017].While the globally unprecedented case put the focus on the city's current blood donation policy, which does not require testing for JE, health officials ruled out changing the system.University of Hong Kong microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-yung said there was no need to start screening blood donations for JE as the chance of infection was very low.""This is a very rare and unfortunate case,"" he said, adding that the lung transplant operation could have made the patient more vulnerable to the JE virus.""From a medical point of view, I don't see the need to develop a mass screening test, unless there is a surge in the cases of JE virus infection in Hong Kong.""There have been only 3 cases of the disease so far this year [2017], and only one in 100 infected people show symptoms such as headache, high fever and neck stiffness, usually between 4-14 days after contracting the virus. It may lead to a swelling of the brain and death.Yuen added that it was practically impossible to check the Red Cross blood bank for the JE virus, and there was no need for public alarm.""I hope this case won't discourage the general public from donating blood in future,"" he said.Dr Lee Cheuk-kwong of the Red Cross suggested that in addition to filling in questionnaires regarding their health, donors should report any symptom of illness after giving blood.Investigations revealed that the donor, a 46-year-old man living in Tin Shui Wai and working in Kwun Tong, had given blood through the Red Cross mobile donation service on 29 May [2017]. He had passed all required health tests and showed no symptoms of JE. The donor had visited London in May [2017], but could not recall whether he had been bitten by mosquitoes. Centre for Health Protection controller Dr Wong Ka-hing said there was a very high chance he had been infected locally.The patient suffering from brain haemorrhage received the infected blood on 20 Jun [2017], and died after surgery on 4 Jul [2017] due to bleeding. He was not tested for JE, but did not show symptoms of the virus [infection] either.Another patient being treated for leukaemia at Queen Mary underwent a transfusion with the infected blood on 2 Jun [2017], but was discharged on 14 Jul [2017] without showing any JE symptoms.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Transmission of JE virus via blood transmission is a rare event, indeed. Human viremias are of low magnitude and of short duration. The donor was probably early in the viremic phase and probably had no fever. Because this is such a rare event, it doubtless explains why there is reluctance to undergo the cost and efforts needed to screen blood and blood products for JEV.Maps of Hong Kong can be seen at <http://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/hongkong/hongkong-map.gif> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/198>. - Mod.TY]
