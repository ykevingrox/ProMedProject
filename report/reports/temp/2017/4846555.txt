She developed high-grade fever with shortness of breath [for the] past one week. She then visited Nepalgunj Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Kohalpur, Banke district, where she was diagnosed with scrub typhus. She was prescribed doxycycline for 10 days. After 2 days of antibiotic, her fever resolved completely.She was a resident of Khungri Village Development Committee-4, Rolpa district (Rapti Zone, Province Five, Mid-Western region of Nepal), and had no history of travel outside her native village.[Over the] last year (2016-17) scrub typhus has spread explosively, particularly in the rainy season, in southeastern region of Nepal. This index case, however, indicates the possible spread of scrub typhus in the western region of Nepal, showing no specific seasonal patterns in Nepal.--Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, MD, PhDClinical Research UnitSukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease HospitalKathmanduNepal<drsherbdr@yahoo.com>[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his continued contributions.Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of a 6-legged chigger, the larval form of the trombiculid family of 8-legged mites. Chiggers are most active during warmer summer months (<https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2000/06/got-chiggers-it-figures>). They live in shaded grassy areas and tend to be more abundant during rainy spells because they need a high-level of humidity in order to survive. During the heat of the afternoon or during long dry spells, they may retreat toward the soil. Once chiggers have fed on humans, they drop off their host and transform into nymphs, which then develop into adult mites that feed on plant material and are harmless to humans.Nepal is divided into 3 geographic regions: 1) The southern lowland plains or Terai, with a subtropical to tropical climate, borders India; 2) the northern mountain region, which contains the highest elevations in the world (8848 meters or 29 029 ft), borders China; and 3) in between the southern lowlands and the mountain region is the Hill region, 800 to 4000 meters (2625 to 13 123 ft) in altitude with progression from subtropical climates below 1200 meters (3937 ft), to a temperate climate between 1200 to 2400 meters (3,937 to 7,874 ft), and then to an alpine climate above 3600 meters (11 811 ft) with subtropical river valleys (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal>). Nepal experiences 5 seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, winter, and spring.The patient above resided in the Rolpa district in the Hill region 280 km (174 miles) west of Kathmandu in Province Five, midwestern Nepal. Most of Rolpa has a subtropical or temperate climate (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolpa_District>).
