A priori, to have toxic levels must be the result of seriously poor manufacturing practice!--James DickinsonDepartment of Family MedicineUniversity of CalgaryCalgary, AlbertaCanada<dickinsj@ucalgary.ca>[It is possible that in this case the company called it homeopathic but in reality it may not be truly homeopathic. If there were various levels of belladonna, enough to cause death, then clearly it could not be a true homeopathic 'remedy'. It could possibly be poor quality management, a mistake during manufacturing, or perhaps the source of the belladonna had changed. Likely there is more to this situation than has been released to the public. - Mod.TG][See Also:Poisoning, belladonna - USA: homeopathic teething product recall2016----Poisoning, belladonna - USA: homeopathic teething product susp. 20161023.4578600].................................................tg/mj/mpp"
