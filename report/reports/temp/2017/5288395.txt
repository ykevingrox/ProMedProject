Romania Insider [edited]<https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-west-nile-2017/>A total of 16 cases of meningitis and meningo-encephalitis with West Nile virus were registered in Romania between [9 May and 30 Aug 2017], which resulted in 6 deaths, according to data from the Ministry of Health.Half of the deaths were registered in Bucharest, with the other 3 being reported in Buzau, Braila, and Olt.""The Ministry of Health emphasizes that all these cases, detected and registered in Romania, are sporadic cases and don't pose the risk of a large epidemic,"" reads the Ministry's press release.West Nile virus is most commonly transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Most people infected with this virus will have no symptoms, and about one in 5 individuals who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms, according to information posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.Doctors recommend people to reduce the risk of getting infected by using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing to prevent mosquito bites.Last year, 80 people were infected with West Nile virus in Romania between [1 May and 29 Sep 2016], and 8 of them died.[Byline: Irina Marica]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[There have been studies in Romania that provide evidence that wild birds are involved in local West Nile disease enzootic and epizootic cycles. This in turn allows virus maintenance and spread and also enhances the chance of new outbreaks. Pastiu et al demonstrated a high prevalence of WNV antibodies in both domestic (19.1 percent) and wild (32.1 percent) birds captured after the human epidemic in 2010 (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26824796>). That indicates that the virus is in circulation in the country, leading to periodic outbreaks. - Mod.UBAMaps of Romania can be seen at <http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/romania/ro111aa/romania_pol.jpg> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/122>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
