The San Diego Union-Tribune [edited]<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/editorials/sd-hepatitis-a-outbreak-20170927-story.html>This may wind up as San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer's Katrina, but it's clear all 5 San Diego county supervisors were asleep at the switch, too. This month September 2017, after lacking it for months, city and county officials finally showed a sense of urgency, ramping up vaccination, sanitation, and education, to fight the nation's worst hepatitis A outbreak since a vaccine was rolled out in 1995. Now, San Diego officials have expanded sidewalk power-washing far beyond its downtown core, as cases crop up in Orange, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz counties as well as across San Diego County, from El Cajon to Chula Vista to Oceanside. 1/3 of our county's 461 cases are neither homeless nor illicit drug users.Faulconer has mobilized and is now sharing frequent social media updates. But the problem is so bad that firefighters in Spring Valley may have been exposed to the virus while battling a vegetation fire in a homeless camp, Ocean Beach residents are cleaning out coastal encampments, and county officials have heard urgent pleas to help clean up feces and filth along the San Diego River for weeks.Cooperation at the highest levels of government is essential to keep this from spiraling even more out of control. City-county emails dating to May [2017] show repeated slow activity. But at least the city responded quickly to a request for those emails. The county has yet to release its own emails about hepatitis A.[Byline: The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.

That individual, who unlike the 1st Orange County case of hepatitis A was not a homeless person, has recovered without requiring hospitalization, MacDonald said.The San Diego connection was determined by the CDC. The CDC performed genetic testing of the person's virus which was found to match the strain seen in San Diego, according to Dr Mathew Zahn, Orange County's medical director of epidemiology and assessment. What is uncertain is how the infected person contracted the disease. The individual is not known to have traveled to San Diego, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency. That differs from the county's 1st case, diagnosed in July 2017, which involved a homeless person who had spent time in San Diego.""The virus is passed by some sort of social contact with an infected person but we don't have a specific theory as to how the person developed infection,"" Zahn said by email in response to questions about the 2nd hepatitis A case.Last week [week of 18 Sep 2017], Los Angeles County declared its own outbreak of hepatitis A when the number of diagnosed cases reached 10 people. Santa Cruz County also is dealing with an outbreak. Orange County health officials are hoping to prevent local spread of the disease by offering free vaccinations at pop-up clinics in locations where homeless people reside or where they receive other services. Vaccinations are also being provided in jails and where addicts who inject intravenous drugs exchange dirty needles for clean ones.The San Diego outbreak dates back to November 2016 and has raged through that city's homeless population, particularly vulnerable to spread of the disease because of poor sanitation where they typically live. San Diego officials have been heavily criticized for not responding more swiftly and broadly. Hepatitis A has also spread to the general population there.""San Diego has seen several cases of persons in the general population developing infection without an obvious exposure, just as in this situation,"" Zahn said. ""So it is not a surprise to see this event occur in Orange County. Cases in San Diego's general population have not generally led to larger outbreaks. But we are aggressively following up on this case to assure that no additional cases occur.""[Byline: Theresa Walker]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[3] Utah (Salt Lake county)Date: Wed 27 Sep 2017 6:55 PM MDTSource: Deseret News [edited]<http://tinyurl.com/y9fvhwmh>Health officials say Salt Lake county's homeless are encountering an ""outbreak"" of hepatitis A, and that the disease is believed to be related to the strain that has killed 17 people in San Diego [California] in 2017. In all, 25 ""outbreak-related"" cases of hepatitis A have been reported in the county since the start of 2017, said Irene Risk, director of epidemiology for the Salt Lake County Health Department. There were 6 cases reported in the 1st 16 days of September 2017 alone.Officials are ""not sure if the outbreak has peaked yet,"" and reported that none of those cases have turned fatal. ""What I'm hoping is that we don't see that peak go up. It takes on average 30 days to develop symptoms after you're exposed. It's hard to tell where we're at,"" Risk said.More than 1/2 of the cases have led to hospitalizations, Utah Department of Health spokeswoman Jenny Johnson said. Typically, there are about 4 cases of hepatitis A in Salt Lake County per year, according to Risk.Those who are suffering from hepatitis A are overwhelmingly homeless, said Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp, in large part because ""for those experiencing homelessness, there are not always opportunities to cleanse properly (or even find) an appropriate place to use the restroom.""Risk told the Deseret News ""there's no reason to think that the general population is at risk."" Rupp added that illicit drug users have also been disproportionately affected in Salt Lake County's outbreak.More than 450 hepatitis A cases have been reported since November [2016] in a San Diego area outbreak largely affecting homeless people, including 17 fatalities. Salt Lake County health officials first confirmed in early July 2017 that the local cases ""are the same strain"" affecting people in San Diego, Risk said. ""We looked at the pathogen and looked at whether it was the exact phenotype and the same strain and we found out that it was,"" she said. Risk was quick to add that ""I don't think that we will reach those levels"" of cases as seen in San Diego. But ""as far as the scope (in Salt Lake County), it's very concerning and we're taking a lot of actions."" Those actions consist primarily of widespread vaccinations, Rupp said, 780 so far.Rupp spoke positively of Operation Rio Grande, the crackdown aimed removing crime and drug use from downtown, saying it would improve overall health ""long term"" among those who are homeless. But he said the effort also dispersed many of the people believed to be at risk of hepatitis A, adding a hurdle to vaccination efforts. ""They've spread further throughout the (Salt Lake) Valley, so it's more complicated and more time consuming to reach more people, because we have to reach more places,"" he said. ""It's been a little more challenging with them dispersed throughout the community, rather than within more or less a few blocks.""Risk said workers have been going to anywhere where they know they can find homeless people and drug users, including drug rehabilitation clinics, parks and outdoor events, taking the vaccinations with them and often administering them on the spot. ""We always are looking for those kinds of opportunities,"" she said.[Byline: Ben Lockhart]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Utah can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4394>.

We are taught that the incidence of acute fulminant hepatitis is about 1-2 per 1000 cases and not all of these die. The numbers are certainly skewed towards individuals who are sicker and may not count the many milder cases that are not reported.A figure of HAV cases per age group for 2000-2015 <https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2015surveillance/index.htm#tabs-4-5> clearly shows that not only has the overall rate of HAV infection dramatically dropped, probably in large part related to HAV immunization, but is most dramatic in children and adolescents. - Mod.LL]
