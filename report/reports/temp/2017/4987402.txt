Orlando Sentinel [edited]<http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/brinkmann-on-business/os-la-fitness-ocoee-legionnaires-20170420-story.html>State health officials hope to know early next week if an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease was definitely linked to the LA Fitness gym in Ocoee. A total of 3 people who went to the gym at 1560 E. Silver Star Road recently contracted the disease, according to the Florida Department of Health in Orange County. The disease can result in a severe form of pneumonia.LA Fitness followed health department recommendations to decontaminate its hot tub and change out shower heads, said Alvina Chu, epidemiology program manager with the health department.She declined to provide the status of the gym-goers who became ill, citing confidentiality rules. She said it's common for patients with Legionnaires' [disease] to be hospitalized. ""They had gone to the gym in the exposure window, a few days before they became ill,"" Chu said. ""We continuously look for other exposures, and this was the common one we found.""LA Fitness shut off access to the showers and hot tub upon being notified by the state, then installed specially filtered shower heads that eliminate bacteria from the shower stream, she said.State investigators pulled water samples from the gym before steps were taken to clean up the facility. Those samples have been sent to a lab in Jacksonville, Chu said. ""It takes 7 days to grow out the samples, so we should know something by [Mon 24 Apr 2017] or [Tue 25 Apr 2017],"" she said.The LA Fitness media office didn't respond to requests for comment.Legionnaires' is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which naturally exists in the general environment and fresh water. It generally cannot spread from person to person, and can be found in man-made water systems such as hot tubs, spas, hot-water tanks and other pumping systems. Symptoms are similar to other forms of pneumonia, including coughing, high fever and shortness of breath. Symptoms present themselves within 2 days to 2 weeks after exposure.Over the past few years, Legionnaire's disease was investigated at Florida Hospital and at SpringHill Suites Hotel in Altamonte Springs.Some people are at higher risk of getting Legionnaire's, including people 50 or older, current or former smokers, people with a chronic lung disease (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema); people with weak immune systems from diseases like cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure; and people who take drugs that weaken the immune system such as those prescribed after a transplant operation or chemotherapy.In January 2016, Florida Hospital Orlando's water tested positive for _Legionella_, leading the hospital to hire a firm to flush its water system. The chain of events began in late 2015, when a critically ill patient at Florida Hospital Orlando tested positive for _Legionella_, but the hospital said there were no instances of people acquiring the disease at the hospital. The strain of _Legionella_ found in the hospital water system was different from the one the patient had.Each year, between 8000 and 18 000 people in the United States need care in a hospital because of Legionnaires' disease, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[Byline: Paul Brinkmann]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A spa pool (a.k.a hot tub or whirlpool spa), operated in homes or commercial facilities, can be a source for legionellosis. ProMED-mail has posted several outbreaks of legionnaires' disease traced back to a hot tub (see also's below)._Legionella_ are commonly found in natural waters, such as lakes and rivers, usually in low bacterial densities, but can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of pipes and tanks of artificial water systems such as domestic plumbing (taps, showers, etc), ornamental fountains and spa pools, where _Legionella_ multiply to high densities and contaminate the water supply. The water temperature in hot tubs is kept between 30 and 40 deg.C [approx. 86-104 deg.F], the optimum temperature for _Legionella_ to grow (at temperatures below 20 deg.C [approx. 68 deg.F], the bacteria are dormant, and at temperatures above 60 deg C [approx. 140 deg.F], _Legionella_ are killed over time).The hot tub has a circulator pump to ensure the water flows around the occupants. Aerosols of _Legionella_ are apparently formed when the circulator vigorously agitates the water. People can inhale these infectious aerosols. Exposing the lungs to the bacteria can then lead, in susceptible people, to legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the disease or Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form.People can be exposed to these aerosols not only while using a hot tub, but also by being close enough to breathe in the fine spray created, such as, by observing a demonstration of a hot tub, as apparently occurred in the Stoke-on-Trent (England) outbreak in which 19 cases were confirmed as legionnaires' disease (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK (13): (England) fatal, hot tub 20120816.1246273).Culture for _Legionella_ of sputum and suspected environmental sources and genotyping the isolates will help delineate transmission pathways. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information as it develops on the source for these cases of legionnaires' disease in Florida. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212>.]
