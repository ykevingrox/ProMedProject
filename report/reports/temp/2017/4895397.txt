A 19 year old male from Okongoua village [Omaheke region] was bitten by a tick on 1 Mar 2017.""The patient presented CCHF like symptoms on 5 Mar 2017 at the Corridor Post 13 Primary Health Care Clinic,"" the ministry's spokesperson Ester Paulus announced. She said the ministry immediately transferred the patient to Gobabis State Hospital for treatment and for collection of samples.On [Wed 8 Mar 2017] the patient was transferred to Windhoek Central Hospital for further treatment and isolation. Results were presented yesterday [9 Mar 2017] and indicated positive to Congo fever. ""The patient remains stable and is still being treated in the isolation unit at Windhoek Central Hospital. Ministry officials are busy conducting investigations, providing health education and have started disinfecting the household at the village where the patients comes from,"" Paulus said.A person with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever can have sudden onset of high fever, headache, back pain, joint pain, abdominal pain, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, bleeding, bruising, or a rash. The person has been in contact with a person who has similar symptoms, or animal infested with ticks, or has had a tick bite.In addition, the person may also have any of the following: nausea, vomiting, sore throat, sharp mood swings, confusion.One can get Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever through tick bites, or handling ticks with bare hands; direct contact with infected animal blood and organs, including slaughter of animals with ticks attached; handling contaminated linen, beddings, and clothes; or using contaminated medical equipment and supplies; direct physical contact with body fluids or blood of a person sufferingfrom CCHF; direct contact with a body of a person who has died of CCHF. If you are experiencing one of the above-listed signs after a tick bite, please contact the nearest health facility.In order to prevent CCHF, you are advised to check yourself for ticks after working with animals, and remove them immediately using fine-tipped tweezers (or a thread) and protect your hands; if your animals are infested with ticks spray them using a recommended acaricide to kill the ticks; avoid areas where tick vectors are abundant and when they are active (spring to fall); avoid direct physical contact with body fluids such as blood, saliva, vomitus, stool, urine, and sweat from infected persons; if you are in contact with a suspected patient, wash your hands with soap and water immediately; do not use skin piercing instruments which have been used by a person suspected to have CCHF; avoid direct contact with dead bodies of people who have died of CCHF; avoid using beddings and clothes of people who have died of CCHF.We do not have an efficient vaccine or a specific treatment for CCHF. However outbreak control measures are rather simple and appear very effective if they are fully accepted by the affected populations.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[According to the report above, the case was result of a tick bite on 1 Mar 2017, followed by clinical symptoms 4 days later.
