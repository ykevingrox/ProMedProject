The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.For a discussion of leptospirosis in Philippines, see my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - Philippines (02): (Manila,ZN)20110716.2154.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/r/1z-3>. - Mod.ML]
