Reading a ministerial statement in the National Assembly on [Tue 10 Oct 2017], Shifeta said the destruction of carcasses has started since high mortality cases of the water mammals were observed during the period from [Sun 1 to Sat 7 Oct 2017].Shifeta said it was assumed that the low level of the Kavango River led to the anthrax bacteria, which naturally occurs in the environment, to become active. ""Due to the nature of the anthrax disease, local communities have been sensitised not to touch any carcass or consume any meat from wildlife found dead, as a precautionary measure,"" he said. Handling such meat or eating meat from such an animal puts people at serious risk of contracting anthrax.According to the environment ministry, the national populations of hippopotami is estimated at just over 3000 and buffaloes over 7000. The population of hippopotami in Bwabwata West (a stretch of 24 km -approx 16 mi- of the Kavango River) increased from an estimated 384 animals in 2013 to 539 animals in 2017, the minister said [with the 2017 population this represents a mortality rate of 20 percent. - Mod.MHJ].The Ministry of Environment and Tourism staff discovered 10 hippopotami carcasses during an unrelated operation on [Sun 1 Oct 2017], which prompted the ministry to conduct aerial assessments. At the end of the 2 aerial assessments, a total 109 hippopotami and 20 buffalo carcasses were counted. A 3rd mortality count is planned to be conducted by boat on Thursday, Shifeta stated.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>******[2]Date: Wed 11 Oct 2017Source: New Era [edited]<https://www.newera.com.na/2017/10/11/buffalo-dying-too-in-bwabwata-from-suspected-anthrax/>An aerial assessment has revealed the carcasses of 20 buffalo suspected of dying from anthrax contamination that has killed nearly 110 hippopotami since the start of October [2017] in the popular tourist destination, Bwabwata National Park. Yesterday [Tue 10 Oct 2017], the Environment Minister Pohamba Shifeta informed the parliament that the laboratory tests are underway, but so far no final results are available on the possible cause of death of the animals. ""The Rundu Office of the State Veterinarian took samples for laboratory tests on [Mon 9 Oct 2017] to determine the exact cause of mortality,"" Shifeta told parliament.A high-level delegation from the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry will be visiting Bwabwata West today [Wed 11 Oct 2017] for an assessment, while a 3rd mortality count is due to be conducted by boat on [Thu 12 Oct 2017].The deputy director for the north-eastern regions in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), Apollinaris Kanyinga, told New Era at Rundu that the 20 buffalo carcasses were spotted when MET officials flew over the park. The carcasses were detected near streams connecting to the perennial Kavango River, where 107 hippopotami deaths have been recorded since [2 Oct 2017]. The environment minister [put] the number of dead hippopotami  at 109, and not 107, as indicated by the director in the region.On [2 Oct 2017], 52 dead hippopotami were discovered. By [7 Oct 2017], the number of dead hippopotami  had increased to 107 during the 2nd count and 20 buffaloes were also discovered during that count last weekend. ""We still didn't do a 3rd count,"" Kanyinga said. Kanyinga added that the state veterinarians from the Ministry of Agriculture were still in the park to test for and confirm the prevalence of the lethal anthrax disease believed to be killing wildlife in considerable numbers.Shifeta said the destruction of the carcasses had started and would continue, as and when practical. To date, he said MET staff had disposed of only 3 hippopotami carcasses. ""Carcasses are both on land and water. The regional (MET) office has started the process to procure protective gear for staff members involved in this situation,"" Shifeta said.He said the Ministry of Health and Social Services had also been informed and was very much involved, saying it had given 500 disposable nose masks to the MET. Anthrax is suspected to be the main cause of the rising wildlife mortality figures. Shifeta said the assumption was that the low level of the Kavango River caused anthrax bacteria, which occur naturally in the environment, to become active.Bwabwata National Park spreads over the Zambezi and Kavango East regions, extending along the Zambezi Strip. It is bounded by the Kavango River to the west and the Kwando River to the east. Angola lies to the north and Botswana to the south. The park, which forms part of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, is a popular destination for tourists.[Byline: John Muyamba]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The New Era report (2) has an excellent picture of 3 grazing buffalo -- 2 cows and a heifer -- in shoddy condition. It is the dry season and quality grazing is scarce. Disposing of some 129 carcasses is going to be a severe challenge, especially when one is not totally prepared. To have ""disposed"" of 3 at such short notice suggests that burial was done to learn what will be involved for the rest. Felling trees for incineration would have demanded more time, especially if you are not blessed with Canadian 'Hot-Shot' experts and expertise. Providing ""nose masks"" is very kind but handling these carcasses will not be a pneumonic risk. The real risk is from cutaneous anthrax from the contaminated wet carcasses. They will need boots, gloves, and paper boiler suits. The latter are easily burnt at the end of the day. With cloth overalls they would need an efficient functional laundry; plus showers, so the men can wash off at the end of each day. - Mod.MHJA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/163>.]
