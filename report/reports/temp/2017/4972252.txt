Fox News [edited]<http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/04/07/san-diego-woman-dies-after-turmeric-infusion.html>A San Diego woman who died in March [2017] had visited a naturopathic practitioner who administered an intravenous infusion (IV) of turmeric solution to treat eczema, authorities said. The 30 year old became unresponsive after Dr Jim Kelly began administering 250 mL of the mixture at his office, NBC 7 reported.Kelly administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and called 911. The patient was later diagnosed with ""severe anoxic brain injury secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest, most likely due to turmeric infusion,"" an autopsy released on Thursday revealed. A medical examiner's report listed food allergies to soy protein, lactose and gluten, as well as hypothyroidism and pre-diabetes, but it was not clear if any of that contributed to her death, NBC 7 reported. She died after 6 days of hospitalization.Turmeric is used by naturopathic doctors to treat inflammatory issues like arthritis, though it was this patient's 1st infusion, NBC 7 reported. Her mother reportedly told investigators that she had used it in capsule form.""I'm not trying to imply defending him or being critical,"" Steve Schechter, a naturopathic practitioner who knows Kelly, told NBC 7. ""Every doctor, every therapist I know at times, has made mistakes, every person I know has used things correctly and you get that incredibly small percent of people who are hyper-reactive.""The death is being ruled accidental, and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department told NBC 7 they're not involved in any criminal investigation. No administrative charges have been filed regarding Kelly's death.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[I am familiar with oral dosing of turmeric but not having it infused through an IV. Since the victim took the product orally, it may have set her up for a hypersensitivity reaction.Very high oral dose experiments in mice resulted in some of the mice with cardiac changes. It is unknown what dose the victim took or for how long she had been taking it. Also this article provides with no information of possible pre-existing conditions turmeric may have exacerbated. - Mod.TGA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/371>.].................................................Jh/tg/ec/sh"
