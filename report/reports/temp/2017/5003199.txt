CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Conference [edited]<https://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/cdc-24-7/eis-conference/pdf/66th_2017_EIS_conf_book_FINAL2_508.pdf> (pp. 53)Ref: Bonwitt J, Dykstra E, Tran M, et al: Unusual pathogen associated with nonbiting flies in a person with bacteremia -- Washington State, 2016----------------------------------------------------------------------_Wohlfahrtiimonas chitiniclastica_ is a rarely reported cause of bacterial infection associated with skin lesions and sepsis. It has been isolated in nonbiting flies that can cause myiasis (fly larvae infestation); however, it has neither been isolated from fly larvae on patients with _W. chitiniclastica_ infection, nor from insects in the Americas. In August 2016, a man was hospitalized in Washington State with necrosis of the foot, myiasis, and _Wohlfahrtiimonas_ spp. bacteremia. We investigated to determine exposure source.We attempted to collect live and dead insects (including fly eggs and larvae) from the patient and patient's home and culture them for _Wohlfahrtiimonas_ spp. at different lifecycle phases. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on isolates to assess relatedness. Recent patient travel history was obtained through proxy interviews.We collected 8 insect species from inside the patient's home. Although larvae present on the patient when hospitalized were unavailable for testing, _Wohlfahrtiimonas_ spp. was isolated from larvae collected from the carpet where the patient was found by emergency responders. These larvae were not taxonomically identified. _Wohlfahrtiimonas spp._ was also isolated from larvae hatched from eggs of a green bottle fly (_Lucilia sericata_) caught inside the home. PFGE results are pending. No travel outside of Washington was reported.We report the 1st isolation of _Wohlfahrtiimonas_ spp. in insects in the Americas and a previously undescribed vector, the green bottle fly. Our investigation provides further evidence of fly larvae as vectors for human infection. Green bottle fly larvae are a common cause of myiasis; patients with myiasis should be considered at risk for _Wohlfahrtiimonas_ spp. infection.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Myiasis (<https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/myiasis/faqs.html>) is infection with a fly larva, usually occurring in tropical and subtropical areas. There are several ways for flies to transmit their larvae to people. Some flies attach their eggs to mosquitoes and wait for mosquitoes to bite people. Their larvae then enter these bites. Other flies' larvae burrow into skin. These fly larvae are known as screwworms. They can enter skin through people's bare feet when they walk through soil containing fly eggs or attach themselves to people's clothes and then burrow into their skin. Some flies deposit their larvae on or near a wound or sore, depositing eggs in sloughing-off dead tissue.Although in many instances, no clear bacterial infection occurs, infection can occur in the wound which, as demonstrated in the posting, may be linked to the fly larvae themselves. _W. chitiniclastica_, a short Gram negative facultative bacterium with chitinase activity, was first reported to be isolated from 3rd-stage larvae of the _Wohlfahrtia magnifica_, the spotted flesh fly, in 2008. Reported cases of human infection with this organism are mostly bacteremias and have been reported from Europe [1, 2], South America [3], Africa, and Asia as well as in the USA (both continental USA [4] and Hawaii [5].Although _Wohlfahrtia magnifica_ may be the major reservoir for the organism, other fly maggots may be involved. Although the posting reports that _L. sericata_ has not previously been linked to _W. chitiniclastica_ human infection, the UK report [2] also reported that the green bottle fly larva could be linked to this infection but did not attempt to isolate the organism from the larvae. Based on several of the case reports, the organism is sensitive to all antimicrobials tested.In the de Dios case [4] the organism initially misidentiÂ ed as _Acinetobacter lwofÂ i_ by Vitek-2, the isolate was subsequently identiÂ ed as _W. chitiniclastica_ by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of Ââight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. It is certainly likely that in less sophisticated laboratory situations, the organism is misidentified.References----------1.
