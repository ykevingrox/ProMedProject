""The samples of 3 patients' muscle tissue were tested by the Calmette Hospital's laboratory and the result confirmed that there were _Trichinella_ larvae in their muscle tissue,"" the statement said.It added that another test on the blood samples from other 9 patients by a Vietnamese hospital's laboratory confirmed that ""there were eggs of _Trichinella_ worms"" in their blood.According to the statement, the 1st symptoms of trichinellosis include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort. Abdominal pains can occur one to two days after infection, and further symptoms such as headaches, fevers, chills, cough, swelling of the face and eyes, aching joints and muscle pains, itchy skin, diarrhea, or constipation usually start 2 to 8 weeks after eating contaminated meat. If the infection is heavy, patients may experience difficulty in coordinating movements, and have heart and breathing problems, it said, adding that in severe cases, death can occur.Cambodian Minister of Health Mam Bunheng called on the people, especially those in the affected area, to see doctors as soon as possible if they suspected that they had infected with trichinellosis.""I'd like to appeal to the people to stop eating raw or undercooked meat in order to prevent themselves from infecting trichinellosis and other diseases,"" he said in a statement.[Byline: Xiang Bo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[_Trichinella_ spp. is found in carnivores and in distributed worldwide, even in the arctic. Eating undercooked pork meat or wild boar has a high risk of infection. The text states that eggs of the _Trichinella_ was found in the blood. This is probably a mistake. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall, circulate in the blood and are encapsulated in muscles. The _Trichinella_ spp. nematode does not produce eggs and the short period where larvae are found in the intestine are missed because it is so early that there are very few symptoms if any. Diagnosis is suggested by high fever, high eosinophil count (and total IgE), muscle pain, periorbital edema and a history of eating undercooked meat of a carnivore.More information on the life and life cycle of _Trichinella_ spp. can be found here <https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/trichinellosis/biology.html>. - Mod.EPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/145>.]
