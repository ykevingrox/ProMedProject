Their reports showed that the outbreak had spread in Guadeloupe Archipelago from Marie-Galante island and in Martinique, the center and the south of the island are currently the most affected areas. As of today [Wed 7 Jun 2017], around 35 percent of municipalities of the 2 territories do not report any case. The peak does not seem to have been reached.In order to determine the etiology of this outbreak, biological samples were performed on conjunctiva and naso-pharynx from cases of conjunctivitis who consulted in emergency departments of the main public hospitals of both territories. The 1st analyses confirmed presence of enteroviruses with significant viral loads. Results from biological investigation of adenovirus are not yet known. Among the conjunctivitis specimens testing positive for enteroviruses, samples were sent to the National Reference Centre for Enteroviruses (Lyon, France) for further characterization.Outbreaks of viral conjunctivitis occur mainly in tropical countries with high population density, hot and humid climate. They are mostly attributed to adenoviruses and enteroviruses (EV). Enteroviruses are ubiquitous pathogens responsible for a large range of infections. There is no specific antiviral treatment.In the Caribbean and in the American region, several outbreaks of conjunctivitis have also been reported (Haiti, Dominican Republic, Mexico, French Guiana and Surinam) but the pathogen has not yet been identified.The source of the week epidemiological bulletin (will be update soon at this link): <http://invs.santepubliquefrance.fr/Publications-et-outils/Points-epidemiologiques>.--Aubert LydericNational Public Health AgencyRegional Office of French Caribbean Territories<lyderic.aubert@santepubliquefrance.fr>[Conjunctivitis, also known as pinkeye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the thin clear tissue that lies over the white part of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelid.There are a number of different causes, including infectious agents such as Viruses (Adenoviruses, Enteroviruses), Bacteria (gonorrhea or chlamydia), or Allergies to dust, pollen, contact lenses.Both viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are highly contagious. Each of these types of germs can spread from person to person in different ways. They are usually spread from an infected person to others through:- close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands- the air by coughing and sneezing- touching an object or surface with germs on it, then touching your eyes before washing your hands.<https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/about/transmission.html>.Infectious conjunctivitis caused by some bacteria and viruses can spread easily from person to person, but is not a serious health risk if diagnosed promptly.As confirmed by laboratory diagnosis in the above report, the causative agent for most of the tested cases was enteroviruses.Most cases of viral conjunctivitis are mild. The infection will usually clear up in 7 to 14 days without treatment and without any long-term consequences. But in some cases, viral conjunctivitis can take 2 to 3 weeks or more to clear up. An antiviral medication can be prescribed to treat more serious forms of conjunctivitis for which there is a specific treatment, such as those caused by herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus. Antibiotics will not improve viral conjunctivitis. - Mod.UBA][The HealthMap/ProMED maps can be found at:Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57615> and,Martinique: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/43638>. - Mod.MPP][See Also:Conjunctivitis - Mexico: (TM) 20170413.49689312016----Conjunctivitis, viral - Angola (LU) Tonga (TT) 20160510.4213295Conjunctivitis, viral - Fiji 20160401.4133819Raoultella planticola: conjunctivitis 20160110.39235552014----Conjunctivitis - Somalia: (BN) Mogadishu 20141207.3016591Conjunctivitis - India: (KA) 20141031.2920135Conjunctivitis - Thailand (02): update 20140910.2764769Conjunctivitis - Thailand: (BK) 20140903.2746516Conjunctivitis, viral - USA: (Guam) 20140603.2516044Conjunctivitis, viral - India: (MH) adenovirus 20140508.2458446Conjunctivitis - Oman: (Muscat) expatriates 20140313.2329930].................................................jh/uba/ao/mpp"
