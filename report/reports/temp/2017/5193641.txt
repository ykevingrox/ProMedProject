Duluth News Tribune, Wisconsin Public Radio report [edited]<http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/health/4299021-mosquito-capable-carrying-zika-found-wisconsin>The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported [Mon 17 Jul 2017] that a species of mosquito capable of carrying the Zika virus has been found in the state for the 1st time.The _Aedes albopictus_, or Asian tiger mosquito as it's commonly known, is one type of mosquito that can spread Zika. It was discovered in Dane County, and only 3 of that type were found.""It was only 3 mosquitoes that we've been able to detect,"" said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz. ""And we went back out to the same location and have looked and just haven't been finding them. So at the end of the summer I might say something different after we've looked in more places and had longer to see if this represents an opportunity for these mosquitoes to get more of a foothold.""Paskewitz said it's not surprising to find this specific mosquito; surrounding states such have _A. albopictus_, but the mosquitoes tend to die off.""Minnesota, for example, has reported them 17 different times and not a single time have they persisted. They seem to be introduced from other places, but they're not likely to get to any high population level that would cause us problems, at least in the near term.""State health officials say Zika is primarily spread by another mosquito, the _A. aegypti_, which lives in warmer climates. That mosquito has not been found in Wisconsin or any neighboring states.Wisconsin has had 67 confirmed cases of Zika since 2016. All are travel-related; none of the infections were locally acquired.[Byline: Shamane Mills]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6386>. Dane County can be seen on the map at <http://geology.com/county-map/wisconsin-county-map.gif>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJAlthough most of the new localities in which _Aedes albopictus_ has been detected have been in California, the species has been extending its known range northward and recently has been found in Nebraska, Connecticut, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, and now, Wisconsin. Unlike _A. aegypti_, _A. albopictus_ eggs can go into diapause and withstand freezing winter temperatures. However, as University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Susan Paskewitz points out above, viable populations of this species have not yet become established in these northern states.While most reports identify _A. albopictus_ as vectors of dangerous tropical and subtropical viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, no mention is made about their potential role as vectors of viruses that are of public health concern in temperate zones in the eastern USA -- La Crosse and Jamestown Canyon. It has been shown in the laboratory that this mosquito species is susceptible to infection by both of these orthobunyaviruses. Dual infections by both of these viruses can result in reassortment of the 3 RNA strands, with all 6 reassortants produced. These 2 viruses can co-circulate in the same woodlands in places like southwestern Wisconsin. Should _A. albopictus_ become established in ecosystems where these 2 viruses are endemic, the emergence of new, reassorted viruses is possible. - Mod.TY]
