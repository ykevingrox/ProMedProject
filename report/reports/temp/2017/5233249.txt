""This is a wrong move that caused the spread of the disease in the camp, prompting officials to return 64 infected people to the isolation unit again, in order to receive treatment.""Earlier this week [week ending 6 Aug 2017] sources in the camp said that the isolation wards have been filled with patients that prompted Doctors without Borders (MSF) to set up a new tent for isolation.North Darfur------------A total of 4 people died of cholera while 35 others have been infected in Ghurrat El Farajawiya in El Sareif Beni Hussein locality on [Wed 2 and Thu 3 Aug 2017]. A volunteer from the village told Radio Dabanga this week that 30 people from Ghurrat El Farajawiya were infected with cholera, 2 of whom died after being taken to the medical isolation ward in the neighboring Ghurrat El Zawiya. ""Two people died in the village and 7 others were infected."" The infected cases were taken to Kabkabiya and Ghurrat El Zawiya for treatment. ""Teams of Doctors without Borders have embarked in campaigns to spray the ponds and sterilize the village's water wells on [Thu 3 Aug 2017].""This week [week ending 6 Aug 2017] the public health specialist at the Ministry of Health in North Darfur, Esam Osman Zakaria, resigned from the ministry in protest against the government's silence and denial of cholera.Red Sea-------In Tokar, Red Sea state -- in eastern Sudan --, 2 people have died of cholera this week [week ending 6 Aug 2017]. The total number of deaths has risen to 5 and more than 100 infections in a week's time.Reporting to Radio Dabanga, journalist Osman Hashim said that 2 people died of cholera on [Wed 2 Aug 2017], before they arrived in the hospital. The number of cholera cases in the two isolation units in Tokar hospital has amounted to more than 100 people.The hospital received more than 20 people suffering from cholera on [Thu 3 Aug 2017]. Most of the infections in Tokar originate from the districts surrounding the town, such as Korek, Khojali, Baghdad, and Miskeit. These districts are overcrowded and lack clean water and toilets. Hashim: ""The authorities have not intensified health awareness programs. Meanwhile, the capacity of Tokar hospital is not consistent with the rapid increase in the spread of the disease.""Kassala-------The localities of New Halfa and Atbara River in Kassala have recorded a remarkable decrease in the rates of cholera. A health source in a hospital in New Halfa told Radio Dabanga that the number of cases in the isolation ward fell down to 30 cases on [Thu 3 Aug 2017] 2 cases arrived from Alawi, Um Najma, El Masna district, and the northern part of El Thora.Sennar------Meanwhile in Sennar state, the number of new cholera cases in the hospital of Sinja dropped to one patient on [Thu 3 Aug 2017]. A medical worker told this station that the hospital received one cholera case, while 2 cases still receive treatment there.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96>]******[2] Cholera - Kenya (Kisumu County)Date: Mon 31 Jul 2017Source: The Nation [edited]<http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Cholera-outbreak-in-Kisumu-County/1056-4039184-13xp1pqz/>One more person has succumbed to cholera while 3 others have tested positive for the disease in Kisumu. As many as 3 of the 4 cases occurred at aramogi Odinga Oginga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH).

No mortality has been reported giving a case fatality rate of 0 percent.In the period between [22 Jun and 19 Jul 2017], no new cases were line listed in Kakuma but Kalobeyei recorded 5 cases in this period on different days. Most of the new cases line-listed from [19 Jul 2017] have mainly come from the reception center in Kakuma and village 3 in Kalobeyei involving newly arrived refugees from both South Sudan and Burundi. Though the sanitation situation in the reception center has markedly improved, overcrowding, feeding on cold food that is communally prepared and refugees choosing to cook for themselves in open unhygienic areas due to lack of diversity in diet served, may also be contributing to cases developing in the reception centers.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3593>]******[4] Cholera - India (Kerala State)Date: Sun 6 Aug 2017 Source: The New Indian Express, Press Trust of India (PTI) [edited]<http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2017/aug/06/bid-to-contain-cholera-outbreak-in-mavoor-1639072.html>The Health Department has launched preventive measures on a war footing to control the spread of cholera among migrant workers at Mavoor panchayat in the district.

The NIH found _Vibrio cholera_ in stool samples of the 2 older children on [Mon 31 Jul 2017], while the result in the 3rd case is being awaited.The appearance of cholera cases in Rawalpindi is being termed as a great threat by a number of health experts as the infectious disease has a much higher mortality rate as compared to gastroenteritis or diarrhea and its spread is also much rapid. The confirmation of 2 cases of cholera from the BBH should not be taken as non-serious as the disease can be termed as 10 times more severe and serious in nature when compared to normal gastroenteritis or diarrhea, said Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University Dr. Tariq Saeed when contacted by 'The News' on Tuesday [1 Aug 2017]. He added that cholera causes rapid loss of fluid and its patient needs immediate hospitalization because the water loss in the body can be fatal if not treated well in time, and is therefore 10 times more life threatening than normal diarrhea and dehydration.--Communicated by:ProMED-mailpromed@promedmail.org[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/941>]******[7] Cholera, imported - South Korea (ex Philippines)Date: Mon 7 Aug 2017, 9:54 AMSource: Yonhap News [edited]<http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/08/07/0200000000AEN20170807002800320.html>South Korea has confirmed another case of cholera infection, raising the number of people infected here to 4 in 2017, health authorities said on [Mon 7 Aug 2017]. A 39-year-old Korean man was confirmed to have been infected with the waterborne bacterium after visiting the Philippines, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). He is now receiving treatment at a hospital and remains in a stable condition, the KCDC said.Earlier, South Korea reported 3 cholera patients in the latest outbreak of the disease. All 3 have contracted the disease after traveling abroad.The diarrheal disease, which is curable with proper medication and treatment, annually affects 3 million to 5 million people and claims more than 100 000 lives throughout the world.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of South Korea can be accessed at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195>The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:""As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as ""potentially the most important medical advance"" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).""The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.""References----------1.
