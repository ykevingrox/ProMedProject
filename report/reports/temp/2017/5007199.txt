Picayune Item [edited]<http://www.picayuneitem.com/2017/04/10-confirmed-cases-of-mumps-at-prcc/>Pearl River Community College is currently battling a mumps outbreak on the Poplarville campus. What started out as one confirmed case in early April 2017 has since spread to 10 students, all of which are either on the baseball team or in close contact with the team, vice president Dr Adam Breerwood said.After the 1st confirmed case, Breerwood said the school immediately contacted the Mississippi State Department of Health [MSDH] and initiated an emergency protocol, notifying faculty and students of the risk. All suspected areas of contagion were disinfected, specifically the workout and training areas and hand sanitizing containers often used by the baseball team, he said. As soon as students started to show symptoms, they were sent home to prevent further spread of the disease, Breerwood said. Some of the students have since returned to classes after being cleared by their doctors and the MSDH, he said.With most of the cases under control, Breerwood said he hopes the issue will be resolved shortly; however, the virus can stay in the body for up to 25 days. ""It's a unique situation,"" Breerwood said. ""We haven't heard of anybody getting the mumps in a number of years.""At the recommendation of MSDH, the college provided vaccinations for the students to prevent their risk of infection, Breerwood said. As of Thu [27 Apr 2017] morning, he awaited word on whether the agency would recommend another round of vaccines. Students are scheduled to move out of the dorms on 5 May 2017, giving college staff time to decontaminate any possible areas before summer classes begin, Breerwood said.The college currently doesn't require students to receive the mumps vaccine prior to enrollment, Breerwood said, but the administration is considering it now. ""This is what's somewhat ironic: LSU [Louisiana State University] had the same issue, and Loyola in New Orleans had it,"" Breerwood said. ""I was surprised to hear that [MSDH] has seen outbreaks in the last couple of years.""[byline: Julia Arenstam]--communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap showing the location of Mississippi, United States can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/227>.]******[2] Missouri, Southeast Missouri State UniversityDate: Sun 30 Apr 2017Source: Southeastern Missourian [edited]<http://www.semissourian.com/story/2408011.html>The university is optimistic it has passed the peak of a mumps outbreak 1st reported in February 2017, according to Southeast Missouri State University spokeswoman Ann Hayes. Hayes said as of Fri [28 Apr 2017], 58 students have confirmed cases of mumps, as determined by a medical test. ""Cape Girardeau Public Health is aware of these cases,"" Hayes said.Test results still have not returned for 5 students suspected of having mumps, Hayes said, adding these students have been out of class and at home since they were suspected of having the disease. Another 41 students tested negative for mumps, Hayes said, and 23 students are ""probable"" mumps cases. No testing was ordered because the students had a high exposure to other students who previously tested positive for mumps,"" Hayes said. ""We are continuing to see lower numbers [of mumps cases],"" she said.Southeast hosted vaccination clinics on 7, 9 and 10 Mar 2017 in partnership with the Cape Girardeau County Public Health Center and the Campus Health Clinic, where a vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, was made available to students. Southeast is publicly updating its information at <http://semo.edu/mumps>. As of Sat [29 Apr 2017] afternoon, the website had not been updated to reflect the most recent numbers, Hayes said.On 9 Mar 2017, the Southeast Missourian reported 29 confirmed cases of mumps on the campus.[byline: Marybeth Niederkorn]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap showing the location of Missouri, United States can be seen at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/227>.]******[3] Hawaii (Oahu)Date: Fri 28 Apr 2017Source: KHON 2 [edited]<http://khon2.com/2017/04/28/department-of-health-investigating-increase-in-mumps-cases-14-cases-this-year/>The State Department of Health [DoH] has confirmed 14 cases, all on Oahu, and says that none of the infected individuals have required hospitalization.Mumps is easily spread, and causes swollen salivary glands, puffy cheeks, and a swollen jaw. The infection used to be common nationwide, and decreased greatly after people started getting vaccinated. Still, state epidemiologist Dr Sarah Park says outbreaks still occur. ""When we talk and look at other states in the nation, they're seeing similarly. It's concerning. For whatever reason, there's a lot of mumps nationwide,"" Park said.Locally, Park is puzzled by the outbreak. Park says these cases are unusual, because cases are typically isolated. But investigators have been able to link 3 different clusters of mumps so far this year [2017]. ""It's the end of April [2017]. We're only 4 months into 2017, and we've already gone above what we normally see,"" she said. Park says the health department can't figure out what caused the mumps outbreak. ""Either they were in the same group, or some similar setting they were in. It's not necessarily relatives. With all respiratory disease, the closer we are together, the more likely we spread infection,"" Park said. ""We can connect this person to this person, and that person to that person, kind of like connect the dots. It's kind of frustrating. It's not been one unifying thing."" Park says the clusters of cases show how easily the infection spreads, and adds that the respiratory infection is more contagious than the flu. It is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes.In children, mumps is usually a mild disease. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults. Complications include:- meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord);- deafness (temporary or permanent);- encephalitis (swelling of the brain);- orchitis (swelling of the testicles) in males who have reached puberty;- oophoritis (swelling of the ovaries) and/or mastitis (swelling of the breasts) in females who have reached puberty.Officials also say that while cases have been reported in vaccinated individuals, the best protection against the disease is vaccination. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. The DoH says that all children should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. The 1st dose is given at age 12-15 months and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. All adults born in or after 1957 should also have documentation of vaccination, unless they have had a blood test showing they are immune to mumps. Certain adults at higher risk of exposure to mumps may need a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 88 per cent effective at protecting against mumps, and one dose is 78 per cent effective.Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus [family Paramyxovirus; genus _Rubulavirus_]. The classic symptom of mumps is called parotitis, which is a swelling of the salivary glands under the ears, resulting in a tender, swollen jaw. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Persons should seek medical attention immediately if they develop symptoms.People with mumps are most infectious in the several days before and after the onset of parotitis. The disease is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Transmission can also occur when sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, or by touching contaminated objects or surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Persons with mumps should stay home from school or work for 9 days after the onset of parotitis to keep from spreading the disease to others.Additional information about mumps can be found on the DoH website at <http://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/mumps/>.[byline: Brigette Namata]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[A HealthMap showing Hawaii can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/227>.]******[4] New York (State University of New York at Albany)Date: Sat 29 Apr 2017Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mumps-eight-cases-reported-ualbany-students-19080/>The State University of New York, University at Albany (UAlbany) is currently dealing with 8 confirmed cases of mumps in the student body.
