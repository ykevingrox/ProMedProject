Four days earlier on 9 May 2017, there was another case reported from Bisha, classified as a primary case, but high risk exposures were still under investigation. Presumably, more information will be available in the ensuing days or when the next WHO update on MERS-CoV is published. If this follows other recent nosocomial clusters, we may expect to see a few more newly confirmed cases, some asymptomatic individuals found to be positive during ""active"" case finding and contact screening, with hopefully few additional clinical cases. If any of our subscribers have more information on this nosocomial incident, we'd greatly appreciate receiving updated information.As of today, 14 May 2016, Saudi Arabia has confirmed 1604 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 662 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 41.3 percent) since reporting the 1st case on 15 Sep 2012. In the 16 days since the last update, there have been 8 newly confirmed cases, 4 deaths, and 6 recoveries reported. Of note is that the 8 cases come from 4 different regions in Saudi Arabia, and only one case was classified as a secondary case, while 7 were classified as primary cases with 5 of the 7 still under investigation for possible high risk exposures.

The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the cases reported between January and April 2017 do not show any significant difference when compared with cases reported during the same period from 2013 to 2016. The percentage of secondary cases from MERS reported during the 1st quarter of 2017 was 19% compared to 26% during the same period in 2016, and 33% in 2015 and 39% in 2014.- The age group of those aged 50-59 years continues to be the group at highest risk for acquiring infection as primary cases. For secondary cases, it is the age group of 30-39 years who are mostly at risk. The deaths are higher in the age group of 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[Graphics accompanying this report can be found at <http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/EMROPub_2017_EN_19671.pdf?ua=1> and provide updating of previously presented data. - Mod.MPP]******[3] Mild cases may be missedDate: 9 May 2017Source: CIDRAP [edited]<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/05/mers-study-indicates-mild-cases-might-be-missed>A new analysis of blood samples from people sickened in South Korea's MERS-CoV outbreak showed variable antibody response, including undetectable antibodies in mild cases, which might complicate seroprevalence studies and convalescent serum treatment.Four patients had undetectable antibodies:In the MERS-CoV study, researchers from South Korea and Hong Kong followed antibody titers of 11 patients with lab-confirmed infections over one year after treatment at a hospital in Seoul. The team published its findings yesterday [8 May 2017] in an early online edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases.Robust antibody responses were seen in people who had severe disease, with titers that waned over the 1st 6 months then held steady over the following 6 months. Duration of RNA detection in sputum correlated with the magnitude of antibody response.In 4 of 6 people who had mild disease, however, antibodies were undetectable, though most had pneumonia during their illnesses.Researchers said their findings support other antibody findings from survivors in Saudi Arabia and Jordan and in patients with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).The results suggest that MERS-CoV antibody tests can identify only some patients who had infections and that seroprevalence studies might underestimate the extent of mild illnesses in a population, the team reported.Also, they said plasma with the highest antibody titers will probably be available only from people who had severe illness within 6 months of their infections.""To use convalescent-phase patient plasma for treatment, it will be necessary to assess the antibody titer of potential donors before collection to ensure good antibody titer,"" the group wrote. The authors added that, while the neutralization test might be ideal for assessing plasma for therapy, their finding that ELISA testing results correlated well with neutralization titers demonstrates that it might also be a useful screening test.[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall[The article referred to in the above report from CIDRAP is: Choe PG, Perera RAPM, Park WB, Song K-H, Bang JH, Kim ES, et al. MERS-CoV antibody responses 1 year after symptom onset, South Korea, 2015. Emerg Infect Dis. July 2017, and can be found at: <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/7/17-0310_article>.""Abstract:We investigated the kinetics of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) neutralizing and spike protein antibody titers over the course of 1 year in 11 patients who were confirmed by reverse transcription PCR to have been infected during the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Robust antibody responses were detected in all survivors who had severe disease; responses remained detectable, albeit with some waning, for [less than] 1 year. The duration of viral RNA detection (but not viral load) in sputum significantly correlated with the antibody response magnitude. The MERS S1 ELISA antibody titers correlated well with the neutralizing antibody response. Antibody titers in 4 of 6 patients who had mild illness were undetectable even though most had evidence of pneumonia. This finding implies that MERS-CoV seroepidemiologic studies markedly underestimate the extent of mild and asymptomatic infection. Obtaining convalescent-phase plasma with high antibody titers to treat MERS will be challenging.""These findings are in agreement with those reported from Saudi Arabia in Alshukairi AN, Khalid I, Ahmed WA, Dada AM, Bayumi DT, Malic LS, et al. Antibody response and disease severity in healthcare worker MERS survivors. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016;22:1113-5 [available at <https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/6/16-0010_article>].The implication of these findings, which is clearly highlighted in both reports, is the caution needed to be taken in interpreting results of MERS-CoV retrospective serosurveys and in drawing conclusions from them about the burden of disease in an area. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>.]
