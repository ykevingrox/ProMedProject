We must prevent our children dying of measles.""The NPHCDA boss said all hands must be on desk to mobilize mothers to bring their children for measles immunization. And the vaccination is 100 percent free. He appealed to those states that are yet to release their counterpart funds to do so.He said that measles is a highly contagious disease that is caused by a virus and that it affects mostly children. It is one of the leading causes of death among young children. It spreads very quickly from child to child. A child who contracts measles can have reduced ability to fight other diseases, resulting in frequent illnesses.The measles vaccine campaign is expected to last from 26 Oct 2017 to March 2018.[Byline: Toyin Adebayo]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[This is an ambitious vaccination campaign that is a big step toward protecting children from contracting measles, as well as mumps and rubella.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Nigeria can be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62>. - Mod.LK]******[2] ItalyDate: Thu 14 Sep 2017Source: Eurosurveillance Edition 2017, 22(37) [edited]<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22876>Reference: Filia A, Bella A, Del Manso M, et al. Ongoing outbreak with well over 4000 measles cases in Italy from January to end August 2017 -- what is making elimination so difficult? Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(37): pii=30614---------------------------------------------Abstract. We report an ongoing measles outbreak in Italy, with over 4400 cases reported in 20 Regions from January-August 2017. Median age was 27 years, 88 percent of the cases were unvaccinated. The highest incidence was in infants below 1 year of age and 7 percent of cases occurred among healthcare workers. 3 deaths occurred and 2 cases of encephalitis were reported. Wide immunity gaps and nosocomial transmission are major challenges to measles elimination in Italy.Measles is targeted for elimination in Italy as in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region, however, Italy remains one of the 14 countries in the Region with ongoing endemic transmission. In January 2017, the Italian National Health Institute (Istituto Superiore di SanitÌÊ - ISS) detected an increase in the number of measles cases reported to the national measles and rubella integrated surveillance system, compared with previous months and years.We describe characteristics of cases reported in the 1st 8 months of 2017, main transmission settings, and control measures implemented.Vaccination status was known for 93.4 percent of cases (n=4182), of whom 88.3 percent (n=3691) were unvaccinated, 6.5 percent (n=271) had received only one dose of measles-containing vaccine, 1.6 percent (n=69) were fully vaccinated and 3.6 percent (n=151) had received an unknown number of doses.The probable transmission setting is known for 30.2 percent (n=1352) of the cases. Transmission occurred in families (64.1 percent; n=867), nosocomial settings (22.3 percent; n=301), schools (10.1 percent; n=137), and nomadic settlements (3.5 percent; n=47).Genotypes B3, D8, and H1 were identified: B3 and D8 represent endemic genotypes, while genotype H1 was identified only in one small outbreak at the beginning of the year [2017].Discussion. The main reason for this outbreak is an accumulation of a large pool of measles-susceptible population due to sustained low uptake of measles vaccine in Italy over the years. Measles vaccine uptake was very low in the years following its introduction in Italy in 1976 and this has led to large vaccination gaps among adolescents and young adults, and a constantly increasing median age of reported cases. The national measles elimination plan of 2011 called for supplementary immunisation activities among children over 2 years of age and susceptible groups, but these have been scarcely implemented. ...In 2016-17, measles outbreaks have also been reported in other European countries. Romania reported over 7000 cases and 31 deaths from January 2016 to June 2017. ...In conclusion, the size of the described outbreak highlights that there are wide measles immunity gaps in the Italian population, which together with nosocomial transmission are challenges to elimination. The new vaccination law in Italy will hopefully close immunity gaps in persons up to 16 years of age, but further efforts will be necessary to reach other susceptible groups, including young adults and HCWs [healthcare workers], through country-specific tailored strategies and to further strengthen surveillance and outbreak response.--Communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The full report, including tables, figures, and references is available at the source URL above.Vaccine hesitancy is at the root of the problem of continuing measles transmission, not only in Italy, but worldwide. Correcting this to bring the immune population up to a sufficiently high proportion is the only solution to the problem of increasing incidence of measles. With only 1.6 percent of the Italian population fully vaccinated, this population is almost entirely naive and fully susceptible.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Italy may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/75>. - Mod.LK]******[3] RomaniaDate: Mon 18 Sep 2017Source: Romania Insider [edited]<https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-new-measles-cases/>Romanian doctors diagnosed about 130 new measles cases in the last week, according to the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT). No deaths were recorded during this period.The measles outbreak began last fall [2016] in Romania. Over 9200 measles cases have been registered until Fri 15 Sep 2017, and 34 people died during these months. The biggest number of measles cases occurred in the 0-9 age group.Of the deaths, 9 occurred in Timis county, whereas 7 of them were in Dolj county. The disease has spread to 41 counties. Tulcea is the only county in Romania where no measles case has been yet recorded.Measles is an infectious disease that often leads to complications.

This advice was not limited to children only but also to any adult born after 1970 who had not had the measles and who might need booster shots he said.""Measles is a potentially serious disease. The HCDCP is systematically following the course of the epidemiological situation in Greece and worldwide, gauging the facts and may possibly, depending on how things develop, recommend additional measures,"" he said.Among possible complications caused by measles are ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis and many other serious and sometimes fatal health issues, he added, while the disease is highly contagious.He especially advised the need to debunk groundless rumours about the supposed risks of vaccines and inform parents and the public about the importance and safety of immunisation programmes.[Byline: Tasos Kokkinidis]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[If the National Centre for Public Health is able to promote the safety and importance of vaccination with MMR vaccine, that may help increase immunization levels in the country.

It was introduced by a traveller who contracted it in Bali, but it quickly spread in western Sydney, with 10 cases reported in the Auburn and Bankstown LGAs [local government areas] in one week.Prof Booy says measles is usually spread when a person breathes in the virus that has been coughed or sneezed into the air by an infectious person. Measles is one of our most contagious viruses, just being in the same room as someone can result in infection.""The 1st symptoms of the illness are fever, tiredness, runny nose, sore red eyes, conjunctivitis, and a cough,"" Prof Booy says. ""A few days later, a rash appears. The rash starts on the face, spreads down to the body, and lasts 4-7 days.""Up to 1/3rd of people with measles have complications, including ear infections, diarrhoea, and pneumonia, and may require hospitalisation.NSW Health reports that 1 in every 1000 people with measles develops encephalitis (swelling of the brain).All children and adults born during or after 1966 should be vaccinated with 2 doses of measles containing vaccine if not already immune.The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is recommended at 12 months, with the 2nd dose, which now includes varicella (MMRV), at 18 months.- Measles is a serious disease that is easily spread through the air;- measles is now rare in NSW because of immunisation;- people with measles are usually infectious from just before the symptoms begin until 4 days after the rash appears;- the time from exposure to becoming sick is usually about 10 days. The rash usually appears around 14 days after exposure.[Byline: Raylene Bliss]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[Because measles is easily imported with infected travelers, countries that are declared measles-free must still be vigilant in maintaining high levels of immunization in the population.A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Australia may be found at <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/284>. - Mod.LK]******[6] Australia (Victoria, New South Wales)Date: Tue 19 Sep 2017Source: Bendigo Advertiser [edited]<http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/4932536/measles-alert-three-cases-confirmed-in-victoria/?cs=3329>Two confirmed cases of measles in Melbourne have been discovered in the past week, sparking a warning to doctors and hospitals from Victoria's chief health officer.One person acquired the illness in Melbourne, and the 2nd may have been infected locally or overseas.A 3rd case of measles was confirmed late on Mon [18 Sep 2017] night. The Health Department said the 3rd person contracted the measles overseas, but at this stage, they believe it is not related to the other 2 cases.As the source of the infection is unknown, the Health Department has warned that there may already be secondary cases in the community that have not been diagnosed.Measles is highly infectious and airborne, and can stay in the environment for up to 2 hours. It has an incubation period of between 7 and 18 days. ...Symptoms of the measles include a general rash lasting 3 or more days and fever (at least 38C [100 F]) with the onset of the rash, and a cough, blocked nose, or conjunctivitis.Anyone who presents with symptoms compatible with measles should be tested and notified to the department.The latest cases take Victoria's total notifications of measles to 12 this year [2017], down from 37 this time last year.[Byline: Marika Dobbin-Thomas]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts<promed@promedmail.org>[While this report states that the number of measles cases in Victoria, 12, is lower this year [2017], down from 37 this time last year, it is interesting that the previous report observed that New South Wales has seen an increase in measles this year, with 23 cases reported, including 7 of those in children aged under 5 years. The outbreaks are likely focal due to introduction from a traveler, leading to disparate incidences in different locations. - Mod.LK]
