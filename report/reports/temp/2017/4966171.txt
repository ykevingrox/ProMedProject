Taipei Times, Central News Agency (CNA) report [edited]<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/04/10/2003668449>A Hualien County woman has contracted [see comment] rabies from a ferret-badger she found inside her home. The woman discovered the animal on 27 Mar 2017 and tried to give it water, but it attacked her, and some of its saliva splashed into her eyes, the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) said. After the animal died the next day, the woman sought treatment at a local clinic and tested positive for rabies [see comment], the CDC said.The woman, who has not been identified, was given a rabies immunoglobulin shot and has since received 3 shots of rabies vaccine and continues to be monitored by doctors, the agency said, adding that she has not shown any signs of infection.CDC deputy director-general Philip Lo said that 15 rabid ferret-badgers have been found so far this year [2017] in Hualien, Nantou, and Taitung counties as well as Kaohsiung, Chiayi, and Tainan.Rabies has a post-infection mortality rate of nearly 100 per cent; its latency period ranges from 1 to 3 months, but it can be as long as 6 months, Lo said.Anyone who is bitten or scratched by a wild animal, including stray dogs and cats, should immediately wash the wound with soap and water for 15 minutes, apply iodine or 70 per cent alcohol solution and immediately seek medical attention, the CDC said.Treatment consists of one injection of immunoglobulin, followed by 5 vaccinations -- on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28, Lo said.There have been no confirmed cases of rabies infection in humans this year [2017] and all 3 known cases of rabies in humans in Taiwan since 2002 were imported, the CDC said.A case in 2002 and another in 2012 involved people who were infected in China, while one in 2013 involved a person who was infected in the Philippines; all 3 died, it said.Taiwan was listed as a rabies-free nation for more than 50 years, until the Council of Agriculture admitted in 2013 that the bodies of 3 ferret-badgers that had died of rabies were found in 2012 in Yunlin County's Gukeng and in Yuchi and Lugu in Nantou County. The 1st case of a person being bitten by a wild Formosan ferret-badger infected with rabies occurred in Taitung County's Donghe Township in July 2013. Hundreds of rabid animals, predominantly ferret-badgers, have been reported in Taiwan since then.[byline: Jonathan Chin]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[The applied terms ""contracted"" and ""tested positive for rabies"", in reference to the patient (just) one day after her alleged exposure to a rabid animal, are in need of refinement/correction. Though the described exposure was indeed very challenging, saliva from a rabid animal splashing into the victim's eye, it is most unlikely, if not excluded, to diagnose her as ""infected"" one day post exposure and while, as the CDC agency said, ""she has not shown any signs of infection"". Hence, this exposed person is undergoing the post-exposure treatment according to WHO's recommended regimen, which, hopefully, will keep her alive and healthy.WHO's updated (2010) position paper on rabies vaccines and vaccination/prophylaxis regimens for pre- and post-exposure treatments in humans (in English & French, with links to Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish) is available for downloading at <http://www.who.int/wer/2010/wer8532/en/>.Statistics compiled by Taiwan's CDC in November 2016, showed that, since 2013, 549 rabies cases have been reported in 76 townships in 9 counties and cities around Taiwan. The disease was confined mainly to wild ferret-badgers, with only a few cases involving masked palm civets. The bureau urged the public to be on alert and avoid contact with wild animals. The disease resurfaced in Taiwan in 2013 after an absence lasting from at least 1961 (see item 1 in archive no. 20161122.4647936).The activities undertaken by Taiwan's public health and veterinary agencies to prevent human infection/disease and rabies introduction into the domestic animals population are commendable. - Mod.ASMaps of Taiwan can be seen at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/taiwan/taiwan-political-map.htm> and <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6415>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]******[2] Kyrgyzstan: (Batken) human, fatal, canine sourceDate: Mon 10 Apr 2017 17:48 KGTSource: AKIpress News Agency [edited]<http://akipress.com/news:591096/>A Batken region villager died of rabies after a dog bite, Turmush [News] correspondent reported. The incident took place on 6 Mar 2017 when the man was attacked and bitten by the dog. He was hospitalized the same day and was vaccinated.On 13 Mar 2017, the man was discharged from the hospital. According to the man's relatives, the man drank alcohol during the holidays and was again hospitalized on 22 Mar 2017. The man died on 24 Mar 2017.""Alcohol consumption kills the medication's effectiveness. The rabid dog was not found,"" the hospital said.--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[Attributing the development of clinical rabies in the patient and consequently his death to his alcohol consumption, in spite of (reportedly, timely) commencement of post-exposure treatment, is in need of better clarification. What treatment did he receive during the week of hospitalization? Generally, prompt post-exposure use of CCEEVs (cell-culture and embryonated egg-based vaccines), combined with proper wound management and simultaneous administration of rabies immunoglobulin, should be almost invariably effective in preventing rabies, even following high-risk exposure.Unfortunately, rare exceptions may and do occur; see ref 1.Reference---------1.
