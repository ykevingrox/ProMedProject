NBC News [edited]<http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/two-dead-raw-milk-cheese-contaminated-listeria-n731416>A total of 2 people have died and 4 more have been hospitalized in an outbreak of [listeriosis] linked to cheese made using raw milk, federal investigators said [on Thu 9 Mar 2017]. They've traced to cases to Ouleout cheese, a soft cheese made by Vulto Creamery in New York. The cheese is distributed nationally and it's all being recalled.""As many as 6 people infected with the outbreak strain of listeria have been reported from 4 states since [1 Sep 2016],"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement. ""All 6 people were hospitalized and 2 people from Connecticut and Vermont died. One illness was reported in a newborn. Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery of Walton, New York, is the likely source of this outbreak."" Raw milk that has not been pasteurized can carry bacteria such as listeria.""CDC recommends that consumers do not eat, restaurants do not serve, and retailers do not sell recalled soft raw milk cheeses made by Vulto Creamery,"" the agency said. Vulto Creamery has recalled all lots of Ouleout, Miranda, Heinennellie, and Willowemoc soft wash-rind raw milk cheeses.""_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a bacterium which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, pregnant women and others with weakened immune systems,"" the Food and Drug Administration said. ""Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths and fetal infection among pregnant women.""[Listeriosis] outbreaks are common. CDC estimates that [listeriosis] puts 1600 people into the hospital each year and kills 260 of them.There's a 2nd big recall of cheese going on over listeria fears. This one involves cheese distributed by Deutsch Kase Haus of Middlebury, Indiana and it includes products sold under various brand names, including Sargento, Biery Cheese, Yoke's Fresh Market, Amish Classics, Gussisberg Cheese and others. No one has been reported sick in this outbreak.[byline: Maggie Fox]--communicated by:ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>[In the USA, clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.The news report in this multistate cluster says that the common source was soft cheese made from unpasteurized milk by a producer in New York State and distributed nationally. Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of pathogens, which include _Brucella _ species, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_.In 1987, the United States Food and Drug Administration prohibited distribution of unpasteurized dairy products in interstate commerce for sale to consumers; however, sale of nonpasteurized dairy products within the state where they are produced is regulated by each state, and some states permit sale of these products (<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article>). To circumvent these regulations for commercial sale of unpasteurized milk, some states allow milk producers to distribute unpasteurized milk through cow-leasing programs, whereby members purchase shares in dairy cows in exchange for a percentage of the milk produced (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a2.htm>). We are not told the arrangements made for the interstate distribution of the unpasteurized cheese involved in this outbreak. - Mod.MLA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106>.]
