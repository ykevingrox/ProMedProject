The WHO update in section [2] below helps clarify that there are 3 simultaneous nosocomial outbreaks ongoing in Riyadh at the moment.After several months with minimal identified nosocomial transmission, one can't help but wonder what has occurred in Saudi Arabia to explain these ongoing transmission chains. - Mod.MPP]******[2] Saudi Arabia - WHO update 13 Jun 2017Date: 13 Jun 2017Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]<http://www.who.int/csr/don/13-june-2017-mers-saudi-arabia/en/>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 13 Jun 2017--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Between 1 and 10 Jun 2017, the national IHR focal point of Saudi Arabia reported 35 additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection including 3 fatal cases and 1 death among previously reported cases (case number 5 in the Disease Outbreak News published on 6 Jun 2017).Details of the cases--------------------Detailed information concerning the cases reported can be found in a separate document [see chart at end of this section].A total of 32 of the 35 newly reported cases are associated with 3 simultaneous clusters of MERS, of which 2 are related. A description of the 3 clusters is below.Cluster 1A cluster of MERS has been identified in a hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh Region; 23 cases associated with this cluster thus far and include the 1st identified case (a 47-year-old male reported on [1 Jun 2017]), 14 asymptomatic health care worker contacts, 1 household contact, and 7 hospital contacts who were patients.Cluster 2This MERS cluster is occurring in a 2nd hospital in Riyadh City, Riyadh Region. This cluster is related to cluster 1 above. The 1st identified case of this 2nd cluster visited the emergency room of the cluster 1 hospital. He was asymptomatic and following this visit in hospital 1, he continued to receive kidney dialysis sessions in the 2nd hospital. To date, this cluster involves 6 cases, including the case involved in cluster 1, and secondary household and health care worker contacts.Cluster 3This MERS cluster is currently occurring in a 3rd hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. To date the cluster involves the 4 cases including the 1st identified case who reported contacts with dromedary camels and 3 asymptomatic or mild cases that were health care worker contacts.Public health response----------------------The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia is evaluating each case and their contacts and implementing measures to limit further human-to-human transmission and bring these outbreaks to a control. These measures include:- Proper isolation for all confirmed cases;- Active tracing for all contacts of patients, healthcare workers and community contacts;- Identification of high and low risk contacts with daily monitoring for all during incubation period of the 14 days and performing laboratory testing for high risk contacts, regardless of the development of symptoms;- Regular updating of the line list of cases and contacts and conducting epidemiological analysis of data to identify the source of infection, links between patients and reasons for human-to-human transmission within hospitals;- Searching for suspected cases between patients and healthcare workers based on case definition of the disease;- Enforcement of strict adherence to proper environmental cleaning, disinfection and terminal cleaning and disinfection for hospital environment with special care in departments where the outbreaks are currently occurring or have occurred;- Enforcement of visual triage for respiratory diseases in emergency department and outpatient departments and ensure the 24/7 availability of a trained nurse for early detection of patients with respiratory symptoms, and proper documentation in triage forms;- Extensive training of all healthcare workers on case definition for early detection, implementation of isolation precautions, proper selection, donning and doffing of PPEs, hand hygiene and environmental cleaning and disinfection;- Ensuring that all healthcare workers tested for N95 fitting (fit test);- Ensuring availability of infection prevention supplies including hand sanitizer, PPEs, surface disinfectants, portable HEPA filters and fumigation machines;- Enforcing the implementation of a policy of not allowing healthcare workers to travel without medical clearance to prevent the spread of the virus to other countries.For cases that report contact with dromedary camels, investigations of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries is conducted by Ministry of Agriculture officials.Globally, 2015 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 703 related deaths have been reported to WHO since 2012.Line listing of newly

most recent WHO update on MERS-CoV, as of 10 Jun 2017 there have now been 2015 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO, including at least 703 related deaths, with Saudi Arabia having reported 1649 (81.8 percent) cases including 669 (95.2 percent) deaths. Additional information provided in the above reports is the existence of ongoing nosocomial transmission chains in 3 separate healthcare facilities with an apparent relation between 2 of the 3 facilities. The text above seems to suggest there was a possible asymptomatic contact that was in the emergency room of one hospital who then continued receiving renal dialysis at another hospital where he presumably began a 2nd chain of transmission. Unfortunately, the line listing accompanying this update does not ""connect the dots"" of the 3 transmission chains to enable actually tracing the chains of transmission.In the previous WHO update from 6 Jun 2017, there was mention of 3 clusters of transmission of which one occurred in Riyadh city (the other 2 clusters involved Bisha and Wadi Aldawasir, the latter in Riyadh province). According to that update: ""Cluster 2A cluster of cases has been identified in a hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. Cases associated with this cluster are:1st identified fatal case: A 55-year-old male reported to WHO on 14 May 2017.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 33-year-old male reported to WHO on 15 May 2017.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 30-year-old female reported to WHO on 15 May 2017.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 25-year-old female reported to WHO on 16 May 2017.Secondary case - Healthcare contact: A 38-year-old male reported to WHO on 17 May 2017.According to this update, the 3 chains of transmission began on 1 Jun 2017. One presumes that the 3 hospital outbreaks reported in today's update are not related to the earlier nosocomial outbreak reported in the middle of May 2017.Additional information on the 35 cases reported above is that case no.7 was reported as a fatality in today's Saudi MOH update (see section [1] above), and case no.27 was possibly the case reported as a recovery on 9 Jun 2017.We await further clarifications on these transmission chains.As mentioned above, one can't help but wonder what has occurred in Saudi Arabia to explain these ongoing nosocomial transmission chains after months of limited to none nosocomial transmission chains.The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/131>. - Mod.MPPA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59685>.]
