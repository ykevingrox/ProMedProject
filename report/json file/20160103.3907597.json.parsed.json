As of 15 March [2015], the country's Ministry of Health estimates there to be 29 938 cases of swine flu across India, resulting in 1731 deaths [2].

This is because 1 of the specific mutations can be linked to \"increased severity of the disease, while another enhances its infectiousness\" [4]. The mutations, alongside ideal environmental conditions such as high population density -- allowing for easier transmission -- has permitted the virus to become entrenched within the population [3]. According to Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious disease physician from the University of Florida, a majority of Indians do not get their flu vaccinations either [5].<br /><br />What's often concerning about this strain of swine flu in particular is its tendency to target young adults [5].

While flu typically strikes children and elderly populations the hardest, this year's H1N1 strain has shown to impact young adults the most. This is the same infection pattern as the 2009 and 1918 H1N1 pandemics [5]. In their commentary, Tharakaraman and Sasisekharana call for increased influenza surveillance and monitoring, to allow for further examination of the mutation of the influenza virus and its implications [3].\n\nContrary to the recently published research on the topic, India's National Institute of Virology claims that the swine flu virus strain currently causing the outbreak in the country is the same strain from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and that the strain has not mutated [1].\n \nByline: Colleen Nguyen\n\nSources\n\n[1] http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/study-indias-swine-flu-virus-may-have-mutated-into-more-dangerous-strain/2015/03/12/bdf8a11f-934f-4991-ba42-c2be7dd23748_story.html\n\n[2] http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indias-swine-flu-toll-climbs-to-1731-number-of-cases-touches-30000/articleshow/46583897.cms\n\n[3] http://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/abstract/S1931-3128%2815%2900076-1\n\n[4] http://time.com/3741736/swine-flu-h1n1-india-virus-mutation-study/\n\n[5] http://www.forbes.com/sites/fayeflam/2015/03/12/as-deadly-h1n1-spreads-in-india-scientists-find-worrisome-new-mutations/\n- See more at: http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/h1n1-mutates-india-32215#sthash.s8MsUpNL.dpuf\n\nI regularly check case counts on FluTrackers.com, but I have not been able to access the site since the start of 2016. According to Michael Coston, Editor of Avian Flu diary [http://afludiary.blogspot.com/], their hosting company - Linode - has been under a massive coordinated cyber attack since early yesterday, and that this is just the latest in a series of attacks which began Christmas day.  \n\nThis attack affects far more than just FluTrackers.... Linode's data centers in Atlanta, Dallas, Newark and London have all been affected, although only Atlanta remains down.  Cyber security presents a serious challenge on many levels. \n\nMaharashtra is a state in the western region of India and is the nation's 3rd largest state and is also the world's 2nd-most populous sub-national entity.
