Thinking it was flu he bounced among hospitals until finally being diagnosed with infectious hemorrhagic fever. He never imagined that the culprit was rats that stalked nearby. Hunan Province People's Hospital revealed that it has admitted 6 cases of infectious hemorrhagic fever in one week. Experts cautioned that winter and spring are peak season for this illness. Attention should be paid to environment and personal hygiene. Rodent prevention and extermination work should be done well.<br /><br />\"The factory cafeteria and dormitory have rats,\" said Zhu Shaobing, who works in a feed factory in Liuyang [also in Hunan province]. After lunch on 23 Dec [2015] he experienced dizziness and vomiting and, thinking it was flu, took cold medicine. On the 2nd day, his torso felt weak and he had lumbago. A family member accompanied him to a hospital in Xingsha for treatment. Based on lumbago, he was diagnosed with hyperosteogeny [excessive bone development] and admitted for treatment. Who knew that the same evening, Zhu Shaobin's condition would deteriorate and he would become incoherent? After a few days in this hospital without improvement, Zhu Shaobin was sent to Hunan Province People's Hospital Emergency Department on 29 Dec [2015].<br /><br />\"His temperature was elevated, his face was flushed and he had pain throughout his body,\" explained attending Hunan Province People's Hospital Emergency Department physician Yang Zhao. When admitted, Zhu Shaobin had high fever and \"3 reds\" (red face, red neck, red chest) and \"3 pains\" (head pain, waist pain, eye socket pain) and other classic symptoms of infectious hemorrhagic fever. At the same time, because of reduced platelet count, blood spots appeared on his body. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were low, evidencing kidney damage. Based on these factors, the physician diagnosed him as having infectious hemorrhagic fever and began treatment including antivirals, regulating immunity, stabilizing cell membranes and stopping bleeding.<br /><br />\"In the recent week our hospital has admitted 6 cases,\" said Yang Zhao. Infectious hemorrhagic fever is also called \"hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome\" [HFRS]. It is an acute illness caused by a virus, mainly transmitted by rodents. Occurrence is mainly at the junction of rural and suburban areas. Annual peak season is winter and spring. \"Many people believe only rat bites can cause hemorrhagic fever, but that's not actually so,\" said Yang Zhao. Rat feces and discharge carrying hemorrhagic fever virus can become microgranules that spread in the air. People who breathe in contaminated air or consume contaminated foods may be infected. Also, bites from mites that were on rat bodies can similarly cause spread of the virus. Pregnant patients can pass the virus to their fetus through the placenta.<br /><br />\"Initial symptoms of hemorrhagic fever are fever and headache, and can easily be misdiagnosed as flu. Yang Zhao cautioned that some patients experience symptoms of stomach ache, nausea, vomiting and are treated for acute cholecystitis [inflammation of the gallbladder] or gastroenteritis. Some patients have edema, oliguria [low output of urine] and are diagnosed with urinary tract disease. If detailed observation and questioning of the patient are not conducted, it is easy to diagnose and treat hemorrhagic fever as other illnesses, and affect progression of the disease. He pointed out that rodent prevention and extermination work is key to the prevention of hemorrhagic fever. Special attention should be paid to food, environmental and personal hygiene. When necessary, hemorrhagic fever vaccines can be used for protection.<br /><br />[Byline: Hong Lei]<br /><br />--<br />Communicated by:<br />ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver<br /><br />[This case is clearly one of HFRS. The specific hantavirus involved in this and the other cases mentioned was not stated. In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses with their main rodent reservoir species are: Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of HFRS frequently in China. A bunyavirus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, is unlikely, as during the winter season ticks, the vectors of this virus, will not be active.<br /><br />Hantaan virus has several (up to 5 have been reported) subtypes and is transmitted by the field mouse _Apodemus agrarius_, whereas Seoul virus is less variable and is transmitted by the rat _Rattus norvegicus_. A 3rd hantavirus that causes HFRS, Muju virus, has been reported from the Korean peninsula. Since Shandong province is coastal, and the cases are occurring in rural areas, either virus could be involved.
